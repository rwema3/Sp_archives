on this basis  its respiratory system would likely have been parabronchi  with multiple pulmonary air sacs as in avian lungs  and a flow through lung  an avian respiratory system would need a lung volume of about compared with a mammalian requirement of   which would exceed the space available  the overall thoracic volume of  apatosaurus  has been estimated at   allowing for a   four chambered heart and a lung capacity  that would allow about for the necessary tissue  evidence for the avian system in  apatosaurus  and other sauropods is also present in the pneumaticity of the vertebrae  though this plays a role in reducing the weight of the animal  wedel        states they are also likely connected to air sacs  as in birds 

james spotila et al         concludes that the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates because they would not have been able to release enough heat  they assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system  wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat  some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain  others suggest that the near horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated 

james farlow        calculates that an  apatosaurus  sized dinosaur about would have possessed of fermentation contents  assuming  apatosaurus  had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting metabolism  frank paladino etal         estimate the animal would have needed to consume only about of water per day 

a      microscopic study of  apatosaurus  and  brontosaurus  bones concluded the animals grew rapidly when young and reached near adult sizes in about   years  in       a study on the growth rates of sauropods was published by thomas lehman and holly woodward  they said that by using growth lines and length to mass ratios   apatosaurus  would have grown to   t     long tons     short tons  in   years  with growth peaking at in a single year  an alternative method  using limb length and body mass  found  apatosaurus  grew per year  and reached its full mass before it was about   years old  these estimates have been called unreliable because the calculation methods are not sound  old growth lines would have been obliterated by bone remodelling  one of the first identified growth factors of  apatosaurus  was the number of sacral vertebrae  which increased to five by the time of the creature s maturity  this was first noted in      and again in      

long bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached  a study by eva griebeler etal         examined long bone histological data and concluded the  apatosaurus  sp sma     weighed   reached sexual maturity at   years  and died aged     the same growth model indicated  apatosaurus  sp byu             weighed   reached sexual maturity at   years  and died aged    

compared with most sauropods  a relatively large amount of juvenile material is known from  apatosaurus   multiple specimens in the omnh are from juveniles of an undetermined species of  apatosaurus   this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles  some vertebrae  and limb bones  omnh juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals  the specimens exhibit features that distinguish  apatosaurus  from its relatives  and thus likely belong to the genus  juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails  and a more pronounced forelimb hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods 

an article published in      reported research of the mechanics of  apatosaurus  tails by nathan myhrvold and paleontologist philip j  currie  myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail  which in diplodocids like  apatosaurus  was a very long  tapering structure resembling a bullwhip  this computer modeling suggested diplodocids were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over     decibels  comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired 

a pathology has been identified on the tail of  apatosaurus   caused by a growth defect  two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone  including the arches of the neural spines  this defect might have been caused by the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints  it has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat and defense  but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to  shunosaurus  and mamenchisaurids  and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself 

the morrison formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which  according to radiometric dating  dates from between      mya at its base  and      mya at the top  placing it in the late oxfordian  kimmeridgian  and early tithonian stages of the late jurassic period  this formation is interpreted as originating in a locally semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons  the morrison basin  where dinosaurs lived  stretched from new mexico to alberta and saskatchewan  it was formed when the precursors to the front range of the rocky mountains started pushing up to the west  the deposits from their east facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands  lakes  river channels  and floodplains  this formation is similar in age to the lourinh   formation in portugal and the tendaguru formation in tanzania 
 apatosaurus  was the second most common sauropod in the morrison formation ecosystem  after  camarasaurus    apatosaurus  may have been more solitary than other morrison formation dinosaurs  fossils of the genus have only been found in the upper levels of the formation  those of  apatosaurus ajax  are known exclusively from the upper brushy basin member  about           mya   a louisae  fossils are rare  known only from one site in the upper brushy basin member  they date to the late kimmeridgian stage  about    mya  additional  apatosaurus  remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks  but they have not been identified as any particular species  and thus may instead belong to  brontosaurus  

the morrison formation records a time when the local environment was dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs  dinosaurs known from the morrison formation include the theropods  allosaurus    ceratosaurus    ornitholestes    saurophaganax   and  torvosaurus   the sauropods  brontosaurus    brachiosaurus    camarasaurus   and  diplodocus   and the ornithischians  camptosaurus    dryosaurus   and  stegosaurus    apatosaurus  is commonly found at the same sites as  allosaurus    camarasaurus    diplodocus   and  stegosaurus    allosaurus  accounted for          of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the morrison food web  many of the dinosaurs of the morrison formation are of the same genera as those seen in portuguese rocks of the lourinh   formationmainly  allosaurus    ceratosaurus   and  torvosaurus or have a close counterpart brachiosaurus  and  lusotitan    camptosaurus  and  draconyx   and  apatosaurus  and  dinheirosaurus   other vertebrates that are known to have shared this paleo environment include ray finned fishes  frogs  salamanders  turtles  sphenodonts  lizards  terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans  and several species of pterosaur  shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common  the flora of the period has been evidenced in fossils of green algae  fungi  mosses  horsetails  cycads  ginkgoes  and several families of conifers  vegetation varied from river lining forests of tree ferns with fern understory  gallery forests   to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the  araucaria  like conifer  brachyphyllum  





allosaurus

allosaurus    is a genus of carnivorous theropod dinosaur that lived     to      million years ago during the late jurassic period  kimmeridgian to early tithonian   the name   allosaurus   means  different lizard  alluding to its unique concave vertebrae  at the time of its discovery   it is derived from the greek   allos    different  other   and   sauros    lizard   generic reptile    the first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in      by paleontologist othniel charles marsh  as one of the first well known theropod dinosaurs  it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles  indeed  it has been a top feature in several films and documentaries about prehistoric life 

 allosaurus  was a large bipedal predator  its skull was large and equipped with dozens of sharp  serrated teeth  it averaged in length  though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over   relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs  its three fingered forelimbs were small  and the body was balanced by a long and heavily muscled tail  it is classified as an allosaurid  a type of carnosaurian theropod dinosaur  the genus has a complicated taxonomy  and includes an uncertain number of valid species  the best known of which is  a  fragilis   the bulk of  allosaurus  remains have come from north america s morrison formation  with material also known from portugal and possibly tanzania  it was known for over half of the   th century as  antrodemus   but a study of the copious remains from the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry brought the name   allosaurus   back to prominence and established it as one of the best known dinosaurs 

as the most abundant large predator in the morrison formation   allosaurus  was at the top of the food chain  probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs  and perhaps even other predators  potential prey included ornithopods  stegosaurids  and sauropods  some paleontologists interpret  allosaurus  as having had cooperative social behavior  and hunting in packs  while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other  and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses  due to having a much weaker bite force and a much wider gape than most other large carnivorous dinosaurs  it may have attacked large prey by ambush  using its upper jaw like a hatchet 

 allosaurus  was a typical large theropod  having a massive skull on a short neck  a long tail and reduced forelimbs   allosaurus fragilis   the best known species  had an average length of   with the largest definitive  allosaurus  specimen  amnh      estimated at long  and an estimated weight of   in his      monograph on  allosaurus   james h  madsen mentioned a range of bone sizes which he interpreted to show a maximum length of   as with dinosaurs in general  weight estimates are debatable  and since      have ranged between     and for modal adult weight  not maximum   john foster  a specialist on the morrison formation  suggests that is reasonable for large adults of  a  fragilis   but that is a closer estimate for individuals represented by the average sized thigh bones he has measured  using the subadult specimen nicknamed  big al   researchers using computer modelling arrived at a best estimate of for the individual  but by varying parameters they found a range from approximately to approximately  

several gigantic specimens have been attributed to  allosaurus   but may in fact belong to other genera  the closely related genus  saurophaganax   omnh       reached perhaps in length  and its single species has sometimes been included in the genus  allosaurus  as  allosaurus maximus   though recent studies support it as a separate genus  another potential specimen of  allosaurus   once assigned to the genus  epanterias   amnh        may have measured in length  a more recent discovery is a partial skeleton from the peterson quarry in morrison rocks of new mexico  this large allosaurid may be another individual of  saurophaganax  

david k  smith  examining  allosaurus  fossils by quarry  found that the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry  utah  specimens are generally smaller than those from como bluff  wyoming  or brigham young university s dry mesa quarry  colorado   but the shapes of the bones themselves did not vary between the sites  a later study by smith incorporating garden park  colorado  and dinosaur national monument  utah  specimens found no justification for multiple species based on skeletal variation  skull variation was most common and was gradational  suggesting individual variation was responsible  further work on size related variation again found no consistent differences  although the dry mesa material tended to clump together on the basis of the astragalus  an ankle bone  kenneth carpenter  using skull elements from the cleveland lloyd site  found wide variation between individuals  calling into question previous species level distinctions based on such features as the shape of the horns  and the proposed differentiation of  a  jimmadseni  based on the shape of the jugal 

the skull and teeth of  allosaurus  were modestly proportioned for a theropod of its size  paleontologist gregory s  paul gives a length of for a skull belonging to an individual he estimates at long  each premaxilla  the bones that formed the tip of the snout   held five teeth with d shaped cross sections  and each maxilla  the main tooth bearing bones in the upper jaw  had between    and    teeth  the number of teeth does not exactly correspond to the size of the bone  each dentary  the tooth bearing bone of the lower jaw  had between    and    teeth  with an average count of     the teeth became shorter  narrower  and more curved toward the back of the skull  all of the teeth had saw like edges  they were shed easily  and were replaced continually  making them common fossils 

the skull had a pair of horns above and in front of the eyes  these horns were composed of extensions of the lacrimal bones  and varied in shape and size  there were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns  the horns were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions  including acting as sunshades for the eye  being used for display  and being used in combat against other members of the same species  although they were fragile   there was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment  as is also seen in tyrannosaurids 

inside the lacrimal bones were depressions that may have held glands  such as salt glands  within the maxillae were sinuses that were better developed than those of more basal theropods such as  ceratosaurus  and  marshosaurus   they may have been related to the sense of smell  perhaps holding something like jacobson s organ  the roof of the braincase was thin  perhaps to improve thermoregulation for the brain  the skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units  in the lower jaws  the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated  permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal s gape  the braincase and frontals may also have had a joint 

 allosaurus  had nine vertebrae in the neck     in the back  and five in the sacrum supporting the hips  the number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size  james madsen estimated about     while gregory s  paul considered that to be too many and suggested    or less  there were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae  such spaces  which are also found in modern theropods  that is  the birds   are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration  the rib cage was broad  giving it a barrel chest  especially in comparison to less derived theropods like  ceratosaurus    allosaurus  had gastralia  belly ribs   but these are not common findings  and they may have ossified poorly  in one published case  the gastralia show evidence of injury during life  a furcula  wishbone  was also present  but has only been recognized since       in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia  the ilium  the main hip bone  was massive  and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground  madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry  independent of size  the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends  he suggested that this was a sexual characteristic  with females lacking fused bones to make egg laying easier  this proposal has not attracted further attention  however 

the forelimbs of  allosaurus  were short in comparison to the hindlimbs  only about     the length of the hindlimbs in adults  and had three fingers per hand  tipped with large  strongly curved and pointed claws  the arms were powerful  and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm         ulna humerus ratio   the wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans  of the three fingers  the innermost  or thumb  was the largest  and diverged from the others  the phalangeal formula is            meaning that the innermost finger  phalange  has two bones  the next has three  and the third finger has four  the legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids  and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof like than those of earlier theropods  each foot had three weight bearing toes and an inner dewclaw  which madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles  there was also what is interpreted as the splint like remnant of a fifth  outermost  metatarsal  perhaps used as a lever between the achilles tendon and foot 

the discovery and early study of  allosaurus  is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the bone wars of the late   th century  the first described fossil in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by ferdinand vandiveer hayden in       it came from middle park  near granby  colorado  probably from morrison formation rocks  the locals had identified such bones as  petrified horse hoofs   hayden sent his specimen to joseph leidy  who identified it as half of a tail vertebra  and tentatively assigned it to the european dinosaur genus  poekilopleuron  as  poicilopleuron   valens   he later decided it deserved its own genus   antrodemus  

 allosaurus  itself is based on ypm       a small collection of fragmentary bones including parts of three vertebrae  a rib fragment  a tooth  a toe bone  and  most useful for later discussions  the shaft of the right humerus  upper arm   othniel charles marsh gave these remains the formal name  allosaurus fragilis  in        allosaurus  comes from the greek  allos              meaning  strange  or  different  and  sauros                meaning  lizard  or  reptile   it was named  different lizard  because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery  the species epithet  fragilis  is latin for  fragile   referring to lightening features in the vertebrae  the bones were collected from the morrison formation of garden park  north of ca  on city  marsh and edward drinker cope  who were in scientific competition  went on to coin several other genera based on similarly sparse material that would later figure in the taxonomy of  allosaurus   these include marsh s  creosaurus  and  labrosaurus   and cope s  epanterias  

in their haste  cope and marsh did not always follow up on their discoveries  or  more commonly  those made by their subordinates   for example  after the discovery by benjamin mudge of the type specimen of  allosaurus  in colorado  marsh elected to concentrate work in wyoming  when work resumed at garden park in       m  p  felch found an almost complete  allosaurus  and several partial skeletons  in addition  one of cope s collectors  h  f  hubbell  found a specimen in the como bluff area of wyoming in       but apparently did not mention its completeness  and cope never unpacked it  upon unpacking in       several years after cope had died   it was found to be one of the most complete theropod specimens then known  and in      the skeleton  now cataloged as amnh       was put on public view  this is the well known mount poised over a partial  apatosaurus  skeleton as if scavenging it  illustrated as such by charles r  knight  although notable as the first free standing mount of a theropod dinosaur  and often illustrated and photographed  it has never been scientifically described 

the multiplicity of early names complicated later research  with the situation compounded by the terse descriptions provided by marsh and cope  even at the time  authors such as samuel wendell williston suggested that too many names had been coined  for example  williston pointed out in      that marsh had never been able to adequately distinguish  allosaurus  from  creosaurus   the most influential early attempt to sort out the convoluted situation was produced by charles w  gilmore in       he came to the conclusion that the tail vertebra named  antrodemus  by leidy was indistinguishable from those of  allosaurus   and  antrodemus  thus should be the preferred name because as the older name it had priority   antrodemus  became the accepted name for this familiar genus for over fifty years  until james madsen published on the cleveland lloyd specimens and concluded that  allosaurus  should be used because  antrodemus  was based on material with poor  if any  diagnostic features and locality information  for example  the geological formation that the single bone of  antrodemus  came from is unknown     antrodemus   has been used informally for convenience when distinguishing between the skull gilmore restored and the composite skull restored by madsen 

although sporadic work at what became known as the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry in emery county  utah had taken place as early as       and the fossil site itself described by william l  stokes in       major operations did not begin there until       under a cooperative effort involving nearly     institutions  thousands of bones were recovered between      and       the quarry is notable for the predominance of  allosaurus  remains  the condition of the specimens  and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be  the majority of bones belong to the large theropod  allosaurus fragilis   it is estimated that the remains of at least      a  fragilis  have been found there  out of at minimum     dinosaurs   and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well mixed  nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the taphonomy of the site  suggesting numerous mutually exclusive explanations for how it may have formed  suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog  to becoming trapped in deep mud  to falling victim to drought induced mortality around a waterhole  to getting trapped in a spring fed pond or seep  regardless of the actual cause  the great quantity of well preserved  allosaurus  remains has allowed this genus to be known in detail  making it among the best known theropods  skeletal remains from the quarry pertain to individuals of almost all ages and sizes  from less than to long  and the disarticulation is an advantage for describing bones usually found fused 

the period since madsen s monograph has been marked by a great expansion in studies dealing with topics concerning  allosaurus  in life  paleobiological and paleoecological topics   such studies have covered topics including skeletal variation  growth  skull construction  hunting methods  the brain  and the possibility of gregarious living and parental care  reanalysis of old material  particularly of large  allosaur  specimens   new discoveries in portugal  and several very complete new specimens have also contributed to the growing knowledge base 

in       big al   mor       a      complete  partially articulated specimen of  allosaurus  was discovered  it measured about    meters  about     ft  in length  mor     was excavated near shell  wyoming  by a joint museum of the rockies and university of wyoming geological museum team  this skeleton was discovered by a swiss team  led by kirby siber  in      the same team discovered a second  allosaurus    big al two   which is the best preserved skeleton of its kind to date 

the completeness  preservation  and scientific importance of this skeleton gave  big al  its name  the individual itself was below the average size for  allosaurus fragilis   and was a subadult estimated at only      grown  the specimen was described by breithaupt in       nineteen of its bones were broken or showed signs of infection  which may have contributed to  big al s  death  pathologic bones included five ribs  five vertebrae  and four bones of the feet  several damaged bones showed osteomyelitis  a bone infection  a particular problem for the living animal was infection and trauma to the right foot that probably affected movement and may have also predisposed the other foot to injury because of a change in gait  al had an infection on the first phalanx on the third toe that was afflicted by an involucrum  the infection was long lived  perhaps up to   months  big al two is also known to have multiple injuries 

there are currently four valid and one undescribed species of  allosaurus    a  amplus    a  europaeus   the type species  a  fragilis   the as yet not formally described  a  jimmadseni   and  a  lucasi   

 a  fragilis  is the type species and was named by marsh in       it is known from the remains of at least sixty individuals  all found in the kimmeridgian   tithonian upper jurassic age morrison formation of the united states  spread across the states of colorado  montana  new mexico  oklahoma  south dakota  utah  and wyoming  details of the humerus  upper arm  of  a  fragilis  have been used as diagnostic among morrison theropods  but the discovery of  a  jimmadseni  indicates that this will no longer be the case at the species level 

daniel chure s work on morrison allosaurid remains has been responsible  directly or indirectly  for  a  jimmadseni  and  a  maximus    a  jimmadseni  is the proposed name for a new species of morrison allosaur  based on a nearly complete skeleton and skull  it differs from  a  fragilis  in several anatomical details including a jugal or cheekbone with a straight lower margin  and is confined to the salt wash member of the morrison formation  while  a  fragilis  is only present in the higher brushy basin member 

 a  fragilis    a  jimmadseni    a  amplus   and  a  lucasi  are all known from remains discovered in the kimmeridgian   tithonian upper jurassic age morrison formation of the united states  spread across the states of colorado  montana  new mexico  oklahoma  south dakota  utah and wyoming   a  fragilis  is regarded as the most common  known from the remains of at least sixty individuals  for a while in the late     s and early     s it was common to recognize  a  fragilis  as the short snouted species  with the long snouted taxon being  a  atrox   however  subsequent analysis of specimens from the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry  como bluff  and dry mesa quarry showed that the differences seen in the morrison formation material could be attributed to individual variation  a study of skull elements from the cleveland lloyd site found wide variation between individuals  calling into question previous species level distinctions based on such features as the shape of the lacrimal horns  and the proposed differentiation of  a  jimmadseni  based on the shape of the jugal   a  europaeus  was found in the kimmeridgian age porto novo member of the lourinh   formation  but may be the same as  a  fragilis  

 allosaurus  material from portugal was first reported in      on the basis of mhnul and      a partial skeleton including a quadrate  vertebrae  ribs  gastralia  chevrons  part of the hips  and hindlimbs  this specimen was assigned to  a  fragilis   but the subsequent discovery of a partial skull and neck  ml      near lourinh    in the kimmeridgian age porto novo member of the lourinh   formation  spurred the naming of the new species  a  europaeus   it differs from other species of  allosaurus  in cranial details  however  more material may show it to be  a  fragilis   as originally described 

the issue of species and potential synonyms is complicated by the type specimen of  allosaurus fragilis   catalog number ypm        being extremely fragmentary  consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae  limb bone fragments  rib fragments  and a tooth  because of this  several scientists have interpreted the type specimen as potentially dubious  and thus the genus  allosaurus  itself or at least the species  a  fragilis  would be a  nomen dubium    dubious name   based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify   to address this situation  gregory s  paul and kenneth carpenter        submitted a petition to the iczn to have the name   a  fragilis   officially transferred to the more complete specimen usnm      as a neotype   this request is currently pending review 

 creosaurus    epanterias   and  labrosaurus  are regarded as junior synonyms of  allosaurus   most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of  a  fragilis   or that were misassigned to the genus  are obscure and were based on scrappy remains  one exception is  labrosaurus ferox   named in      by marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw  with a prominent gap in the tooth row at the tip of the jaw  and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down  later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic  showing an injury to the living animal  and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction  it is now regarded as an example of  a  fragilis  

in his      book  predatory dinosaurs of the world   the freelance dinosaurologist gregory paul proposed that  a  fragilis  had tall pointed horns and a slender build compared to a postulated second species  a  atrox   and was not a different gender due to rarity   allosaurus atrox  was originally named by marsh in      as the type species of its own genus   creosaurus   and is based on ypm       an assortment of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull  portions of nine tail vertebrae  two hip vertebrae  an illium  and ankle and foot bones  although the idea of two common morrison allosaur species was followed in some semi technical and popular works  the      thesis on allosauridae noted that charles gilmore mistakenly reconstructed usnm      as having a shorter skull than the specimens referred by paul to  atrox   refuting supposed differences between usnm      and putative  a  atrox  specimens like dino       amnh      and amnh     

 allosaurus agilis   seen in zittel        and osborn        is a typographical error for  a  fragilis    allosaurus ferox  is a typographical error by marsh for  a  fragilis  in a figure caption for the partial skull ypm       and ypm      has been treated as a specimen of  a fragilis   likewise   labrosaurus fragilis  is a typographical error by marsh        for  labrosaurus ferox    a  whitei  is a nomen nudum coined by pickering in      for the complete  allosaurus  specimens that paul referred to  a  atrox  

several species initially classified within or referred to  allosaurus  do not belong within the genus   a  medius  was named by marsh in      for various specimens from the early cretaceous arundel formation of maryland  although most of the remains were removed by richard swann lull to the new ornithopod species  dryosaurus grandis   except for a tooth  gilmore considered the tooth nondiagnostic but transferred it to  dryptosaurus   as  d  medius   the referral was not accepted in the most recent review  and  allosaurus medius  was simply listed as a dubious species of theropod  it may be closely related to  acrocanthosaurus  

 allosaurus valens  is a new combination for  antrodemus valens  used by friedrich von huene in        antrodemus valens  itself may also pertain to  allosaurus fragilis   as gilmore suggested in      

 a  lucaris   another marsh name  was given to a partial skeleton in       he later decided it warranted its own genus   labrosaurus   but this has not been accepted  and  a  lucaris  is also regarded as another specimen of  a  fragilis    allosaurus lucaris   is known mostly from vertebrae  sharing characters with  allosaurus   paul and carpenter stated that the type specimen of this species  ypm       was from a younger age than  allosaurus   and might represent a different genus  however  they found that the specimen was undiagnostic  and thus  a  lucaris  was a  nomen dubium  

 allosaurus sibiricus  was described in      by a  n  riabinin on the basis of a bone  later identified as a partial fourth metatarsal  from the early cretaceous of buryatia  russia  it was transferred to  chilantaisaurus  in       but is now considered a  nomen dubium  indeterminate beyond theropoda 

 allosaurus meriani  was a new combination by george olshevsky for  megalosaurus meriani  greppin        based on a tooth from the late jurassic of switzerland  however  a recent overview of  ceratosaurus  included it in  ceratosaurus  sp 

 apatodon mirus   based on a scrap of vertebra marsh first thought to be a mammalian jaw  has been listed as a synonym of  allosaurus fragilis   however  it was considered indeterminate beyond dinosauria by dan chure  and mickey mortimer believes that the synonymy of  apatodon  with  allosaurus  was due to correspondence to ralph molnar by john mcintosh  whereby the latter reportedly found a paper saying that othniel charles marsh admitted that the  apatodon  holotype was actually an allosaurid dorsal vertebra 

 a  amplexus  was named by gregory s  paul for giant morrison allosaur remains  and included in his conception  saurophagus maximus   later  saurophaganax     a  amplexus  was originally coined by cope in      as the type species of his new genus  epanterias   and is based on what is now amnh       parts of three vertebrae  a coracoid  and a metatarsal  following paul s work  this species has been accepted as a synonym of  a  fragilis   a      study by paul and kenneth carpenter  however  indicates that  epanterias  is temporally younger than the  a  fragilis  type specimen  so is a separate species at minimum 

 a  maximus  was a new combination by david k  smith for chure s  saurophaganax maximus   a taxon created by chure in      for giant allosaurid remains from the morrison of oklahoma  these remains had been known as  saurophagus   but that name was already in use  leading chure to propose a substitute  smith  in his      analysis of variation  concluded that  s  maximus  was not different enough from  allosaurus  to be a separate genus  but did warrant its own species   a  maximus   this reassignment was rejected in the most recent review of basal tetanurans 

there are also several species left over from the synonymizations of  creosaurus  and  labrosaurus  with  allosaurus    creosaurus potens  was named by lull in      for a vertebra from the early cretaceous of maryland  it is now regarded as a dubious theropod   labrosaurus stechowi   described in      by janensch based on isolated  ceratosaurus  like teeth from the tendaguru beds of tanzania  although donald f  glut listed it as a species of  allosaurus   it is now considered a dubious ceratosaurian related to  ceratosaurus    l  sulcatus   named by marsh in      for a morrison theropod tooth  which like  l  stechowi  is now regarded as a dubious  ceratosaurus  like ceratosaur 

 a  tendagurensis  was named in      by werner janensch for a partial shin  mb r       found in the kimmeridgian age tendaguru formation in mtwara  tanzania  although tabulated as a tentatively valid species of  allosaurus  in the second edition of the dinosauria  subsequent studies place it as indeterminate beyond tetanurae  either a carcharodontosaurian or megalosaurid  although obscure  it was a large theropod  possibly around     meters long      ft  and      metric tons       short tons  in weight 

kurzanov and colleagues in      designated six teeth from siberia as  allosaurus  sp   meaning the authors found the specimens to be most like those of  allosaurus   but did not or could not assign a species   also  reports of  allosaurus  in shanxi  china go back to at least      

an astragalus  ankle bone  thought to belong to a species of  allosaurus  was found at cape paterson  victoria in early cretaceous beds in southeastern australia  it was thought to provide evidence that australia was a refugium for animals that had gone extinct elsewhere  this identification was challenged by samuel welles  who thought it more resembled that of an ornithomimid  but the original authors defended their identification  with fifteen years of new specimens and research to look at  daniel chure reexamined the bone and found that it was not  allosaurus   but could represent an allosauroid  similarly  yoichi azuma and phil currie  in their description of  fukuiraptor   noted that the bone closely resembled that of their new genus  this specimen is sometimes referred to as  allosaurus robustus   an informal museum name  it may have belonged to something similar to  or the same as   australovenator   or it may represent an abelisaur 

 allosaurus  was an allosaurid  a member of a family of large theropods within the larger group carnosauria  the family name allosauridae was created for this genus in      by othniel charles marsh  but the term was largely unused until the     s in favor of megalosauridae  another family of large theropods that eventually became a wastebasket taxon  this  along with the use of  antrodemus  for  allosaurus  during the same period  is a point that needs to be remembered when searching for information on  allosaurus  in publications that predate james madsen s      monograph  major publications using the name  megalosauridae  instead of  allosauridae  include gilmore        von huene        romer       and       steel        and walker       

following the publication of madsen s influential monograph  allosauridae became the preferred family assignment  but it too was not strongly defined  semi technical works used allosauridae for a variety of large theropods  usually those that were larger and better known than megalosaurids  typical theropods that were thought to be related to  allosaurus  included  indosaurus    piatnitzkysaurus    piveteausaurus    yangchuanosaurus    acrocanthosaurus    chilantaisaurus    compsosuchus    stokesosaurus   and  szechuanosaurus   given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of evolutionary relationships  none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid  although several  like  acrocanthosaurus  and  yangchuanosaurus   are members of closely related families 
below is a cladogram by benson  et al   in      

allosauridae is one of four families in carnosauria  the other three are neovenatoridae  carcharodontosauridae and sinraptoridae  allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the tyrannosauridae  which would make it paraphyletic   one recent example being gregory s  paul s  predatory dinosaurs of the world   but this has been rejected  with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods  the coelurosauria  allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families  with only  saurophaganax  and a currently unnamed french allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides  allosaurus  in the most recent review  another genus   epanterias   is a potential valid member  but it and  saurophaganax  may turn out to be large examples of  allosaurus   recent reviews have kept the genus  saurophaganax  and included  epanterias  with  allosaurus  

the wealth of  allosaurus  fossils  from nearly all ages of individuals  allows scientists to study how the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been  remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as eggs   crushed eggs from colorado have been suggested as those of  allosaurus   based on histological analysis of limb bones  bone deposition appears to stop at around    to     years  which is comparable to that of other large theropods like  tyrannosaurus   from the same analysis  its maximum growth appears to have been at age      with an estimated growth rate of about      kilograms       lb  per year 

medullary bone tissue  endosteally derived  ephemeral  mineralization located inside the medulla of the long bones in gravid female birds  has been reported in at least one  allosaurus  specimen  a shin bone from the cleveland lloyd quarry  today  this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs  as it is used to supply calcium to shells  its presence in the  allosaurus  individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age  however  other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs  including this  allosaurus  individual  data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this  allosaurus  individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead  however  with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of  tyrannosaurus   it may be possible to ascertain whether or not the  allosaurus  in question was indeed female 
the discovery of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles  and the lower segments of the leg  shin and foot  were relatively longer than the thigh  these differences suggest that younger  allosaurus  were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults  perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles  then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood  the thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth  and the cross section less circular  as muscle attachments shifted  muscles became shorter  and the growth of the leg slowed  these changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults  which would have moved with more regular forward progression  conversely  the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically  increasing in size without changing in proportion 

paleontologists accept  allosaurus  as an active predator of large animals  there is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on  stegosaurus   including an  allosaurus  tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a  stegosaurus  tail spike  and a  stegosaurus  neck plate with a u shaped wound that correlates well with an  allosaurus  snout  sauropods seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of scavenging  based on the presence of scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones  however  as gregory paul noted in        allosaurus  was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods  unless it hunted in packs  as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth  and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods  another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults  research in the     s and first decade of the   st century may have found other solutions to this question  robert t  bakker  comparing  allosaurus  to cenozoic sabre toothed carnivorous mammals  found similar adaptations  such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles  and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide  although  allosaurus  did not have sabre teeth  bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations  the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a saw like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw  which would have been driven into prey  this type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey  with the goal of weakening the victim 

similar conclusions were drawn by another study using finite element analysis on an  allosaurus  skull  according to their biomechanical analysis  the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force  by using jaw muscles only  it could produce a bite force of     to        n  but the skull could withstand nearly         n of vertical force against the tooth row  the authors suggested that  allosaurus  used its skull like a machete against prey  attacking open mouthed  slashing flesh with its teeth  and tearing it away without splintering bones  unlike  tyrannosaurus   which is thought to have been capable of damaging bones  they also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey  the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods  but strong enough for high impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods  their interpretations were challenged by other researchers  who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey  the original authors noted that  allosaurus  itself has no modern equivalent  that the tooth row is well suited to such an attack  and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the palate and lessen stress  another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like  allosaurus  were  flesh grazers  which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright  this strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later  an additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey  and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats  grasping the prey with their forelimbs  and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea  this is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey  studies done by stephen lautenschager  et al   from the university of bristol also indicate  allosaurus  could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force  when compared with  tyrannosaurus  and the therizinosaurid  erlikosaurus  in the same study  it was found that  allosaurus  had a wider gape than either  the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a    degree angle at maximum  the findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs  like modern carnivores  had wider jaw gapes than herbivores 

a biomechanical study published in      by eric snively and colleagues found that  allosaurus  had an unusually low attachment point on the skull for the longissimus capitis superficialis neck muscle compared to other theropods such as  tyrannosaurus   this would have allowed the animal to make rapid and forceful vertical movements with the skull  the authors found that vertical strikes as proposed by bakker and rayfield are consistent with the animal s capabilities  they also found that the animal probably processed carcasses by vertical movements in a similar manner to falcons  such as kestrels  the animal could have gripped prey with the skull and feet  then pulled back and up to remove flesh  this differs from the prey handling envisioned for tyrannosaurids  which probably tore flesh with lateral shakes of the skull  similar to crocodilians  in addition   allosaurus  was able to  move its head and neck around relatively rapidly and with considerable control   at the cost of power 

other aspects of feeding include the eyes  arms  and legs  the shape of the skull of  allosaurus  limited potential binocular vision to      of width  slightly less than that of modern crocodilians  as with crocodilians  this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks  the arms  compared with those of other theropods  were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close  and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things  finally  the top speed of  allosaurus  has been estimated at    to     kilometers per hour     to     miles per hour  

a new paper on the cranio dental morphology of  allosaurus  and how it worked has deemed the hatchet jaw attack unlikely  reinterpreting the unusually wide gape as an adaptation to allow allosaurus to deliver a muscle driven bite to large prey  with the weaker jaw muscles being a trade off to allow for the widened gape 

it has been speculated since the     s that  allosaurus  preyed on sauropods and other large dinosaurs by hunting in groups 
such a depiction is common in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature  robert t  bakker has extended social behavior to parental care  and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown  and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food  however  there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods  and social interactions with members of the same species would have included antagonistic encounters  as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls  the pathologic lower jaw named  labrosaurus ferox  is one such possible example   such head biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes 

although  allosaurus  may have hunted in packs  it has been argued that  allosaurus  and other theropods had largely aggressive interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species  the study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator  as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs  is rare among vertebrates in general  and modern diapsid carnivores  including lizards  crocodiles  and birds  rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way  instead  they are typically territorial and will kill and cannibalize intruders of the same species  and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites  according to this interpretation  the accumulation of remains of multiple  allosaurus  individuals at the same site  e g  in the cleveland   lloyd quarry  are not due to pack hunting  but to the fact that  allosaurus  individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs  and were sometimes killed in the process  this could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present  as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like crocodiles and komodo dragons  the same interpretation applies to bakker s lair sites  there is some evidence for cannibalism in  allosaurus   including  allosaurus  shed teeth found among rib fragments  possible tooth marks on a shoulder blade  and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at bakker s lair sites 

the brain of  allosaurus   as interpreted from spiral ct scanning of an endocast  was more consistent with crocodilian brains than those of the other living archosaurs  birds  the structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal  as opposed to strongly tipped up or down  the structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian  and so  allosaurus  probably could have heard lower frequencies best  and would have had trouble with subtle sounds  the olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors  although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small 

in       bruce rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior  since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury  stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or migration  resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand   allosaurus  was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion  and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb  when the researchers looked for stress fractures  they found that  allosaurus  had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than  albertosaurus    ornithomimus  or  archaeornithomimus   of the    hand bones the researchers studied    were found to contain stress fractures  of the feet      bones were studied and    found to have stress fractures  the stress fractures in the foot bones  were distributed to the proximal phalanges  and occurred across all three weight bearing toes in  statistically indistinguishable  numbers  since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress  if the allosaurs  stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others  the lack of such a bias in the examined  allosaurus  fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running  the authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey  like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet  the abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in  allosaurus  provide evidence for  very active  predation based rather than scavenging diets 

the left scapula and fibula of an  allosaurus fragilis  specimen catalogued as usnm      are both pathological  both probably due to healed fractures  the specimen usnm      preserved several pathological gastralia which preserve evidence of healed fractures near their middle  some of the fractures were poorly healed and  formed pseudoarthroses   a specimen with a fractured rib was recovered from the cleveland lloyd quarry  another specimen had fractured ribs and fused vertebrae near the end of the tail  an apparent subadult male  allosaurus fragilis  was reported to have extensive pathologies  with a total of fourteen separate injuries  the specimen mor     had pathologies on five ribs  the sixth neck vertebra the third eighth and thirteenth back vertebrae  the second tail vertebra and its chevron  the gastralia right scapula  manual phalanx i left ilium metatarsals iii and v  the first phalanx of the third toe and the third phalanx of the second  the ilium had  a large hole    caused by a blow from above  the near end of the first phalanx of the third toe was afflicted by an involucrum 

other pathologies reported in  allosaurus  include  willow breaks in two ribs  healed fractures in the humerus and radius  distortion of joint surfaces in the foot possibly due to osteoarthritis or developmental issues  osteopetrosis along the endosteal surface of a tibia  distortions of the joint surfaces of the tail vertebrae possibly due to osetoarthritis or developmental issues    e xtensive  neoplastic  ankylosis of caudals   possibly due to physical trauma as well as the fusion of chevrons to centra  coossification of vertebral centra near the end of the tail  amputation of a chevron and foot bone  both possibly a result of bites    e xtensive exostoses  in the first phalanx of the third toe  lesions similar to those caused by osteomyelitis in two scapulae  bone spurs in a premaxilla  ungual  and two metacarpals  exostosis in a pedal phalanx possibly attributable to an infectious disease  a metacarpal with a round depressed fracture 

 allosaurus  was the most common large theropod in the vast tract of western american fossil bearing rock known as the morrison formation  accounting for    to     of theropod specimens  and as such was at the top trophic level of the morrison food web  the morrison formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons  and flat floodplains  vegetation varied from river lining forests of conifers  tree ferns  and ferns  gallery forests   to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the  araucaria  like conifer  brachyphyllum  

the morrison formation has been a rich fossil hunting ground  the flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae  fungi  mosses  horsetails  ferns  cycads  ginkgoes  and several families of conifers  animal fossils discovered include bivalves  snails  ray finned fishes  frogs  salamanders  turtles  sphenodonts  lizards  terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans  several species of pterosaur  numerous dinosaur species  and early mammals such as docodonts  multituberculates  symmetrodonts  and triconodonts  dinosaurs known from the morrison include the theropods  ceratosaurus    ornitholestes    tanycolagreus   and  torvosaurus   the sauropods  haplocanthosaurus    camarasaurus    cathetosaurus    brachiosaurus    suuwassea    apatosaurus    brontosaurus    barosaurus    diplodocus    supersaurus   and  amphicoelias   and the ornithischians  camptosaurus    dryosaurus   and  stegosaurus    allosaurus  is commonly found at the same sites as  apatosaurus    camarasaurus    diplodocus   and  stegosaurus   the late jurassic formations of portugal where  allosaurus  is present are interpreted as having been similar to the morrison but with a stronger marine influence  many of the dinosaurs of the morrison formation are the same genera as those seen in portuguese rocks  mainly  allosaurus    ceratosaurus    torvosaurus   and  stegosaurus    or have a close counterpart   brachiosaurus  and  lusotitan    camptosaurus  and  draconyx   

 allosaurus  coexisted with fellow large theropods  ceratosaurus  and  torvosaurus  in both the united states and portugal  the three appear to have had different ecological niches  based on anatomy and the location of fossils  ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways  and had lower  thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains  whereas allosaurs were more compact  with longer legs  faster but less maneuverable  and seem to have preferred dry floodplains   ceratosaurus   better known than  torvosaurus   differed noticeably from  allosaurus  in functional anatomy by having a taller  narrower skull with large  broad teeth   allosaurus  was itself a potential food item to other carnivores  as illustrated by an  allosaurus  pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod  probably  ceratosaurus  or  torvosaurus   the location of the bone in the body  along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs   and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton  indicates that the  allosaurus  was being scavenged 





ak   

the ak     ak  or as it is officially known     also known as the kalashnikov  is a gas operated          mm assault rifle  developed in the soviet union by mikhail kalashnikov  it is the originating firearm of the kalashnikov rifle  or  ak   family 

design work on the ak    began in       in       the ak    was presented for official military trials  and in       the fixed stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the soviet army  an early development of the design was the  aks   s    skladnoy  or  folding    which was equipped with an underfolding metal shoulder stock  in early       the ak    was officially accepted by the soviet armed forces and used by the majority of the member states of the warsaw pact 

even after almost seven decades  the model and its variants remain the most popular and widely used assault rifles in the world because of their substantial reliability under harsh conditions  low production costs compared to contemporary western weapons  availability in virtually every geographic region and ease of use  the ak    has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces and insurgencies worldwide  and was the basis for developing many other types of individual  crew served and specialised firearms     of the estimated     million firearms worldwide  approximately     million belong to the kalashnikov family  three quarters of which are ak   s  

during world war ii  the sturmgewehr    assault rifle used by german forces made a deep impression on their soviet counterparts  the select fire rifle was chambered for a new intermediate cartridge  the         mm kurz  and combined the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a rifle  on    july       an earlier model of the sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the people s commissariat of arms of the ussr  the soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own  to replace the ppsh    submachine guns and outdated mosin   nagant bolt action rifles that armed most of the soviet army 

the soviets soon developed the         mm m   cartridge  the semi automatic sks carbine and the rpd light machine gun  shortly after world war ii  the soviets developed the ak    assault rifle  which would quickly replace the sks in soviet service  introduced in       the akm is a lighter stamped steel version and the most ubiquitous variant of the entire ak series of firearms  in the     s  the soviets introduced the rpk light machine gun  an ak type weapon with a stronger receiver  a longer heavy barrel  and a bipod  that would eventually replace the rpd light machine gun 

mikhail kalashnikov began his career as a weapon designer in       while recuperating from a shoulder wound which he received during the battle of bryansk  kalashnikov himself stated    i was in the hospital  and a soldier in the bed beside me asked   why do our soldiers have only one rifle for two or three of our men  when the germans have automatics   so i designed one  i was a soldier  and i created a machine gun for a soldier  it was called an avtomat kalashnikova  the automatic weapon of kalashnikov   ak   and it carried the date of its first manufacture        

the ak    is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations   kalashnikov decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the american m  and the german stg     kalashnikov s team had access to these weapons and had no need to  reinvent the wheel   kalashnikov himself observed   a lot of russian army soldiers ask me how one can become a constructor  and how new weaponry is designed  these are very difficult questions  each designer seems to have his own paths  his own successes and failures  but one thing is clear  before attempting to create something new  it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field  i myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so  

there are claims about kalashnikov copying other designs  like bulkin s tkb     or simonov s avs    

kalashnikov started work on a submachine gun design in      and with a light machine gun in        early in       kalashnikov was given some         mm m   cartridges and informed that there were several designers working on weapons for this new soviet small arms cartridge  it was suggested to him that this new weapon might well lead to greater things  and he undertook work on the new rifle   in       he entered a design competition with this new         mm  semi automatic  gas operated  long stroke piston  carbine  strongly influenced by the american m  garand   the rifle that kalashnikov designed was in the same class as the familiar sks    simonov with fixed magazine and gas tube above the barrel   however  this new kalashnikov design lost out to a simonov design 

in       a new design competition was initiated to develop a new assault rifle  kalashnikov submitted an entry  it was gas operated rifle with a short stroke gas piston above the barrel  a breech block mechanism similar to his      carbine  and a curved    round magazine  kalashnikov s rifles ak    with a milled receiver  and ak    with a stamped receiver  proved to be reliable weapons and were accepted to a second round of competition along with other designs 

these prototypes  also known as the ak     had a rotary bolt  a two part receiver with separate trigger unit housing  dual controls  separate safety and fire selector switches  and a non reciprocating charging handle located on the left side of the weapon  this design had many similarities to the stg     in late       as the rifles were being tested  one of kalashnikov s assistants  aleksandr zaitsev  suggested a major redesign to improve reliability  at first  kalashnikov was reluctant  given that their rifle had already fared better than its competitors  eventually  however  zaitsev managed to persuade kalashnikov 

in november       the new prototypes  ak   s  were completed  it utilized a long stroke gas piston above the barrel  the upper and lower receivers were combined into a single receiver  the selector and safety were combined into a single control lever dust cover on the right side of the rifle  and  the bolt handle was simply attached to the bolt carrier  this simplified the design and production of the rifle  the first army trial series began in early       the new rifle proved to be reliable under a wide range of conditions with convenient handling characteristics  in       it was adopted by the soviet army as        mm kalashnikov assault rifle  ak   

there were many difficulties during the initial phase of production  the first production models had stamped sheet metal receivers with a milled trunnion and butt stock insert  and a stamped body  difficulties were encountered in welding the guide and ejector rails  causing high rejection rates  instead of halting production  a heavy machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver  even though production of these milled rifles started in       they were officially referred to as ak     based on the date their development started  but they are much widely known in the collectors  and current commercial market as  type   ak      this was a more costly process  but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier mosin   nagant rifle s machined receiver were easily adapted  partly because of these problems  the soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until       during this time  production of the interim sks rifle continued 

once the manufacturing difficulties of non milled receivers had been overcome  a redesigned version designated the akm  m for  modernized  or  upgraded   in russian                                                                             avtomat kalashnikova modernizirovanniy    was introduced in       this new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted muzzle brake on the end of the barrel to compensate for muzzle rise under recoil  in addition  a hammer retarder was added to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery  without the bolt being fully closed   during rapid or fully automatic fire  this is also sometimes referred to as a  cyclic rate reducer   or simply  rate reducer   as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during fully automatic fire  it was also roughly one third lighter than the previous model 

both licensed and unlicensed production of the kalashnikov weapons abroad were almost exclusively of the akm variant  partially due to the much easier production of the stamped receiver  this model is the most commonly encountered  having been produced in much greater quantities  all rifles based on the kalashnikov design are frequently referred to as ak   s in the west  although this is only correct when applied to rifles based on the original three receiver types  in most former eastern bloc countries  the weapon is known simply as the  kalashnikov  or  ak   the differences between the milled and stamped receivers includes the use of rivets rather than welds on the stamped receiver  as well as the placement of a small dimple above the magazine well for stabilization of the magazine 

in       the soviets began replacing their ak    and akm rifles with a newer design  the ak     which uses         mm ammunition  this new rifle and cartridge had only started to be manufactured in eastern european nations when the soviet union collapsed  drastically slowing production of the ak    and other weapons of the former soviet bloc 

the ak    was designed to be a simple  reliable fully automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply  using mass production methods that were state of the art in the soviet union during the late     s  the ak    uses a long stroke gas system that is generally associated with great reliability in adverse conditions  the large gas piston  generous clearances between moving parts  and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle 

the ak fires the         mm cartridge with a muzzle velocity of  
the cartridge weight is   the projectile weight is   the original soviet m   bullets are     grain boat tail bullets with a copper plated steel jacket  a large steel core  and some lead between the core and the jacket  the ak has excellent penetration when shooting through heavy foliage  walls or a common vehicle s metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover  the         mm m   projectile does not generally fragment when striking an opponent and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone  the         mm round produces significant wounding in cases where the bullet tumbles  yaws  in tissue  but produces relatively minor wounds in cases where the bullet exits before beginning to yaw  in the absence of yaw  the m   round can pencil through tissue with relatively little injury 

most  if not all  of the         mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded m   variety  this variety deleted the steel insert  shifting the center of gravity rearward  and allowing the projectile to destabilize  or yaw  at about   nearly earlier in tissue than the m   round  this change also reduces penetration in ballistic gelatin to   for the newer m   round versus   for the older m   round  however  the wounding potential of m   is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes  especially when the bullet yaws 

to fire  the operator inserts a loaded magazine  pulls back and releases the charging handle  and then pulls the trigger  in semi automatic  the firearm fires only once  requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot  in fully automatic  the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger  after ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant  rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle  the build up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long stroke piston and bolt carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier  along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide  rotates the bolt approximately      and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt  the moving assembly has about of free travel  which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence  allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken  the ak    does not have a gas valve  excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder  the kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation  but uses an extractor claw to eject the spent cartridge case 

the rifle received a barrel with a chrome lined bore and four right hand grooves at a      mm    in      in  rifling twist rate  the gas block contains a gas channel that is installed at a slanted angle in relation to the bore axis  the muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a muzzle brake or a blank firing adaptor 

the gas block of the ak    features a cleaning rod capture or sling loop  gas relief ports that alleviate gas pressure are placed horizontally in a row on the gas cylinder 

the fire selector is a large lever located on the right side of the rifle  it acts as a dust cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe  it is operated by the shooter s right fore fingers and has   settings  safe  up   full auto  center   and semi auto  down   the reason for this is that under stress a soldier will push the selector lever down with considerable force bypassing the full auto stage and setting the rifle to semi auto  to set the ak    to full auto requires the deliberate action of centering the selector lever  to operate the fire selector lever  right handed shooters have to briefly remove their right hand from the pistol grip  which is ergonomically sub optimal  some ak type rifles also have a more traditional selector lever on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip  this lever is operated by the shooter s right thumb and has three settings  safe  forward   full auto  center   and semi auto  backward  

the ak    uses a notched rear tangent iron sight calibrated in increments from   the front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field  horizontal adjustment requires a special drift tool and is done by the armory before issue or if the need arises by an armorer after issue  the sight line elements are approximately over the bore axis  the  point blank range  battle zero setting      standing for                      on   constant  on the         mm ak    rear tangent sight element corresponds to a zero  these settings mirror the mosin   nagant and sks rifles  which the ak    replaced  for the ak    combined with service cartridges  the     m battle zero setting limits the apparent  bullet rise  within approximately relative to the line of sight  soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass  the belt buckle  according to russian and former soviet doctrine  of the enemy target  any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant  as a well aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier  some ak type rifles have a front sight with a flip up luminous dot that is calibrated at   for improved night fighting 

the ak    was originally equipped with a buttstock  handguard and an upper heat guard made from solid wood  with the introduction of the type   receiver the buttstock  lower handguard and upper heatguard were manufactured from birch plywood laminates  such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping better than the conventional one piece patterns  do not require lengthy maturing  and are cheaper  the wooden furniture was finished with the russian amber shellac finishing process  aks and akms models featured a downward folding metal butt stock similar to that of the german mp   submachine gun  for use in the restricted space in the bmp infantry combat vehicle  as well as by paratroops  all     series aks use plastic furniture with side folding stocks 

the standard magazine capacity is    rounds  there are also         and    round box magazines  as well as    round drum magazines 

the ak    s standard    round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber  their heavy steel construction combined with  feed lips   the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber  machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage  these magazines are so strong that  soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers  and even bottle openers   this contributes to the ak    magazine being more reliable  but makes it heavier than u s  and nato magazines 

the early slab sided steel ak       round detachable box magazines had sheet metal bodies and weigh empty  the later steel akm    round magazines had lighter sheet metal bodies with prominent reinforcing ribs weighing empty  to further reduce weight  a light weight magazine with an aluminum body with a prominent reinforcing waffle rib pattern weighing empty was developed for the akm that proved to be too fragile and the small issued amount of these magazines were quickly withdrawn from service  as a replacement steel reinforced    round plastic         mm box magazines were introduced  these rust colored magazines weigh empty and are often mistakenly identified as being made of bakelite  a phenolic resin   but were actually fabricated from two parts of ag s  molding compound  a glass reinforced phenol formaldehyde binder impregnated composite   assembled using an epoxy resin adhesive  noted for their durability  these magazines did however compromise the rifle s camouflage and lacked the small horizontal reinforcing ribs running down both sides of the magazine body near the front that were added on all later plastic magazine generations  a second generation steel reinforced dark brown  color shades vary from maroon to plum to near black     round         mm magazine was introduced in the early     s  fabricated from abs plastic  the third generation steel reinforced    round         mm magazine is similar to the second generation  but is darker colored and has a matte nonreflective surface finish  the current issue steel reinforced matte true black nonreflective surface finished         mm    round magazines  fabricated from abs plastic weigh empty 

early steel ak    magazines are long  the later ribbed steel akm and newer plastic         mm magazines are about shorter 

the transition from steel to mainly plastic magazines yields a significant weight reduction and allows a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight 

all         mm ak magazines are backwards compatible with older ak variants 

       kg        lb  is the maximum amount of ammo that the average soldier can comfortably carry  it also allows for best comparison of the three most common         mm ak magazines 

most yugoslavian and some east german ak magazines were made with cartridge followers that hold the bolt open when empty  however  most ak magazine followers allow the bolt to close when the magazine is empty 

accessories supplied with the rifle include a long  h  bayonet featuring a long spear point blade  the ak    bayonet is installed by slipping the diameter muzzle ring around the muzzle and latching the handle down on the bayonet lug under the front sight base 

all current model akm rifles can mount under barrel     mm grenade launchers such as the gp    and its variants  which can fire up to    rounds per minute and have an effective range of up to     metres  the main grenade is the vog     vog   m  fragmentation grenade which has a    m     m       ft      ft   lethality radius  the vog   p vog   pm   jumping   variant explodes above the ground 

the ak    can also mount a  rarely used  cup type grenade launcher  the kalashnikov grenade launcher that fires standard rgd   soviet hand grenades  the maximum effective range is approximately     meters  this launcher can also be used to launch tear gas and riot control grenades 

all current aks      series  and some older models  have side rails for mounting a variety of scopes and sighting devices  such as the pso   optical sniper sight  the side rails allow for the removal and remounting of optical accessories without interfering with the zeroing of the optic  however  the     series side folding stocks cannot be folded with the optics mounted 

the ak    and its variants have been and are made in dozens of countries  with  quality ranging from finely engineered weapons to pieces of questionable workmanship   as a result  the ak    has a service system life of approximately        to         to        rounds  the ak    was designed to be a cheap  simple  easy to manufacture assault rifle  perfectly matching soviet military doctrine that treats equipment and weapons as disposable items  as units are often deployed without adequate logistical support and dependent on  battlefield cannibalization  for resupply  it is actually more cost effective to replace rather than repair weapons 

the ak    has small parts and springs that need to be replaced every few thousand rounds  however   every time it is disassembled beyond the field stripping stage  it will take some time for some parts to regain their fit  some parts may tend to shake loose and fall out when firing the weapon  some parts of the ak    line are riveted together  repairing these can be quite a hassle  since the end of the rivet has to be ground off and a new one set after the part is replaced

manufacturing countries of ak    and its variants in alphabetical order 
a private company kalashnikov concern  formerly izhmash  from russia has repeatedly claimed that the majority of foreign manufacturers are producing ak type rifles without proper licensing 

the ak    s accuracy has always been considered to be  good enough  to hit an adult male torso out to about   though even experts firing from prone or bench rest positions at this range were observed to have difficulty placing ten consecutive rounds on target  later designs did not significantly improve its accuracy  an ak can fire a    shot group of at   and at the newer stamped steel receiver akm models  while more rugged and less prone to metal fatigue  are actually less accurate than the forged milled receivers of their predecessors  the milled ak   s are capable of shooting groups at   whereas the stamped akms are capable of shooting groups at  

the best shooters are able to hit a man sized target at within five shots  firing from prone or bench rest position  or ten shots  standing  

the single shot hit probability on the nato e type silhouette target  a human upper body half and head silhouette  of the ak    and the later developed ak     m  a  and m  a  assault rifles were measured by the us military under ideal proving ground conditions in the     s as follows 

the following table represents the russian method for determining accuracy  which is far more complex than western methods  in the west  one fires a group of shots into the target and then simply measures the overall diameter of the group  the russians  on the other hand  fire a group of shots into the target  they then draw two circles on the target  one for the maximum vertical dispersion of hits and one for the maximum horizontal dispersion of hits  they then disregard the hits on the outer part of the target and only count half of the hits      or r  on the inner part of the circles  this dramatically reduces the overall diameter of the groups  they then use both the vertical and horizontal measurements of the reduced groups to measure accuracy  this circular error probable method used by the russians and other european militaries cannot be converted and is not comparable to us military methods for determining rifle accuracy  when the r results are doubled the hit probability increases to       

the vertical and horizontal mean  r  deviations with service ammunition at for ak platforms are 


throughout the world  the ak and its variants are commonly used by governments  revolutionaries  terrorists  criminals  and civilians alike  in some countries  such as somalia  rwanda  mozambique  congo and tanzania  the prices for black market aks are between     and      per weapon and prices have fallen in the last few decades due to mass counterfeiting  in kenya   an ak    fetches five head of cattle  about        kenya shillings or     u s  dollars  when offered for barter  but costs almost half that price when cash is paid   there are places around the world where ak type weapons can be purchased on the black market  for as little as     or traded for a chicken or a sack of grain  

the ak    has also spawned a cottage industry of sorts and has been copied and manufactured  one gun at a time  in small shops around the world  see khyber pass copy   the estimated numbers of ak type weapons vary greatly  the small arms survey suggest that  between    and      million of these weapons have been produced since        the world bank estimates that out of the      million total firearms available worldwide       million are of the kalashnikov family  and     million are ak   s  because ak type weapons have been made in many countries  often illicitly  it is impossible to know how many really exist 

the ak    has been used in the following conflicts 


during the cold war  the soviet union and the people s republic of china  as well as united states and other nato nations supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries and rebel forces around the world  during this time the western countries used relatively expensive automatic rifles  such as the fn fal  the hk g   the m    and the m    in contrast  the russians and chinese used the ak     its low production cost and ease of manufacture allow them to make aks in vast numbers 

in the pro communist states  the ak    became a symbol of the third world revolution  they were utilized in the cambodian civil war and the cambodian   vietnamese war  during the     s  the soviet union became the principal arms dealer to countries embargoed by western nations  including middle eastern nations such as iran  libya  and syria  which welcomed soviet union backing against israel  after the fall of the soviet union  ak   s were sold both openly and on the black market to any group with cash  including drug cartels and dictatorial states  and more recently they have been seen in the hands of islamic groups such as al qaeda  isil  and the taliban in afghanistan and iraq  and farc  ej  rcito de liberaci  n nacional guerrillas in colombia 

in russia  the kalashnikov is a tremendous source of national pride   the family of the inventor of the world s most famous assault rifle  mikhail kalashnikov  has authorized german engineering company mmi to use the well known kalashnikov name on a variety of not so deadly goods   in recent years  kalashnikov vodka has been marketed with souvenir bottles in the shape of the ak    kalashnikov  there are also kalashnikov watches  umbrellas  and knives 

the kalashnikov museum  also called the ak    museum  opened on   november      in izhevsk  udmurt republic  this city is in the ural region of russia  the museum chronicles the biography of general kalashnikov and documents the invention of the ak     the museum complex of kalashnikov s small arms  a series of halls  and multimedia exhibitions are devoted to the evolution of the ak    assault rifle and attracts        monthly visitors  nadezhda vechtomova  the museum director  stated in an interview that the purpose of the museum is to honor the ingenuity of the inventor and the hard work of the employees and to  separate the weapon as a weapon of murder from the people who are producing it and to tell its history in our country   on    september      a monument of kalashnikov was unveiled in central moscow  a protester  later detained by police  attempted to unfurl a banner reading  a creator of weapons is a creator of death  

the proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers  the ak    is included in the flag of mozambique and its emblem  an acknowledgment that the country gained its independence in large part through the effective use of their ak   s  it is also found in the coats of arms of east timor and the revolution era burkina faso  as well as in the flags of hezbollah  syrian resistance  farc ep  the new people s army  tkp tikko and the international revolutionary people s guerrilla forces 

some western countries associate the ak    with their enemies  both cold war era and present day  for example  western movies often portray criminals  gang members and terrorists using ak   s  for these reasons  in the u s  and western europe  the ak    is stereotypically regarded as the weapon of choice of insurgents  gangsters and terrorists  conversely  throughout the developing world  the ak    can be positively attributed with revolutionaries against foreign occupation  imperialism  or colonialism 

the ak    made an appearance in u s  popular culture as a recurring focus in the nicolas cage film  lord of war          numerous monologues in the movie focus on the weapon  and its effects on global conflict and the gun running market 

in       the colombian musician and peace activist c  sar l  pez devised the  escopetarra   an ak converted into a guitar  one sold for us        in a fundraiser held to benefit the victims of anti personnel mines  while another was exhibited at the united nations  conference on disarmament 

in mexico  the ak    is known as  cuerno de chivo   literally  goat s horn   because of its curved magazine design  it is one of the weapons of choice of mexican drug cartels  it is sometimes mentioned in mexican folk music lyrics 







atanasoff   berry computer

the atanasoff   berry computer  abc  was the first automatic electronic digital computer  an early electronic digital computing device that has remained somewhat obscure  the abc s priority is debated among historians of computer technology  because it was neither programmable  nor turing complete 

conceived in       the machine was built by iowa state college mathematics and physics professor john vincent atanasoff with the help of graduate student clifford berry  it was designed only to solve systems of linear equations and was successfully tested in       however  its intermediate result storage mechanism  a paper card writer reader  was not perfected  and when john vincent atanasoff left iowa state college for world war ii assignments  work on the machine was discontinued  the abc pioneered important elements of modern computing  including binary arithmetic and electronic switching elements  but its special purpose nature and lack of a changeable  stored program distinguish it from modern computers  the computer was designated an ieee milestone in      

atanasoff and berry s computer work was not widely known until it was rediscovered in the     s  amidst conflicting claims about the first instance of an electronic computer  at that time eniac  that had been created by john mauchly and j  presper eckert  was considered to be the first computer in the modern sense  but in      a u s  district court invalidated the eniac patent and concluded that the eniac inventors had derived the subject matter of the electronic digital computer from atanasoff  see patent dispute   when  in the mid     s  the secrecy surrounding the british world war ii development of the colossus computers that pre dated eniac  was lifted and colossus was described at a conference in los alamos  new mexico in june       john mauchly and konrad zuse were reported to have been astonished 

according to atanasoff s account  several key principles of the atanasoff   berry computer were conceived in a sudden insight after a long nighttime drive to rock island  illinois  during the winter of            the abc innovations included electronic computation  binary arithmetic  parallel processing  regenerative capacitor memory  and a separation of memory and computing functions  the mechanical and logic design was worked out by atanasoff over the next year  a grant application to build a proof of concept prototype was submitted in march      to the agronomy department which was also interested in speeding up computation for economic and research analysis         of further funding    to complete the machine came from the nonprofit research corporation of new york city 

the abc was built by atanasoff and berry in the basement of the physics building at iowa state college during            the initial funds were released in september  and the    tube prototype was first demonstrated in october       a december demonstration prompted a grant for construction of the full scale machine  the abc was built and tested over the next two years  a january          story in the  des moines register  announced the abc as  an electrical computing machine  with more than     vacuum tubes that would  compute complicated algebraic equations   but gave no precise technical description of the computer   the system weighed more than   it contained approximately of wire      dual triode vacuum tubes     thyratrons  and was about the size of a desk 

it was not a turing complete computer  which distinguishes it from more general machines  like contemporary konrad zuse s z          or later machines like the      eniac  the      edvac  the university of manchester designs  or alan turing s post war design of ace at npl and elsewhere  nor did it implement the stored program architecture that made practical fully general purpose  reprogrammable computers 
the machine was  however  the first to implement three critical ideas that are still part of every modern computer 

the memory of the atanasoff   berry computer was a system called  regenerative capacitor memory   which consisted of a pair of drums  each containing      capacitors that rotated on a common shaft once per second  the capacitors on each drum were organized into     bands  of        active bands and two spares in case a capacitor failed   giving the machine a speed of    additions subtractions per second  data was represented as    bit binary fixed point numbers  the electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on    such numbers at a time       bits  

the alternating current power line frequency of     hz was the primary clock rate for the lowest level operations 

the arithmetic logic functions were fully electronic  implemented with vacuum tubes  the family of logic gates ranged from inverters to two and three input gates  the input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates  each gate consisted of one inverting vacuum tube amplifier  preceded by a resistor divider input network that defined the logical function  the control logic functions  which only needed to operate once per drum rotation and therefore did not require electronic speed  were electromechanical  implemented with relays 

although the atanasoff   berry computer was an important step up from earlier calculating machines  it was not able to run entirely automatically through an entire problem  an operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions  much like the electro mechanical calculators and unit record equipment of the time  selection of the operation to be performed  reading  writing  converting to or from binary to decimal  or reducing a set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers 

there were two forms of input and output  primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input  the intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory   the largest problem that could be solved without the use of the intermediate output and input was two simultaneous equations  a trivial problem  

intermediate results were binary  written onto paper sheets by electrostatically modifying the resistance at      locations to represent    of the    bit numbers  one equation   each sheet could be written or read in one second  the reliability of the system was limited to about   error in         calculations by these units  primarily attributed to lack of control of the sheets  material characteristics  in retrospect a solution could have been to add a parity bit to each number as written  this problem was not solved by the time atanasoff left the university for war related work 

primary user input was decimal  via standard ibm    column punched cards and output was decimal  via a front panel display 

the abc was designed for a specific purpose  the solution of systems of simultaneous linear equations  it could handle systems with up to twenty nine equations  a difficult problem for the time  problems of this scale were becoming common in physics  the department in which john atanasoff worked  the machine could be fed two linear equations with up to twenty nine variables and a constant term and eliminate one of the variables  this process would be repeated manually for each of the equations  which would result in a system of equations with one fewer variable  then the whole process would be repeated to eliminate another variable 

george w  snedecor  the head of iowa state s statistics department  was very likely the first user of an electronic digital computer to solve real world mathematics problems  he submitted many of these problems to atanasoff 

on june           j  presper eckert and john mauchly were the first to file for patent on a digital computing device  eniac   much to the surprise of atanasoff  the abc had been examined by john mauchly in june       and isaac auerbach  a former student of mauchly s  alleged that it influenced his later work on eniac  although mauchly denied this  the eniac patent did not issue until       and by      honeywell sued sperry rand in an attempt to break the eniac patents  arguing the abc constituted prior art  the united states district court for the district of minnesota released its judgement on october           finding in  honeywell v  sperry rand  that the eniac patent was a derivative of john atanasoff s invention 

campbell kelly and aspray conclude 
the case was legally resolved on october          when u s  district judge earl r  larson held the eniac patent invalid  ruling that the eniac derived many basic ideas from the atanasoff   berry computer  judge larson explicitly stated 
herman goldstine  one of the original developers of eniac wrote 

the original abc was eventually dismantled in       when the university converted the basement to classrooms  and all of its pieces except for one memory drum were discarded 

in       a team of researchers led by john gustafson from ames laboratory  located on the iowa state campus  finished building a working replica of the atanasoff   berry computer at a cost of           equivalent to   million in    the replica abc is now on permanent display in the first floor lobby of the durham center for computation and communication at iowa state university    it is on loan to the computer history museum in mountain view  california for a major exhibition 







andes

the andes or andean mountains    are the longest continental mountain range in the world  forming a continuous highland along the western edge of south america  this range is about long  about wide  widest between      south and      south latitude   and of an average height of about   the andes extend from north to south through seven south american countries  venezuela  colombia  ecuador  peru  bolivia  chile and argentina 

along their length  the andes are split into several ranges  separated by intermediate depressions  the andes are the location of several high plateaus     some of which host major cities such as quito  bogot    arequipa  medell  n  sucre  m  rida and la paz  the altiplano plateau is the world s second highest after the tibetan plateau  these ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate  the tropical andes  the dry andes  and the wet andes 

the andes mountains are the world s highest mountain range outside asia  the highest mountain outside asia  argentina s mount aconcagua  rises to an elevation of about above sea level  the peak of chimborazo in the ecuadorian andes is farther from the earth s center than any other location on the earth s surface  due to the equatorial bulge resulting from the earth s rotation  the world s highest volcanoes are in the andes  including ojos del salado on the chile argentina border  which rises to  

the andes are also part of the american cordillera  a chain of mountain ranges  cordillera  that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western  backbone  of north america  central america  south america and antarctica 

the etymology of the word  andes  has been debated  the majority consensus is that it derives from the quechua word   which means  east  as in  antisuyu   quechua for  east region    one of the four regions of the inca empire 

the andes can be divided into three sections 

in the northern part of the andes  the isolated sierra nevada de santa marta range is often considered to be part of the andes  the term  cordillera  comes from the spanish word  cordel   meaning  rope   the andes range is about wide throughout its length  except in the bolivian flexure where it is about wide  the leeward antilles islands aruba  bonaire  and cura  ao  which lie in the caribbean sea off the coast of venezuela  were thought to represent the submerged peaks of the extreme northern edge of the andes range  but ongoing geological studies indicate that such a simplification does not do justice to the complex tectonic boundary between the south american and caribbean plates 

the andes are a mesozoic   tertiary orogenic belt of mountains along the pacific ring of fire  a zone of volcanic activity that encompasses the pacific rim of the americas as well as the asia pacific region  the andes are the result of tectonic plate processes  caused by the subduction of oceanic crust beneath the south american plate  it is the result of a convergent plate boundary between the nazca plate and the south american plate the main cause of the rise of the andes is the compression of the western rim of the south american plate due to the subduction of the nazca plate and the antarctic plate  to the east  the andes range is bounded by several sedimentary basins  such as orinoco  amazon basin  madre de dios and gran chaco  that separate the andes from the ancient cratons in eastern south america  in the south  the andes share a long boundary with the former patagonia terrane  to the west  the andes end at the pacific ocean  although the peru chile trench can be considered their ultimate western limit  from a geographical approach  the andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and a less rugged topography  the andes mountains also contain large quantities of iron ore located in many mountains within the range 

the andean orogen has a series of bends or oroclines  the bolivian orocline is a seaward concave bending in the coast of south america and the andes mountains at about      s  at this point  the orientation of the andes turns from northwest in peru to south in chile and argentina  the andean segment north and south of the orocline have been rotated      to      counter clockwise and clockwise respectively  the bolivian orocline area overlaps with the area of maximum width of the altiplano plateau and according to isacks        the orocline is related to crustal shortening  the specific point at      s where the coastline bends is known as the  arica elbow   further south lies the maipo orocline or maipo transition zone located between      s and     s with a break in trend at      s  near the southern tip of the andes lies the patagonian orocline 

the western rim of the south american plate has been the place of several pre andean orogenies since at least the late proterozoic and early paleozoic  when several terranes and microcontinents collided and amalgamated with the ancient cratons of eastern south america  by then the south american part of gondwana 

the formation of the modern andes began with the events of the triassic when pangaea began the break up that resulted in developing several rifts  the development continued through the jurassic period  it was during the cretaceous period that the andes began to take their present form  by the uplifting  faulting and folding of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of the ancient cratons to the east  the rise of the andes has not been constant  as different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress  uplift  and erosion 

tectonic forces above the subduction zone along the entire west coast of south america where the nazca plate and a part of the antarctic plate are sliding beneath the south american plate continue to produce an ongoing orogenic event resulting in minor to major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to this day  in the extreme south  a major transform fault separates tierra del fuego from the small scotia plate  across the wide drake passage lie the mountains of the antarctic peninsula south of the scotia plate which appear to be a continuation of the andes chain  

the regions immediately east of the andes experience a series of changes resulting from the andean orogeny  parts of the suns  s orogen in amazonian craton disappeared from the surface of earth being overridden by the andes 
the sierras de c  rdoba  where the effects of the ancient pampean orogeny can be observed  owe their modern uplift and relief to the andean orogeny in the tertiary  further south in southern patagonia the onset of the andean orogeny caused the magallanes basin to evolve from being an extensional back arc basin in the mesozoic to being a compressional foreland basin in the cenozoic 

the andes range has many active volcanoes distributed in four volcanic zones separated by areas of inactivity  the andean volcanism is a result of subduction of the nazca plate and antarctic plate underneath the south american plate  the belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones that are separated from each other by volcanic gaps  the volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style  products and morphology  while some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to  there are significant differences inside volcanic zones and even between neighbouring volcanoes  despite being a type location for calc alkalic and subduction volcanism  the andean volcanic belt has a large range of volcano tectonic settings  such as rift systems and extensional zones  transpressional faults  subduction of mid ocean ridges and seamount chains apart from a large range of crustal thicknesses and magma ascent paths  and different amount of crustal assimilations 

the andes mountains host large ore and salt deposits and some of their eastern fold and thrust belt acts as traps for commercially exploitable amounts of hydrocarbons  in the forelands of the atacama desert some of the largest porphyry copper mineralizations occurs making chile and peru the first and second largest exporters of copper in the world  porphyry copper in the western slopes of the andes has been generated by hydrothermal fluids  mostly water  during the cooling of plutons or volcanic systems  the porphyry mineralization further benefited from the dry climate that let them largely out of the disturbing actions of meteoric water  the dry climate in the central western andes has also led to the creation of extensive saltpeter deposits which were extensively mined until the invention of synthetic nitrates  yet another result of the dry climate are the salars of atacama and uyuni  the first one being the largest source of lithium today and the second the world s largest reserve of the element  early mesozoic and neogene plutonism in bolivia s cordillera central created the bolivian tin belt as well as the famous  now depleted  deposits of cerro rico de potos   

the climate in the andes varies greatly depending on latitude  altitude  and proximity to the sea  temperature  atmospheric pressure and humidity decrease in higher elevations  the southern section is rainy and cool  the central section is dry  the northern andes are typically rainy and warm  with an average temperature of in colombia  the climate is known to change drastically in rather short distances  rainforests exist just miles away from the snow covered peak cotopaxi  the mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas  the snow line depends on the location  it is at between in the tropical ecuadorian  colombian  venezuelan  and northern peruvian andes  rising to in the drier mountains of southern peru south to northern chile south to about     s  then descending to on aconcagua at     s  at     s  at     s  and only in tierra del fuego at     s  from     s  several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level 

the andes of chile and argentina can be divided in two climatic and glaciological zones  the dry andes and the wet andes  since the dry andes extend from the latitudes of atacama desert to the area of maule river  precipitation is more sporadic and there are strong temperature oscillations  the line of equilibrium may shift drastically over short periods of time  leaving a whole glacier in the ablation area or in the accumulation area 

in the high andes of central chile and mendoza province  rock glaciers are larger and more common than glaciers  this is due to the high exposure to solar radiation 

though precipitation increases with the height  there are semiarid conditions in the nearly highest mountains of the andes  this dry steppe climate is considered to be typical of the subtropical position at           s  the valley bottoms have no woods  just dwarf scrub  the largest glaciers  as e g  the plomo glacier and the horcones glaciers  do not even reach in length and have an only insignificant ice thickness  at glacial times  however  c         years ago  the glaciers were over ten times longer  on the east side of this section of the mendozina andes  they flowed down to and on the west side to about above sea level  the massifs of cerro aconcagua     cerro tupungato    and nevado juncal    are tens of kilometres away from each other and were connected by a joint ice stream network  the andes  dendritic glacier arms  i e  components of valley glaciers  were up to long  over thick and overspanned a vertical distance of   the climatic glacier snowline  ela  was lowered from to at glacial times 

the andean region cuts across several natural and floristic regions due to its extension from caribbean venezuela to cold  windy and wet cape horn passing through the hyperarid atacama desert  rainforests and tropical dry forests used to encircle much of the northern andes but are now greatly diminished  especially in the choc   and inter andean valleys of colombia  opposite of the humid andean slopes are the relatively dry andean slopes in most of western peru  chile and argentina  along with several interandean valles  they are typically dominated by deciduous woodland  shrub and xeric vegetation  reaching the extreme in the slopes near the virtually lifeless atacama desert 

about        species of vascular plants live in the andes  with roughly half being endemic to the region  surpassing the diversity of any other hotspot  the small tree  cinchona pubescens   a source of quinine which is used to treat malaria  is found widely in the andes as far south as bolivia  other important crops that originated from the andes are tobacco and potatoes  the high altitude  polylepis  forests and woodlands are found in the andean areas of colombia  ecuador  peru  bolivia and chile  these trees  by locals referred to as que  ua  yagual and other names  can be found at altitudes of above sea level  it remains unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural  or the result of clearing which began during the incan period  regardless  in modern times the clearance has accelerated  and the trees are now considered to be highly endangered  with some believing that as little as     of the original woodland remains 

the andes are rich in fauna  with almost       species  of which roughly     are endemic to the region  the andes are the most important region in the world for amphibians 
the diversity of animals in the andes is high  with almost     species of mammals      endemic   more than       species of birds  about     endemic   more than     species of reptile  about     endemic   and almost     species of fish  about     endemic  

the vicu  a and guanaco can be found living in the altiplano  while the closely related domesticated llama and alpaca are widely kept by locals as pack animals and for their meat and wool  the crepuscular  active during dawn and dusk  chinchillas  two threatened members of the rodent order  inhabit the andes  alpine regions  the andean condor  the largest bird of its kind in the western hemisphere  occurs throughout much of the andes but generally in very low densities  other animals found in the relatively open habitats of the high andes include the huemul  cougar  foxes in the genus  pseudalopex   and  for birds  certain species of tinamous  notably members of the genus  nothoprocta    andean goose  giant coot  flamingos  mainly associated with hypersaline lakes   lesser rhea  andean flicker  diademed sandpiper plover  miners  sierra finches and diuca finches 

lake titicaca hosts several endemics  among them the highly endangered titicaca flightless grebe and titicaca water frog  a few species of hummingbirds  notably some hillstars  can be seen at altitudes above   but far higher diversities can be found at lower altitudes  especially in the humid andean forests   cloud forests   growing on slopes in colombia  ecuador  peru  bolivia and far northwestern argentina  these forest types  which includes the yungas and parts of the choc    are very rich in flora and fauna  although few large mammals exist  exceptions being the threatened mountain tapir  spectacled bear and yellow tailed woolly monkey 

birds of humid andean forests include mountain toucans  quetzals and the andean cock of the rock  while mixed species flocks dominated by tanagers and furnariids commonly are seen     in contrast to several vocal but typically cryptic species of wrens  tapaculos and antpittas 

a number of species such as the royal cinclodes and white browed tit spinetail are associated with  polylepis   and consequently also threatened 

the andes mountains form a north south axis of cultural influences  a long series of cultural development culminated in the expansion of the inca civilization and inca empire in the central andes during the   th century  the incas formed this civilization through imperialistic militarism as well as careful and meticulous governmental management  the government sponsored the construction of aqueducts and roads in addition to preexisting installations  some of these constructions are still in existence today 

devastated by european diseases to which they had no immunity and civil wars  in      the incas were defeated by an alliance composed of tens of thousands of allies from nations they had subjugated  e g  huancas  chachapoyas  ca  aris  and a small army of     spaniards led by francisco pizarro  one of the few inca sites the spanish never found in their conquest was machu picchu  which lay hidden on a peak on the eastern edge of the andes where they descend to the amazon  the main surviving languages of the andean peoples are those of the quechua and aymara language families  woodbine parish and joseph barclay pentland surveyed a large part of the bolivian andes from      to      

in modern times  the largest cities in the andes are bogot    colombia  with a population of about eight million  santiago  chile  and medellin  colombia  lima is a coastal city adjacent to the andes and is the largest city of all andean countries  it is the seat of the andean community of nations 

la paz  bolivia s seat of government  is the highest capital city in the world  at an elevation of approximately   parts of the la paz conurbation  including the city of el alto  extend up to   

other cities in or near the andes include arequipa  cusco  huancayo  cajamarca  juliaca  hu  nuco  huaraz  and puno in peru  quito  cuenca  ambato  loja  riobamba  and ibarra in ecuador  cochabamba  oruro  sucre  and tarija in bolivia  mendoza  tucum  n  salta  and san juan in argentina  calama and rancagua in chile  cali  c  cuta  bucaramanga  ibagu    pereira  pasto  palmira  popay  n  tunja  villavicencio  and manizales in colombia  and barquisimeto  san crist  bal  m  rida  and valera in venezuela  the cities of caracas  valencia  and maracay are in the venezuelan coastal range  which is a debatable extension of the andes at the northern extreme of south america 

cities and large towns are connected with asphalt paved roads  while smaller towns are often connected by dirt roads  which may require a four wheel drive vehicle 

the rough terrain has historically put the costs of building highways and railroads that cross the andes out of reach of most neighboring countries  even with modern civil engineering practices  for example  the main crossover of the andes between argentina and chile is still accomplished through the paso internacional los libertadores  only recently the ends of some highways that came rather close to one another from the east and the west have been connected  much of the transportation of passengers is done via aircraft 

however  there is one railroad that connects chile with argentina via the andes  and there are others that make the same connection via southern bolivia  see railroad maps of that region 

there are multiple highways in bolivia that cross the andes  some of these were built during a period of war between bolivia and paraguay  in order to transport bolivian troops and their supplies to the war front in the lowlands of southeastern bolivia and western paraguay 

for decades  chile claimed ownership of land on the eastern side of the andes  however  these claims were given up in about      during the war of the pacific between chile  the allied bolivia and peru  in a diplomatic deal to keep argentina out of the war  the chilean army and chilean navy defeated the combined forces of bolivia and peru  and chile took over bolivia s only province on the pacific coast  some land from peru that was returned to peru decades later  bolivia has been a completely landlocked country ever since  it mostly uses seaports in eastern argentina and uruguay for international trade because its diplomatic relations with chile have been suspended since      

because of the tortuous terrain in places  villages and towns in the mountains   to which travel via motorized vehicles is of little use   are still located in the high andes of argentina  bolivia  peru  and ecuador  locally  the relatives of the camel  the llama  and the alpaca continue to carry out important uses as pack animals  but this use has generally diminished in modern times  donkeys  mules  and horses are also useful 

the ancient peoples of the andes such as the incas have practiced irrigation techniques for over       years  because of the mountain slopes  terracing has been a common practice  terracing  however  was only extensively employed after incan imperial expansions to fuel their expanding realm  the potato holds a very important role as an internally consumed staple crop  maize was also an important crop for these people  and was used for the production of chicha  important to andean native people  currently  tobacco  cotton and coffee are the main export crops  coca  despite eradication programmes in some countries  remains an important crop for legal local use in a mildly stimulating herbal tea  and  both controversially and illegally  for the production of cocaine 

in unirrigated land  pasture is the most common type of land use  in the rainy season  summer   part of the rangeland is used for cropping  mainly potatoes  barley  broad beans and wheat  

irrigation is helpful in advancing the sowing data of the summer crops which guarantees an early yield in the period of food shortage  also  by early sowing  maize can be cultivated higher up in the mountains  up to    in addition it makes cropping in the dry season  winter  possible and allows the cultivation of frost resistant vegetable crops like onion and carrot 

the andes rose to fame for their mineral wealth during the spanish conquest of south america  although andean amerindian peoples crafted ceremonial jewelry of gold and other metals  the mineralizations of the andes were first mined in large scale after the spanish arrival  potos   in present day bolivia and cerro de pasco in peru were one of the principal mines of the spanish empire in the new world  r  o de la plata and argentina derive their names from the silver of potos   

currently  mining in the andes of chile and peru places these countries as the first and third major producers of copper in the world  peru also contains the  th largest goldmine in the world  the yanacocha  the bolivian andes produce principally tin although historically silver mining had a huge impact on the economy of   th century europe 

there is a long history of mining in the andes  from the spanish silver mines in potos   in the   th century to the vast current porphyry copper deposits of chuquicamata and escondida in chile and toquepala in peru  other metals including iron  gold and tin in addition to non metallic resources are important 

this list contains some of the major peaks in the andes mountain range  the highest peak is aconcagua of argentina  see below  
















ancylopoda

ancylopoda is a group of browsing  herbivorous  mammals in the perissodactyla that show long  curved and cleft claws  morphological evidence indicates the ancylopoda diverged from the tapirs  rhinoceroses and horses  euperissodactyla  after the brontotheria  however earlier authorities such as osborn sometimes considered the ancylopoda to be outside perissodactyla or  as was popular more recently  to be related to brontotheria 

 macrotherium   which is typically from the middle miocene of sansan  in gers  france  may indicate a distinct genus  limb bones resembling those of macrotherium  but relatively stouter  have been described from the pliocene beds of attica and samos as  ancylotherium   in the americas  the names  morothorium  and  moropus  have been applied to similar bones  in the belief that they indicated xenarthrans   macrotherium magnum  must have been an animal of about nine feet in length 

the south american genus  homalodotherium  is sometimes placed in the ancylopoda  but arguments against this have been given by professor h  f  osborn  who considers that the ancylopoda are directly descended from the condylarthra 




anchor

an anchor is a device  normally made of metal  used to connect a vessel to the bed of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to wind or current  the word derives from latin  ancora   which itself comes from the greek                 ankura   

anchors can either be temporary or permanent  permanent anchors are used in the creation of a mooring  and are rarely moved  a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain them  vessels carry one or more temporary anchors  which may be of different designs and weights 

a sea anchor is a drogue  not in contact with the seabed  used to control a drifting vessel 

anchors achieve holding power either by  hooking  into the seabed  via sheer mass  or a combination of the two  permanent moorings use large masses  commonly a block or slab of concrete  resting on the seabed  semi permanent mooring anchors  such as mushroom anchors  and large ship s anchors derive a significant portion of their holding power from their mass  while also hooking or embedding in the bottom  modern anchors for smaller vessels have metal  flukes  which hook on to rocks on the bottom or bury themselves in soft seabed 

the vessel is attached to the anchor by the  rode   commonly called  cable  when made of rope  and made of chain in larger vessels   or a combination of these  the ratio of the length of rode to the water depth is known as the scope  generally  the rode should be between   and    times the depth of the seabed  giving a scope of     or       the larger the number  the shallower the angle is between the cable and the seafloor  and the less upwards force is acting on the anchor  a      scope gives the greatest holding power  but also allows for much more drifting due to the longer amount of cable paid out  anchoring with sufficient scope and or heavy chain rode brings the direction of strain close to parallel with the seabed  this is particularly important for light  modern anchors designed to bury in the bottom  where scopes of    to   to   are common  whereas heavy anchors and moorings can use a scope of   to    or less 

since all anchors that embed themselves in the bottom require the strain to be along the seabed  anchors can be broken out of the bottom by shortening the rope until the vessel is directly above the anchor  at this point the anchor chain is  up and down   in naval parlance  if necessary  motoring slowly around the location of the anchor also helps dislodge it  anchors are sometimes fitted with a tripping line attached to the crown  by which they can be unhooked from rocks or coral 

the term  aweigh  describes an anchor when it is hanging on the rope and is not resting on the bottom  this is linked to the term  to weigh anchor   meaning to lift the anchor from the sea bed  allowing the ship or boat to move  an anchor is described as  aweigh  when it has been broken out of the bottom and is being hauled up to be  stowed    aweigh  should not be confused with  under way   which describes a vessel which is not  moored  to a dock or  anchored   whether or not the vessel is moving through the water 

the earliest anchors were probably rocks  and many rock anchors have been found dating from at least the bronze age  pre european maori waka  canoes  used one or more hollowed stones  tied with flax ropes  as anchors  many modern moorings still rely on a large rock as the primary element of their design  however  using pure mass to resist the forces of a storm only works well as a permanent mooring  a large enough rock would be nearly impossible to move to a new location 

the ancient greeks used baskets of stones  large sacks filled with sand  and wooden logs filled with lead  according to apollonius rhodius and stephen of byzantium  anchors were formed of stone  and athenaeus states that they were also sometimes made of wood  such anchors held the vessel merely by their weight and by their friction along the bottom  iron was afterwards introduced for the construction of anchors  and an improvement was made by forming them with teeth  or  flukes   to fasten themselves into the bottom 

the admiralty pattern   a p    or simply  admiralty   and also known as  fisherman   is the anchor shape most familiar to non sailors  it consists of a central shank with a ring or shackle for attaching the rode  at the other end of the shank there are two arms  carrying the flukes  while the stock is mounted to the shackle end  at ninety degrees to the arms  when the anchor lands on the bottom  it will generally fall over with the arms parallel to the seabed  as a strain comes onto the rode  the stock will dig into the bottom  canting the anchor until one of the flukes catches and digs into the bottom 

this basic design remained unchanged for centuries  with the most significant changes being to the overall proportions  and a move from stocks made of wood to iron stocks in the late     s and early     s  since one fluke always protrudes up from the set anchor  there is a great tendency of the rode to foul the anchor as the vessel swings due to wind or current shifts  when this happens  the anchor may be pulled out of the bottom  and in some cases may need to be hauled up to be re set  in the mid   th century  numerous modifications were attempted to alleviate these problems  as well as improve holding power  including one armed mooring anchors  the most successful of these  patent anchors   the trotman anchor  introduced a pivot where the arms join the shank  allowing the  idle  arm to fold against the shank 

handling and storage of these anchors requires special equipment and procedures  once the anchor is hauled up to the hawsepipe  the ring end is hoisted up to the end of a timber projecting from the bow known as the cathead  the crown of the anchor is then hauled up with a heavy tackle until one fluke can be hooked over the rail  this is known as  catting and fishing  the anchor  before dropping the anchor  the fishing process is reversed  and the anchor is dropped from the end of the cathead 

the stockless anchor  patented in england in       represented the first significant departure in anchor design in centuries  though their holding power to weight ratio is significantly lower than admiralty pattern anchors  their ease of handling and stowage aboard large ships led to almost universal adoption  in contrast to the elaborate stowage procedures for earlier anchors  stockless anchors are simply hauled up until they rest with the shank inside the hawsepipes  and the flukes against the hull  or inside a recess in the hull  

while there are numerous variations  stockless anchors consist of a set of heavy flukes connected by a pivot or ball and socket joint to a shank  cast into the crown of the anchor is a set of tripping palms  projections that drag on the bottom  forcing the main flukes to dig in 

until the mid   th century  anchors for smaller vessels were either scaled down versions of admiralty anchors  or simple grapnels  as new designs with greater holding power to weight ratios  a great variety of anchor designs has emerged  many of these designs are still under patent  and other types are best known by their original trademarked names 

a traditional design  the grapnel is merely a shank with four or more tines  it has a benefit in that  no matter how it reaches the bottom  one or more tines will be aimed to set  in coral  or rock  it is often able to set quickly by hooking into the structure  but may be more difficult to retrieve  a grapnel is often quite light  and may have additional uses as a tool to recover gear lost overboard  its weight also makes it relatively easy to move and carry  however its shape is generally not very compact and it may be awkward to stow unless a collapsing model is used 

grapnels rarely have enough fluke area to develop much hold in sand  clay  or mud  it is not unknown for the anchor to foul on its own rode  or to foul the tines with refuse from the bottom  preventing it from digging in  on the other hand  it is quite possible for this anchor to find such a good hook that  without a trip line from the crown  it is impossible to retrieve 

designed by famous yacht designer l  francis herreshoff  this is essentially the same pattern as an admiralty anchor  albeit with small diamond shaped flukes or palms  the novelty of the design lay in the means by which it could be broken down into three pieces for stowage  in use  it still presents all the issues of the admiralty pattern anchor 

originally designed as a lightweight anchor for seaplanes  this design consists of two plough like blades mounted to a shank  with a folding stock crossing through the crown of the anchor 

so named due to its resemblance to a traditional agricultural plough  many manufacturers produce a plough style design  all based on or direct copies of the original cqr   secure    a      design patented in the uk  us patent in       by mathematician geoffrey ingram taylor  ploughs are popular with cruising sailors and other private boaters  they are generally good in all bottoms  but not exceptional in any  the cqr design has a hinged shank  despite the widely held belief that this is to allow the anchor to turn with direction changes rather than breaking out  the actual purpose is to prevent the weight of the shank from negatively impacting the fluke s orientation while setting  other plough types have a rigid shank  plough anchors are usually stowed in a roller at the bow 

owing to the use of lead or other dedicated tip weight  the plough is heavier than average for the amount of resistance developed  and may take more careful technique and a longer period to set thoroughly  it cannot be stored in a hawsepipe 

the delta was developed in the     s for commercialization by british marine manufacturer simpson   lawrence  it is a plough anchor with a rigid  arched shank  it is described as  self launching  because it can be dropped from a bow roller simply by paying out the rode  without manual assistance 

american richard danforth invented the danforth pattern in the     s for use aboard landing craft  it uses a stock at the crown to which two large flat triangular flukes are attached  the stock is hinged so the flukes can orient toward the bottom  and on some designs may be adjusted for an optimal angle depending on the bottom type   tripping palms at the crown act to tip the flukes into the seabed  the design is a burying variety  and once well set can develop high resistance  its lightweight and compact flat design make it easy to retrieve and relatively easy to store  some anchor rollers and hawsepipes can accommodate a fluke style anchor 

a danforth will not usually penetrate or hold in gravel or weeds  in boulders and coral it may hold by acting as a hook  if there is much current  or if the vessel is moving while dropping the anchor  it may  kite  or  skate  over the bottom due to the large fluke area acting as a sail or wing 

the fob hp anchor designed in brittany in the     s is a danforth variant designed to give increased holding through its use of rounded flukes setting at a      angle 

the fortress is an american aluminum alloy danforth variant which can be disassembled for storage and it features an adjustable      and      shank fluke angle to improve holding capability in common sea bottoms such as hard sand and soft mud  this anchor performed well in a      us naval sea systems command  navsea  test  and in an august      holding power test that was conducted in the soft mud bottoms of the chesapeake bay 

this claw shaped anchor was designed by peter bruce from the isle of man in the     s  bruce gained his early reputation from the production of large scale commercial anchors for ships and fixed installations such as oil rigs  the bruce and its copies  known generically as  claws   have become a popular option for small boaters  it was intended to address some of the problems of the only general purpose option then available  the plough  claw types set quickly in most seabeds and although not an articulated design  they have the reputation of not breaking out with tide or wind changes  instead slowly turning in the bottom to align with the force 

claw types have difficulty penetrating weedy bottoms and grass  they offer a fairly low holding power to weight ratio and generally have to be oversized to compete with newer types  on the other hand  they have a good reputation in boulder bottoms  perform relatively well with low rode scopes and set fairly reliably  they cannot be used with hawsepipes 

in recent years there has been something of a spurt in anchor design  primarily designed to set very quickly  then generate high holding power  these anchors  mostly proprietary inventions still under patent  are finding homes with users of small to medium sized vessels 



these are used where the vessel is permanently or semi permanently sited  for example in the case of lightvessels or channel marker buoys  the anchor needs to hold the vessel in all weathers  including the most severe storm  but needs to be lifted only occasionally  at most     for example  only if the vessel is to be towed into port for maintenance  an alternative to using an anchor under these circumstances  especially if the anchor need never be lifted at all  may be to use a pile driven into the seabed 

permanent anchors come in a wide range of types and have no standard form  a slab of rock with an iron staple in it to attach a chain to would serve the purpose  as would any dense object of appropriate weight  for instance  an engine block   modern moorings may be anchored by augers  which look and act very much like oversized screws drilled into the seabed  or by barbed metal beams pounded in  or even driven in with explosives  like pilings  or by a variety of other non mass means of getting a grip on the bottom  one method of building a mooring is to use three or more conventional anchors laid out with short lengths of chain attached to a swivel  so no matter which direction the vessel moves  one or more anchors will be aligned to resist the force 

the mushroom anchor is suitable where the seabed is composed of silt or fine sand  it was invented by robert stevenson  for use by an    ton converted fishing boat   pharos   which was used as a lightvessel between      and      near to bell rock whilst the lighthouse was being constructed  it was equipped with a     ton example 

it is shaped like an inverted mushroom  the head becoming buried in the silt  a counterweight is often provided at the other end of the shank to lay it down before it becomes buried 

a mushroom anchor will normally sink in the silt to the point where it has displaced its own weight in bottom material  thus greatly increasing its holding power  these anchors are only suitable for a silt or mud bottom  since they rely upon suction and cohesion of the bottom material  which rocky or coarse sand bottoms lack  the holding power of this anchor is at best about twice its weight until it becomes buried  when it can be as much as ten times its weight  they are available in sizes from about    kg up to several tons 

this is an anchor which relies solely on being a heavy weight  it is usually just a large block of concrete or stone at the end of the chain  its holding power is defined by its weight underwater  i e  taking its buoyancy into account  regardless of the type of seabed  although suction can increase this if it becomes buried  consequently  deadweight anchors are used where mushroom anchors are unsuitable  for example in rock  gravel or coarse sand  an advantage of a deadweight anchor over a mushroom is that if it does become dragged  then it continues to provide its original holding force  the disadvantage of using deadweight anchors in conditions where a mushroom anchor could be used is that it needs to be around ten times the weight of the equivalent mushroom anchor 

auger anchors can be used to anchor permanent moorings  floating docks  fish farms  etc  these anchors  which have one or more slightly pitched self drilling threads  must be screwed into the seabed with the use of a tool  so require access to the bottom  either at low tide or by use of a diver  hence they can be difficult to install in deep water without special equipment 

weight for weight  augers have a higher holding than other permanent designs  and so can be cheap and relatively easily installed  although difficult to set in extremely soft mud 

there is a need in the oil and gas industry to resist large anchoring forces when laying pipelines and for drilling vessels  these anchors are installed and removed using a support tug and pennant pendant wire  some examples are the stevin range supplied by vrijhof ankers  large plate anchors such as the stevmanta are used for permanent moorings 

the elements of anchoring gear include the anchor  the cable  also called a rode   the method of attaching the two together  the method of attaching the cable to the ship  charts  and a method of learning the depth of the water 

vessels may carry a number of anchors  bower anchors  formerly known as  sheet anchors    are the main anchors used by a vessel and normally carried at the bow of the vessel  a kedge anchor is a light anchor used for warping an anchor  also known as  kedging   or more commonly on yachts for mooring quickly or in benign conditions  a stream anchor  which is usually heavier than a  kedge anchor   can be used for kedging or warping in addition to temporary mooring and restraining stern movement in tidal conditions or in waters where vessel movement needs to be restricted  such as rivers and channels  a killick anchor is a small  possibly improvised  anchor 

charts are vital to good anchoring  knowing the location of potential dangers  as well as being useful in estimating the effects of weather and tide in the anchorage  is essential in choosing a good place to drop the hook  one can get by without referring to charts  but they are an important tool and a part of good anchoring gear  and a skilled mariner would not choose to anchor without them 

the depth of water is necessary for determining scope  which is the ratio of length of cable to the depth measured from the highest point  usually the anchor roller or bow chock  to the seabed  for example  if the water is deep  and the anchor roller is above the water  the scope is the ratio between the amount of cable let out and   for this reason it is important to have a reliable and accurate method of measuring the depth of water 

a cable or rode is the rope  chain  or combination thereof used to connect the anchor to the vessel 

chain rode is relatively heavy but resists abrasion from coral  sharp rocks  or shellfish beds which may abrade a pure rope warp  fibre rope is more susceptible to abrasion on the seabed or obstructions  and is more likely to fail without warning 

combinations of a length of chain shackled to the anchor  with rope added to the other end of the chain are a common compromise on small craft 

the best rope for warps is nylon which is strong and flexible  terylene  polyester  is stronger but has less flex  both ropes sink  so they avoid fouling other craft in crowded anchorages and do not absorb much water  neither breaks down quickly in sunlight  polypropylene or polythene are not suited to warps as they float and are much weaker than nylon and only slightly stronger than natural fibres  they break down in sunlight  natural fibres such as manila or hemp are still used in developing nations but absorb much water  are relatively weak and rot  they do give good grip and are often very cheap  all anchors should have chain at least equal to the boat s length  some skippers prefer an all chain warp for added security in coral waters  boats less than    m typically use    mm galvanized chain          m craft use    mm chain and over     m use     mm chain  the chain should be shackled to the warp through a steel eye or spliced to the chain using a chain splice  the shackle pin should be securely wired  either galvanized or stainless steel is suitable for eyes and shackles 

in moderate conditions the ratio of warp to water depth should be      in rough conditions it should be twice this with the extra length giving more stretch to resist the anchor breaking out  this means that small craft under    m should carry at least     m of    mm warp         m craft           m of     mm warp          m should carry            m of     mm warp and over     m the same length but     mm warp 

the basic anchoring consists of determining the location  dropping the anchor  laying out the scope  setting the hook  and assessing where the vessel ends up  the ship will seek a location which is sufficiently protected  has suitable holding ground  enough depth at low tide and enough room for the boat to swing 

the location to drop the anchor should be approached from down wind or down current  whichever is stronger  as the chosen spot is approached  the vessel should be stopped or even beginning to drift back  the anchor should be lowered quickly but under control until it is on the bottom  see anchor windlass   the vessel should continue to drift back  and the cable should be veered out under control so it will be relatively straight 

once the desired scope is laid out  the vessel should be gently forced astern  usually using the auxiliary motor but possibly by backing a sail  a hand on the anchor line may telegraph a series of jerks and jolts  indicating the anchor is dragging  or a smooth tension indicative of digging in  as the anchor begins to dig in and resist backward force  the engine may be throttled up to get a thorough set  if the anchor continues to drag  or sets after having dragged too far  it should be retrieved and moved back to the desired position  or another location chosen  

there are techniques of anchoring to limit the swing of a vessel if the anchorage has limited room 

lowering a concentrated  heavy weight down the anchor line     rope or chain     directly in front of the bow to the seabed behaves like a heavy chain rode and lowers the angle of pull on the anchor  if the weight is suspended off the seabed it acts as a spring or shock absorber to dampen the sudden actions that are normally transmitted to the anchor and can cause it to dislodge and drag  in light conditions  a kellet will reduce the swing of the vessel considerably  in heavier conditions these effects disappear as the rode becomes straightened and the weight ineffective  known as a  anchor chum weight  or  angel  in the uk 

using two anchors set approximately      apart  or wider angles up to       from the bow is a strong mooring for facing into strong winds  to set anchors in this way  first one anchor is set in the normal fashion  then  taking in on the first cable as the boat is motored into the wind and letting slack while drifting back  a second anchor is set approximately a half scope away from the first on a line perpendicular to the wind  after this second anchor is set  the scope on the first is taken up until the vessel is lying between the two anchors and the load is taken equally on each cable 
this moor also to some degree limits the range of a vessel s swing to a narrower oval  care should be taken that other vessels will not swing down on the boat due to the limited swing range 

 not to be mistaken with the  bahamian moor   below   in the  bow and stern  technique  an anchor is set off each the bow and the stern  which can severely limit a vessel s swing range and also align it to steady wind  current or wave conditions  one method of accomplishing this moor is to set a bow anchor normally  then drop back to the limit of the bow cable  or to double the desired scope  e g      if the eventual scope should be           if the eventual scope should be      etc   to lower a stern anchor  by taking up on the bow cable the stern anchor can be set  after both anchors are set  tension is taken up on both cables to limit the swing or to align the vessel 

similar to the above  a  bahamian moor  is used to sharply limit the swing range of a vessel  but allows it to swing to a current  one of the primary characteristics of this technique is the use of a swivel as follows  the first anchor is set normally  and the vessel drops back to the limit of anchor cable  a second anchor is attached to the end of the anchor cable  and is dropped and set  a swivel is attached to the middle of the anchor cable  and the vessel connected to that 

the vessel will now swing in the middle of two anchors  which is acceptable in strong reversing currents  but a wind perpendicular to the current may break out the anchors  as they are not aligned for this load 

also known as  tandem anchoring   in this technique two anchors are deployed in line with each other  on the same rode  with the foremost anchor reducing the load on the aft most  this technique can develop great holding power and may be appropriate in  ultimate storm  circumstances  it does not limit swinging range  and might not be suitable in some circumstances  there are complications  and the technique requires careful preparation and a level of skill and experience above that required for a single anchor 

 kedging  or  warping  is a technique for moving or turning a ship by using a relatively light anchor 

in yachts  a kedge anchor is an anchor carried in addition to the main  or bower anchors  and usually stowed aft  every yacht should carry at least two anchors     the main or  bower  anchor and a second lighter  kedge  anchor  it is used occasionally when it is necessary to limit the turning circle as the yacht swings when it is anchored  such as in a very narrow river or a deep pool in an otherwise shallow area 

for ships  a kedge may be dropped while a ship is underway  or carried out in a suitable direction by a tender or ship s boat to enable the ship to be winched off if aground or swung into a particular heading  or even to be held steady against a tidal or other stream 

historically  it was of particular relevance to sailing warships which used them to outmaneuver opponents when the wind had dropped but might be used by any vessel in confined  shoal water to place it in a more desirable position  provided she had enough manpower 

club hauling is an archaic technique  when a vessel is in a narrow channel or on a lee shore so that there is no room to tack the vessel in a conventional manner  an anchor attached to the lee quarter may be dropped from the lee bow  this is deployed when the vessel is head to wind and has lost headway  as the vessel gathers sternway the strain on the cable pivots the vessel around what is now the weather quarter turning the vessel onto the other tack  the anchor is then normally cut away  as it cannot be recovered 

an anchor frequently appears on the flags and coats of arms of institutions involved with the sea  both naval and commercial  as well as of port cities and seacoast regions and provinces in various countries  there also exists in heraldry the  anchored cross   or mariner s cross  a stylized cross in the shape of an anchor  the symbol can be used to signify  fresh start  or  hope   the new testament refers to the christian s hope as  an anchor of the soul   hebrews        in       the delta gamma fraternity adopted the anchor as its badge to signify hope  the mariner s cross is also referred to as st  clement s cross  in reference to the way this saint was martyred  being tied to an anchor and thrown from a boat into the black sea in       anchored crosses are occasionally a feature of coats of arms in which context they are referred to by the heraldic terms  anchry  or  ancre  








anbar  town 

anbar    was a town in iraq  at lat     deg      n   long     deg      e  on the east bank of the euphrates  just south of the nahr  isa  or sakhlawieh canal  the northernmost of the canals connecting that river with the tigris 

anbar was originally called p  r  z     p  r or p  r  z     buhr  from   meaning  victorious shapur   in  prgwz  hypwhr   in    and became known as perisapora or pirisabora to the greeks and romans  the city was founded by the sasanian persian king shapur ii  and in the sassanid province of as  rist  n  perisapora was sacked and burned by emperor julian in april      during his invasion of the sasanian empire  the town became a refuge for the arab  christian and jewish colonies of that region  according to medieval arabic sources  most of the inhabitants of the town migrated north to found the city of hdatta south of mosul 

anbar was adjacent or identical to the babylonian jewish center of nehardea     and lies a short distance from the present day town of fallujah  formerly the babylonian jewish center of pumbedita    

the name of the town was then changed to  anbar   middle persian word for  granaries    abu al abbas as saffah  the founder of the abbasid caliphate  made it his capital  and such it remained until the founding of baghdad in      
it continued to be a place of much importance throughout the abbasid period 

anbar used to host an assyrian community from the fifth century  the town was the seat of a bishopric of the church of the east  the names of fourteen of its bishops of the period            are known  three of whom became chaldean patriarch of babylon 
no longer a residential bishopric  having faded 

anbar is today listed by the catholic church as a titular see of the chaldean catholic church  established as titular bishopric in      
it has had the following incumbents  generally of the lowest  episcopal  rank   with a single archiepiscopal  intermediate  exception  the first  

it is now entirely deserted  occupied only by mounds of ruins  whose great number indicate the city s former importance

anazarbus

anazarbus    medieval ain zarba  modern anavarza    was an ancient cilician city and  arch bishopric  which remains a latin catholic titular see 

it was situated in anatolia in modern turkey  in the present   ukurova  or classical aleian plain  about     km west of the main stream of the present ceyhan river  or classical pyramus river  and near its tributary the sempas su 

a lofty isolated ridge formed its acropolis  though some of the masonry in the ruins is certainly pre roman  the suda s identification of it with cyinda  famous as a treasure city in the wars of eumenes of cardia  cannot be accepted in the face of strabo s express location of cyinda in western cilicia 

it was founded by assyrians  under the early roman empire the place was known as caesarea     and was the metropolis  capital  of late roman province cilicia secunda  it was the home of the poet oppian 
rebuilt by the eastern roman emperor justin i after an earthquake in the  th century  it became justinopolis        but the old native name persisted  and when thoros i  king of lesser armenia  made it his capital early in the   th century  it was known as anazarva 

its great natural strength and situation  not far from the mouth of the sis pass  and near the great road which debouched from the cilician gates  made anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the eastern roman empire and the early muslim invaders  it had been rebuilt by harun al rashid in      refortified at great expense by the hamdanid sayf al dawla  mid   th century  and again destroyed in     by nikephoros ii phokas 

in late      or early      it was captured by the armies of the first crusade and was incorporated into bohemond s principality of antioch  the crusaders are probably responsible for the construction of an impressive donjon atop the center of the outcrop  most of the remaining fortifications  including the curtain walls  massive horse shaped towers  undercrofts  cisterns  and free standing structures date from the armenian periods of occupation  which began with the arrival of the rubenid baron t   oros i    the site briefly exchanged hands between the greeks and armenians  until it was formally part of the armenian kingdom of cilicia  within the fortress are two armenian chapels and the magnificent  but severely damaged  three aisle church built by t   oros i to celebrate his conquests  the church was once surrounded by a continuous  well executed dedicatory inscription in armenian 

the mamluk empire of egypt finally destroyed the city in      

the present wall of the lower city is of late construction  it encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine triumphal arch  the colonnades of two streets  a gymnasium  etc  a stadium and a theatre lie outside the walls to the south  the remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting  including roads and ditches hewn in the rock  there are no notable structures in the upper town  for picturesqueness the site is not equaled in cilicia  and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine aqueducts to their sources  a necropolis on the escarpment to the south of the curtain wall can also be seen complete with signs of illegal modern excavations 

a visit in december      showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed  only small  isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood  a powerful earthquake that struck the area in      is thought to be responsible for the destruction 

a modest turkish farming village  dilekkaya  lies to the southwest of the ancient city  a small outdoor museum with some of the artifacts collected in the area can be viewed for a small fee  also nearby are some beautiful mosaics discovered in a farmers field  inquire at the museum for a viewing 

anazarbus anavarsa was one of a chain of armenian fortifications stretching through cilicia  the castle of sis  modern kozan  adana  lies to the north while tumlu castle and yilankale are to the south  and the fortresses of amouda and sarvandikar are to the east 

in       excavations uncovered the first known colonnaded double lane road of the ancient world     meters wide and      meters long  also uncovered the ruins of a church and a bathhouse 

in       archaeologists discovered a limestone statue of the goddess hygieia and the god eros  the statue is thought to date to the third or fourth century b c 

anazarbus was the capital and so also from      the date of the second council of constantinople  the metropolitan see of the late roman province of cilicia secunda 

in the  th century  one of the bishops of anazarbus was athanasius  a  consistent expounder of the theology of arius   his theological opponent  athanasius of alexandria  in de synodis       refers to anazarbus as                    

a  th century  notitia episcopatuum  indicates that it had as suffragan sees epiphania  alexandria minor  irenopolis  flavias  castabala and aegeae  rhosus was also subject to anazarbus  but after the  th century was made exempt  and mopsuestia was raised to the rank of autcephalous metropolitan see  though without suffragans 

it faded  but got two catholic titular successor sees 

the archdiocese was nominally restored in the   th century  when was established a latin catholic metropolitan titular archbishopric of anazarbus 

it is vacant  having had the following incumbents  generally of the highest  metropolitan  rank   with an episcopal  lowest rank  exception  

in the   th century  an armenian catholic titular bishopric of anazarbus  of the armenians   anazarbus degli armeniin curiate italian  was established 

it was a suppressed in       having had a single incumbent  of the intermediary  archiepiscopal  rank  







anagram

an anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase  typically using all the original letters exactly once  for example  the word  anagram  can be rearranged into  nag a ram   or the word  binary  into  brainy  

the original word or phrase is known as the  subject  of the anagram  any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram  someone who creates anagrams may be called an  anagrammatist   and the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject 

anagrams do not necessarily have to use all the letters  but they normally do 

anagrams may be created as a commentary on the subject  they may be a synonym or antonym of their subject  a parody  a criticism or satire  for example 

an anagram which means the opposite of its subject is called an  antigram   for example 


they can sometimes change from a proper noun or personal name into an appropriate sentence 


they can change part of speech  such as the adjective  silent  to the verb  listen   

 anagrams  itself can be anagrammatized as   ars magna    latin   the great art   

anagrams can be traced back to the time of the ancient greeks  and were then known as  themuru  or changing  which was to find the hidden and mystical meaning in names 
they were popular throughout europe during the middle ages  for example with the poet and composer guillaume de machaut  they are said to go back at least to the greek poet lycophron  in the third century bce  but this relies on an account of lycophron given by john tzetzes in the   th century 

anagrams in latin were considered witty over many centuries   est vir qui adest   explained below  was cited as the example in samuel johnson s  a dictionary of the english language   they became hugely popular in the early modern period  especially in germany 

any historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings that were current for the language in question  in particular  spelling in english only slowly became fixed  there were attempts to regulate anagram formation  an important one in english being that of george puttenham s  of the anagram or posy transposed  in  the art of english poesie         

as a literary game when latin was the common property of the literate  latin anagrams were prominent   two examples are the change of  ave maria  gratia plena  dominus tecum    hail mary  full of grace  the lord  is  with you   into  virgo serena  pia  munda et immaculata    serene virgin  pious  clean and spotless    and the anagrammatic answer to pilate s question   quid est veritas     what is truth     namely   est vir qui adest    it is the man who is here    the origins of these are not documented 

latin continued to influence letter values  such as i   j  u   v and w   vv   there was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be  perfect  if the letters were all used once  but allowing for these interchanges  this can be seen in a popular latin anagram against the jesuits   societas jesu  turned into  vitiosa seces   or  cut off the wicked things   puttenham  in the time of elizabeth i of england  wished to start from  elissabet anglorum regina   elizabeth queen of the english   to obtain  multa regnabis ense gloria   by thy sword shalt thou reign in great renown   he explains carefully that h is  a note of aspiration only and no letter   and that z in greek or hebrew is a mere ss  the rules were not completely fixed in the   th century  william camden in his  remains  commented  singling out some letters       k  w  and z   not found in the classical roman alphabet 

when it comes to the   th century and anagrams in english or other languages  there is a great deal of documented evidence of learned interest  the lawyer thomas egerton was praised through the anagram  gestat honorem    he carries honor    the physician george ent took the anagrammatic motto  genio surget    he rises through spirit genius    which requires his first name as  georgius   james i s courtiers discovered in  james stuart   a just master   and converted  charles james stuart  into  claims arthur s seat   even at that point in time  the letters i and j were more or less interchangeable   walter quin  tutor to the future charles i  worked hard on multilingual anagrams on the name of father james  a notorious murder scandal  the overbury case  threw up two imperfect anagrams that were aided by typically loose spelling and were recorded by simonds d ewes   francis howard   for frances carr  countess of somerset  her maiden name spelled in a variant  became  car findes a whore   with the letters e hardly counted  and the victim thomas overbury  as  thomas overburie   was written as  o  o  a busie murther   an old form of  murder    with a v counted as u 

william drummond of hawthornden  in an essay  on the character of a perfect anagram   tried to lay down rules for permissible substitutions  such as s standing for z  and letter omissions  william camden provided a definition of  anagrammatisme  as  a dissolution of a name truly written into his letters  as his elements  and a new connection of it by artificial transposition  without addition  subtraction or change of any letter  into different words  making some perfect sense applyable  i e   applicable  to the person named   dryden in  macflecknoe  disdainfully called the pastime the  torturing of one poor word ten thousand ways  

 eleanor audeley   wife of sir john davies  is said to have been brought before the high commission in      for extravagances  stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed to  reveale  o daniel   and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram submitted by sir john lambe  the dean of the arches   dame eleanor davies    never soe mad a ladie  

an example from france was a flattering anagram for cardinal richelieu  comparing him to hercules or at least one of his hands  hercules being a kingly symbol   where  armand de richelieu  became  ardue main d hercule    difficult hand of hercules   

examples from the nineteenth century are the transposition of  horatio nelson  into   honor est a nilo    latin    honor is from the nile    and of  florence nightingale  into  flit on  cheering angel   the victorian love of anagramming as recreation is alluded to by augustus de morgan using his own name as example   great gun  do us a sum   is attributed to his son william de morgan  but a family friend john thomas graves was prolific  and a manuscript with over       has been preserved 

with the advent of surrealism as a poetic movement  anagrams regained the artistic respect they had had in the baroque period  the german poet unica z  rn  who made extensive use of anagram techniques  came to regard obsession with anagrams as a  dangerous fever   because it created isolation of the author  the surrealist leader andr   breton coined the anagram  avida dollars  for salvador dal    to tarnish his reputation by the implication of commercialism 

while anagramming is certainly a recreation first  there are ways in which anagrams are put to use  and these can be more serious  or at least not quite frivolous and formless  for example  psychologists use anagram oriented tests  often called  anagram solution tasks   to assess the implicit memory of young adults and adults alike 

natural philosophers  astronomers and others  of the   th century transposed their discoveries into latin anagrams  to establish their priority  in this way they laid claim to new discoveries  before their results were ready for publication 

galileo used  smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras  for  altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi   latin   i have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form   for discovering the rings of saturn in       galileo announced his discovery that venus had phases like the moon in the form  haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur oy   latin   these immature ones have already been read in vain by me  oy    that is  when rearranged   cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum   latin   the mother of loves    venus  imitates the figures of cynthia    the moon     in both cases  johannes kepler had solved the anagrams incorrectly  assuming they were talking about the moons of mars   salve  umbistineum geminatum martia proles   and a red spot on jupiter   macula rufa in jove est gyratur mathem    respectively  by coincidence  he turned out to be right about the actual objects existing 

in       christiaan huygens  using a telescope superior to those available to galileo  figured that galileo s earlier observations of saturn actually meant it had a ring  galileo s tools were only sufficient to see it as bumps  and  like galileo  had published an anagram saying  aaaaaaacccccdeeeeeghiiiiiiillllmmnnnnnnnnnooooppqrrstttttuuuuu   upon confirming his observations  three years later he revealed it to mean  annuto cingitur  tenui  plano  nusquam coherente  ad eclipticam inclinato   latin   it  saturn  is surrounded by a thin  flat  ring  nowhere touching  inclined to the ecliptic   

when robert hooke discovered hooke s law in       he first published it in anagram form   ceiiinosssttuv   for  ut tensio  sic vis   latin   as the tension  so the force   

in a related use  from       british naturalist sir peter scott coined the scientific term  nessiteras rhombopteryx   greek   the monster  or wonder  of ness with the diamond shaped fin   for the apocryphal loch ness monster  shortly afterwards  several london newspapers pointed out that  nessiteras rhombopteryx  anagrams into  monster hoax by sir peter s   however  robert rines  who previously made two underwater photographs allegedly showing the monster  countered with the fact that they can also be arranged into  yes  both pix are monsters  r  

anagrams are connected to pseudonyms  by the fact that they may conceal or reveal  or operate somewhere in between like a mask that can establish identity  for example  jim morrison used an anagram of his name in the doors song  l a  woman   calling himself  mr  mojo risin    the use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names  as happened in the   th century when edward cave wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the house of commons  in a genre such as farce or parody  anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect 

pseudonyms adopted by authors are sometimes transposed forms of their names  thus  calvinus  becomes  alcuinus   here v   u  or  fran  ois rabelais     alcofribas nasier   the name  voltaire  of fran  ois marie arouet fits this pattern  and is allowed to be an anagram of  arouet  l e  j eune    u   v  j   i  that is   arouet the younger   other examples include


several of these are  imperfect anagrams   letters having been left out in some cases for the sake of easy pronunciation 

anagrams used for titles afford scope for some types of wit  examples 

in hebrew  the name  gernot zippe                         the inventor of the zippe type centrifuge  is an anagram of the word  centrifuge                       

anagrams are in themselves a recreational activity  but they also make up part of many other games  puzzles and game shows  the jumble is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the united states requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution  cryptic crossword puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues  usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like  confused  or  in disarray   an example would be  businessman burst into tears    letters    the solution   stationer   is an anagram of  into tears   the letters of which have  burst  out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of  businessman  

numerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as a basic skill  some examples 

multiple anagramming is a technique used to solve some kinds of cryptograms  such as a permutation cipher  a transposition cipher  and the jefferson disk  solutions may be computationally found using a jumble algorithm 

sometimes  it is possible to  see  anagrams in words  unaided by tools  though the more letters involved the more difficult this becomes  anagram dictionaries could also be used  computer programs  known as  anagram servers   anagram solvers  or  anagrammers   offer a much faster route to creating anagrams  and a large number of these programs are available on the internet 

the program or server carries out an exhaustive search of a database of words  to produce a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase using a jumble algorithm  some programs  such as  lexpert   restrict to one word answers  many anagram servers  for example  the words oracle  can control the search results  by excluding or including certain words  limiting the number or length of words in each anagram  or limiting the number of results  anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games  the disadvantage of computer anagram solvers  especially when applied to multi word anagrams  is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating  they usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations  some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often  this approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations 

some anagrammatists indicate the method they used  anagrams constructed without aid of a computer are noted as having been done  manually  or  by hand   those made by utilizing a computer may be noted  by machine  or  by computer   or may indicate the name of the computer program  using  anagram genius   

there are also a few  natural  instances  english words unconsciously created by switching letters around  the french  chaise longue    long chair   became the american  chaise lounge  by metathesis  transposition of letters and or sounds   it has also been speculated that the english  curd  comes from the latin  crudus    raw    similarly  the ancient english word for bird was  brid  

an animated anagram displays the letters of a word or phrase moving into their new positions  traditionally  animators constructed animated gif images by manually crafting each of the frames  it s now possible to create anagram animations automatically with the animation service from the internet anagram server 





anadyr river

anadyr    is a river in the far northeast siberia which flows into anadyr bay of the bering sea and drains much of the interior of chukotka autonomous okrug  its basin corresponds to the anadyrsky district of chukotka 

the anadyr is long and has a basin of   it is frozen from october to late may and has a maximum flow in june with the snowmelt  it is navigable in small boats for about to near markovo  west of markovo it is in the anadyr highlands  moderate mountains and valleys with a few trees  and east of markovo it moves into the anadyr lowlands  very flat treeless tundra with lakes and bogs   the drop from markovo to the sea is less than  

it rises at about     n latitude and      e longitude near the headwaters of the maly anyuy river  flows southwest receiving the waters of the yablon and eropol rivers  turns east and passes markvovo and the old site of anadyrsk  turns north and east and receives the mayn river from the south  thereby encircling the lebediny zakaznik  turns northeast to receive the belaya river  chukotka  from the north  turns southeast past the ust tanyurer zakaznik and receives the tanyurer river from the north  at lake krasnoye  it turns east and flows into the onemen bay of the anadyr estuary  if the onemen bay is considered part of the river  it also receives the velikaya river  chukotka  from the south and the kanchalan river from the north 

its basin is surrounded by  north  amguyema river and palyavaam river   northwest  bolshoy anyuy river and the oloy branch of the omolon river and  southwest  penzhina river 

in      semyon dezhnev reached the mouth of the anadyr after being shipwrecked on the coast  in      he went upriver and built winter quarters at anadyrsk  for the next     years the anadyr was the main route from the arctic to the pacific and kamchatka  in the   th century  the anadyr was described by the polar explorer dmitry laptev 

the country through which it passes is thinly populated  and is dominated by tundra  with a rich variety of plant life  much of the region has beautiful landscapes  dominated by often spectacular  rugged mountains  for nine months of the year the ground is covered with snow  and the frozen rivers become navigable roads  george kennan  an american working on the western union telegraph expedition in the late     s  found that dog sled travel on the lower anadyr was limited by lack of firewood 

reindeer  upon which the local inhabitants subsisted  were once found in considerable numbers  but the domestic reindeer population has collapsed dramatically since the reorganization and privatization of state run collective farms beginning in       as herds of domestic reindeer have declined  herds of wild caribou have increased 

there are ten species of salmon inhabiting the anadyr river basin  every year  on the last sunday in april  there is an ice fishing competition in the frozen estuarine waters of the anadyr river s mouth  this festival is locally known as korfest 

the area is a summering place for a number of migratory birds including brent geese  eurasian wigeons  and the pintails of california

ammonia

ammonia is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen with the formula nh  the simplest pnictogen hydride  ammonia is a colourless gas with a characteristic pungent smell  it is a common nitrogenous waste  particularly among aquatic organisms  and it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilizers  ammonia  either directly or indirectly  is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceutical products and is used in many commercial cleaning products  it is mainly collected by downward displacement of both air and water  ammonia is named for the ammonians  worshipers of the egyptian god amun  who used ammonium chloride in their rituals 

although common in nature and in wide use  ammonia is both caustic and hazardous in its concentrated form  it is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the united states  and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce  store  or use it in significant quantities 

the global industrial production of ammonia in      was     million tonnes  a     increase over the      global industrial production of     million tonnes  industrial ammonia is sold either as ammonia liquor  usually     ammonia in water  or as pressurized or refrigerated anhydrous liquid ammonia transported in tank cars or cylinders 

nh boils at at a pressure of one atmosphere  so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature  household ammonia or ammonium hydroxide is a solution of nh in water  the concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the baum   scale  density   with    degrees baum    about      by weight  ammonia at   being the typical high concentration commercial product 

ammonia is a chemical found in trace quantities in nature  being produced from nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter  ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater  whereas ammonium chloride  sal ammoniac   and ammonium sulfate are found in volcanic districts  crystals of ammonium bicarbonate have been found in patagonian guano  the kidneys secrete ammonia to neutralize excess acid  ammonium salts are found distributed through fertile soil and in seawater 

ammonia is also found throughout the solar system on mars  jupiter  saturn  uranus  neptune  and pluto  among other places  on smaller  icy planets such as pluto  ammonia can act as a geologically important antifreeze  as a mixture of water and ammonia can have a melting point as low as if the ammonia concentration is high enough and thus allow such planets to retain internal oceans and active geology at a far lower temperature than would be possible with water alone  substances containing ammonia  or those that are similar to it  are called  ammoniacal  

ammonia is a colourless gas with a characteristic pungent smell  it is lighter than air  its density being       times that of air  it is easily liquefied due to the strong hydrogen bonding between molecules  the liquid boils at   and freezes at to white crystals 

ammonia may be conveniently deodorized by reacting it with either sodium bicarbonate or acetic acid  both of these reactions form an odourless ammonium salt 





the ammonia molecule has a trigonal pyramidal shape as predicted by the valence shell electron pair repulsion theory  vsepr theory  with an experimentally determined bond angle of          the central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom  this gives a total of eight electrons  or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally  three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs  which leaves one lone pair of electrons  the lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs  therefore the bond angle is not          as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement  but          the nitrogen atom in the molecule has a lone electron pair  which makes ammonia a base  a proton acceptor  this shape gives the molecule a dipole moment and makes it polar  the molecule s polarity  and especially  its ability to form hydrogen bonds  makes ammonia highly miscible with water  ammonia is moderately basic  a     m aqueous solution has a ph of      and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral  ph             of the ammonia molecules are protonated  temperature and salinity also affect the proportion of nh  the latter has the shape of a regular tetrahedron and is isoelectronic with methane 

the ammonia molecule readily undergoes nitrogen inversion at room temperature  a useful analogy is an umbrella turning itself inside out in a strong wind  the energy barrier to this inversion is      kj mol  and the resonance frequency is       ghz  corresponding to microwave radiation of a wavelength of        cm  the absorption at this frequency was the first microwave spectrum to be observed 

one of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its basicity  ammonia is considered to be a weak base  it combines with acids to form salts  thus with hydrochloric acid it forms ammonium chloride  sal ammoniac   with nitric acid  ammonium nitrate  etc  perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry hydrogen chloride  moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction  as a demonstration experiment  opened bottles of concentrated ammonia and hydrochloric acid produce clouds of ammonium chloride  which seem to appear  out of nothing  as the salt forms where the two diffusing clouds of molecules meet  somewhere between the two bottles 

the salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the and all contain the ammonium ion  nh  

although ammonia is well known as a weak base  it can also act as an extremely weak acid  it is a protic substance and is capable of formation of amides  which contain the nh ion   for example  lithium dissolves in liquid ammonia to give a solution of lithium amide 

like water  ammonia undergoes molecular autoionisation to form its acid and base conjugates 

ammonia often functions as a weak base  so it has some buffering ability  shifts in ph will cause more or fewer ammonium cations    and amide anions    to be present in solution  at standard pressure and temperature  k          

the combustion of ammonia to nitrogen and water is exothermic 

the standard enthalpy change of combustion     h     expressed per mole of ammonia and with condensation of the water formed  is            kj mol  dinitrogen is the thermodynamic product of combustion  all nitrogen oxides are unstable with respect to n and o  which is the principle behind the catalytic converter  nitrogen oxides can be formed as kinetic products in the presence of appropriate catalysts  a reaction of great industrial importance in the production of nitric acid 

a subsequent reaction leads to no

the combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst  such as platinum gauze or warm chromium iii  oxide   because the temperature of the flame is usually lower than the ignition temperature of the ammonia   air mixture  the flammable range of ammonia in air is          

in organic chemistry  ammonia can act as a nucleophile in substitution reactions  amines can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with alkyl halides  although the resulting  nh group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts  an excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution and neutralises the hydrogen halide formed  methylamine is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with chloromethane  and the reaction of ammonia with   bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare racemic alanine in     yield  ethanolamine is prepared by a ring opening reaction with ethylene oxide  the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce diethanolamine and triethanolamine 

amides can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with carboxylic acid derivatives  acyl chlorides are the most reactive  but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the hydrogen chloride formed  esters and anhydrides also react with ammonia to form amides  ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be dehydrated to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present  temperatures of              c are required 

the hydrogen in ammonia is capable of replacement by metals  thus  magnesium burns in the gas with the formation of magnesium nitride mgn  and when the gas is passed over heated sodium or potassium  sodamide  nanh  and potassamide  knh  are formed  where necessary in substitutive nomenclature  iupac recommendations prefer the name  azane  to ammonia  hence chloramine would be named  chloroazane  in substitutive nomenclature  not  chloroammonia  

pentavalent ammonia is known as    amine  or more commonly  ammonium hydride  this crystalline solid is only stable under high pressure and decomposes back into trivalent ammonia and hydrogen gas at normal conditions  this substance was once investigated as a possible solid rocket fuel in      

ammonia can act as a ligand in transition metal complexes  it is a pure    donor  in the middle of the spectrochemical series  and shows intermediate hard soft behaviour  for historical reasons  ammonia is named ammine in the nomenclature of coordination compounds  some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper ii    cu nh  ho     a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to a solution of copper ii  salts  tetraamminediaquacopper ii  hydroxide is known as schweizer s reagent  and has the remarkable ability to dissolve cellulose  diamminesilver i    ag nh    is the active species in tollens  reagent  formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides  silver chloride  agcl  is soluble in dilute   m  ammonia solution  silver bromide  agbr  is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution  whereas silver iodide  agi  is insoluble in aqueous ammonia 

ammine complexes of chromium iii  were known in the late   th century  and formed the basis of alfred werner s revolutionary theory on the structure of coordination compounds  werner noted only two isomers   fac   and  mer    of the complex  crcl nh   could be formed  and concluded the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the vertices of an octahedron  this proposal has since been confirmed by x ray crystallography 

an ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more acidic than a free ammonia molecule  although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare  one example is the calomel reaction  where the resulting amidomercury ii  compound is highly insoluble 

ammonia and ammonium salts can be readily detected  in very minute traces  by the addition of nessler s solution  which gives a distinct yellow colouration in the presence of the slightest trace of ammonia or ammonium salts  the amount of ammonia in ammonium salts can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with sodium or potassium hydroxide  the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard sulfuric acid and the excess of acid then determined volumetrically  or the ammonia may be absorbed in hydrochloric acid and the ammonium chloride so formed precipitated as ammonium hexachloroplatinate   nh ptcl 

sulfur sticks are burnt to detect small leaks in industrial ammonia refrigeration systems  larger quantities can be detected by warming the salts with a caustic alkali or with quicklime  when the characteristic smell of ammonia will be at once apparent  ammonia is an irritant and irritation increases with concentration  the permissible exposure limit is     ppm  and lethal above      ppm  higher concentrations are hardly detected by conventional detectors  the type of detector is chosen according to the sensitivity required  e g  semiconductor  catalytic  electrochemical   holographic sensors have been proposed for detecting concentrations up to       in volume 

ammoniacal nitrogen  nh n  is a measure commonly used for testing the quantity of ammonium ions  derived naturally from ammonia  and returned to ammonia via organic processes  in water or waste liquids  it is a measure used mainly for quantifying values in waste treatment and water purification systems  as well as a measure of the health of natural and man made water reserves  it is measured in units of mg l  milligram per litre  

the ancient greek historian herodotus mentioned that there were outcrops of salt in an area of libya that was inhabited by a people called the  ammonians   now  the siwa oasis in northwestern egypt  where salt lakes still exist   the greek geographer strabo also mentioned the salt from this region  however  the ancient authors dioscorides  apicius  arrian  synesius  and a  tius of amida described this salt as forming clear crystals that could be used for cooking and that were essentially rock salt   hammoniacus sal  appears in the writings of pliny  although it is not known whether the term is identical with the more modern sal ammoniac  ammonium chloride  

the fermentation of urine by bacteria produces a solution of ammonia  hence fermented urine was used in classical antiquity to wash cloth and clothing  to remove hair from hides in preparation for tanning  to serve as a mordant in dying cloth  and to remove rust from iron 

in the form of sal ammoniac               nushadir   ammonia was important to the muslim alchemists as early as the  th century  first mentioned by the persian arab chemist j  bir ibn hayy  n  and to the european alchemists since the   th century  being mentioned by albertus magnus  it was also used by dyers in the middle ages in the form of fermented urine to alter the colour of vegetable dyes  in the   th century  basilius valentinus showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkalis on sal ammoniac  at a later period  when sal ammoniac was obtained by distilling the hooves and horns of oxen and neutralizing the resulting carbonate with hydrochloric acid  the name  spirit of hartshorn  was applied to ammonia 

gaseous ammonia was first isolated by joseph black in      by reacting  sal ammoniac   ammonium chloride  with  calcined magnesia   magnesium oxide   it was isolated again by peter woulfe in       by carl wilhelm scheele in      and by joseph priestley in      and was termed by him  alkaline air   eleven years later in       claude louis berthollet ascertained its composition 

the haber   bosch process to produce ammonia from the nitrogen in the air was developed by fritz haber and carl bosch in      and patented in       it was first used on an industrial scale in germany during world war i  following the allied blockade that cut off the supply of nitrates from chile  the ammonia was used to produce explosives to sustain war efforts 

before the availability of natural gas  hydrogen as a precursor to ammonia production was produced via the electrolysis of water or using the chloralkali process 

with the advent of the steel industry in the   th century  ammonia became a byproduct of the production of coking coal 

globally  approximately      as of       of ammonia is used as fertilizers either as its salts  solutions or anhydrously  when applied to soil  it helps provide increased yields of crops such as maize and wheat      of agricultural nitrogen applied in the usa is in the form of anhydrous ammonia and worldwide     million tonnes are applied each year 

ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen containing compounds  virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia  an important derivative is nitric acid  this key material is generated via the ostwald process by oxidation of ammonia with air over a platinum catalyst at      atm  nitric oxide is an intermediate in this conversion 
nitric acid is used for the production of fertilizers  explosives  and many organonitrogen compounds 

ammonia is also used to make the following compounds 

ammonia can also be used to make compounds in reactions which are not specifically named  examples of such compounds include  ammonium perchlorate  ammonium nitrate  formamide  dinitrogen tetroxide  alprazolam  ethanolamine  ethyl carbamate  hexamethylenetetramine  and ammonium bicarbonate 

household ammonia is a solution of nh in water  i e   ammonium hydroxide  used as a general purpose cleaner for many surfaces  because ammonia results in a relatively streak free shine  one of its most common uses is to clean glass  porcelain and stainless steel  it is also frequently used for cleaning ovens and soaking items to loosen baked on grime  household ammonia ranges in concentration by weight from   to     ammonia  united states manufacturers of cleaning products are required to provide the product s material safety data sheet which lists the concentration used 

solutions of ammonia ranging from     to     are used in the fermentation industry as a source of nitrogen for microorganisms and to adjust ph during fermentation 

as early as in       it was known that ammonia was  strongly antiseptic     it requires     grams per litre to preserve beef tea   in one study  anhydrous ammonia destroyed         of zoonotic bacteria in   types of animal feed  but not silage  anhydrous ammonia is currently used commercially to reduce or eliminate microbial contamination of beef 
lean finely textured beef in the beef industry is made from fatty beef trimmings  c           fat  by removing the fat using heat and centrifugation  then treating it with ammonia to kill  e  coli   the process was deemed effective and safe by the us department of agriculture based on a study that found that the treatment reduces  e  coli  to undetectable levels  there have been safety concerns about the process as well as consumer complaints about the taste and smell of beef treated at optimal levels of ammonia  the level of ammonia in any final product has not come close to toxic levels to humans 

because of ammonia s vaporization properties  it is a useful refrigerant  it was commonly used before the popularisation of chlorofluorocarbons  freons   anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications and hockey rinks because of its high energy efficiency and low cost  it suffers from the disadvantage of toxicity  which restricts its domestic and small scale use  along with its use in modern vapor compression refrigeration it is used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in absorption refrigerators  the kalina cycle  which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants  depends on the wide boiling range of the ammonia   water mixture  ammonia coolant is also used in the s  radiator aboard the international space station in two loops which are used to regulate the internal temperature and enable temperature dependent experiments 

the potential importance of ammonia as a refrigerant has increased with the discovery that vented cfcs and hfcs are extremely potent and stable greenhouse gases  the contribution to the greenhouse effect of cfcs and hfcs in current use  if vented  would match that of all co in the atmosphere 

ammonia is used to scrub so from the burning of fossil fuels  and the resulting product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer  ammonia neutralizes the nitrogen oxide  no  pollutants emitted by diesel engines  this technology  called scr  selective catalytic reduction   relies on a vanadia based catalyst 
ammonia may be used to mitigate gaseous spills of phosgene 

the raw energy density of liquid ammonia is      mj l  which is about a third that of diesel  although it can be used as a fuel  for a number of reasons this has never been common or widespread  in addition to direct utilization of ammonia as a fuel in combustion engines  there is also the opportunity to convert ammonia back to hydrogen  where it can be used to power hydrogen fuel cells or directly within high temperature fuel cells 

ammonia engines or ammonia motors  using ammonia as a working fluid  have been proposed and occasionally used  the principle is similar to that used in a fireless locomotive  but with ammonia as the working fluid  instead of steam or compressed air  ammonia engines were used experimentally in the   th century by goldsworthy gurney in the uk and the st  charles avenue streetcar line in new orleans in the     s and     s  and during world war ii ammonia was used to power buses in belgium 

ammonia is sometimes proposed as a practical alternative to fossil fuel for internal combustion engines  its high octane rating of     and low flame temperature allows the use of high compression ratios without a penalty of high nox production    since ammonia contains no carbon  its combustion cannot produce carbon monoxide  hydrocarbons or soot 

however ammonia cannot be easily used in existing otto cycle engines because of its very narrow flammability range  and there are also other barriers to widespread automobile usage  in terms of raw ammonia supplies  plants would have to be built to increase production levels  requiring significant capital and energy sources  although it is the second most produced chemical  the scale of ammonia production is a small fraction of world petroleum usage  it could be manufactured from renewable energy sources  as well as coal or nuclear power  the    mw rjukan dam in telemark  norway produced ammonia for many years from       providing fertilizer for much of europe 

despite this  several tests have been done  in       a canadian company converted a      chevrolet impala to operate using ammonia as fuel  in       a university of michigan pickup powered by ammonia drove from detroit to san francisco as part of a demonstration  requiring only one fill up in wyoming 

compared to hydrogen as a fuel  ammonia is much more energy efficient  and hydrogen could be produced  stored  and delivered at a much lower cost as ammonia rather than as compressed and or cryogenic hydrogen  the conversion of ammonia to hydrogen via the sodium amide process  either as a catalyst for combustion or as fuel for a proton exchange membrane fuel cell  is another possibility  conversion to hydrogen would allow the storage of hydrogen at nearly    wt  compared to     for gaseous hydrogen under pressure 

rocket engines have also been fueled by ammonia  the reaction motors xlr   rocket engine that powered the hypersonic research aircraft used liquid ammonia  although not as powerful as other fuels  it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine  and its density approximately matches the density of the oxidizer  liquid oxygen  which simplified the aircraft s design 

ammonia  as the vapor released by smelling salts  has found significant use as a respiratory stimulant  ammonia is commonly used in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine through a birch reduction  the birch method of making methamphetamine is dangerous because the alkali metal and liquid ammonia are both extremely reactive  and the temperature of liquid ammonia makes it susceptible to explosive boiling when reactants are added 

liquid ammonia is used for treatment of cotton materials  giving properties like mercerisation  using alkalis  in particular  it is used for prewashing of wool 

at standard temperature and pressure  ammonia is less dense than atmosphere and has approximately        of the lifting power of hydrogen or helium  ammonia has sometimes been used to fill weather balloons as a lifting gas  because of its relatively high boiling point  compared to helium and hydrogen   ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an airship to reduce lift and add ballast  and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast  

ammonia has been used to darken quartersawn white oak in arts   crafts and mission style furniture  ammonia fumes react with the natural tannins in the wood and cause it to change colours 

ammonia can be manufactured from solar energy  air and water  this is an efficient way to package hydrogen into a chemical that is much cheaper to store and transport than pure hydrogen be it as gas or as liquid  in fact  per volume ammonia holds more hydrogen than does liquid hydrogen  ammonia may be the key to overcome not only the daily but also the seasonal fluctuations of renewable energy sources 

this approach will solve many of the problems foreseen for the proposed hydrogen economy  that instead could be replaced by an ammonia economy  essentially still a hydrogen economy 

in early august       scientists from australia   s commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation  csiro  announced the success of developing a process to release hydrogen from ammonia and harvest that at ultra high purity as a fuel for cars  this uses a special membrane  two demonstration fuel cell vehicles have the technology  a hyundai nexo and toyota mirai 

small scale  intermittent production of ammonia  for local agricultural use  may be a viable substitute for electrical grid attachment as a sink for power generated by wind turbines in isolated rural installations  such production would necessarily depend on new  efficiently catalyzed methods to emerge from laboratories 

the u  s  occupational safety and health administration  osha  has set a    minute exposure limit for gaseous ammonia of    ppm by volume in the environmental air and an   hour exposure limit of    ppm by volume  niosh recently reduced the idlh from     to     based on recent more conservative interpretations of original research in       idlh  immediately dangerous to life and health  is the level to which a healthy worker can be exposed for    minutes without suffering irreversible health effects  other organizations have varying exposure levels  u s  navy standards  u s  bureau of ships       maximum allowable concentrations  macs  continuous exposure     days      ppm     hour      ppm ammonia vapour has a sharp  irritating  pungent odour that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure  the average odour threshold is   ppm  well below any danger or damage  exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death  although ammonia is regulated in the united states as a non flammable gas  it still meets the definition of a material that is toxic by inhalation and requires a hazardous safety permit when transported in quantities greater than        l        gallons   household products containing ammonia  i e   windex  should never be used in conjunction with products containing bleach  as the resulting chemical reaction produces highly toxic fumes 

liquid ammonia is dangerous because it is hygroscopic and because it can freeze flesh  see gas carrier health effects of specific cargoes carried on gas carriers for more information 

the toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals  as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build up in the bloodstream  ammonia is converted to carbamoyl phosphate by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase  and then enters the urea cycle to be either incorporated into amino acids or excreted in the urine  fish and amphibians lack this mechanism  as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion  ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals  and for this reason it is classified as  dangerous for the environment  

ammonia is a constituent of tobacco smoke 

ammonia is present in coking wastewater streams  as a liquid by product of the production of coke from coal  in some cases  the ammonia is discharged to the marine environment where it acts as a pollutant  the whyalla steelworks in south australia is one example of a coke producing facility which discharges ammonia into marine waters 

ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries  excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body ph of the exposed organism  tolerance varies among fish species  at lower concentrations  around       mg l  un ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates  reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases  exposed to excess ammonia  fish may suffer loss of equilibrium  hyper excitability  increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate  at concentrations exceeding      mg l  ammonia causes gill and tissue damage  extreme lethargy  convulsions  coma  and death  experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from     to      mg l 

during winter  when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock  ammonia levels can be higher  lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present  within an aquaculture environment  especially at large scale  there is no fast acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels  prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems  the surrounding environment 

similar to propane  anhydrous ammonia boils below room temperature when at atmospheric pressure  a storage vessel capable of is suitable to contain the liquid  ammonium compounds should never be allowed to come in contact with bases  unless in an intended and contained reaction   as dangerous quantities of ammonia gas could be released 

solutions of ammonia          by weight  are used as household cleaners  particularly for glass  these solutions are irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes  respiratory and digestive tracts   and to a lesser extent the skin  caution should be used that the chemical is never mixed into any liquid containing bleach  as a poisonous gas may result  mixing with chlorine containing products or strong oxidants  such as household bleach  can lead to hazardous compounds such as chloramines 

the hazards of ammonia solutions depend on the concentration   dilute  ammonia solutions are usually         by weight      by weight  a      by weight  solution has a density of       g cm  and a solution that has a lower density will be more concentrated  the european union classification of ammonia solutions is given in the table 

the ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract  and these solutions should only be handled in a fume hood  saturated              see  properties  solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather  and the bottle should be opened with care  this is not usually a problem for               solutions 

ammonia solutions should not be mixed with halogens  as toxic and or explosive products are formed  prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with silver  mercury or iodide salts can also lead to explosive products  such mixtures are often formed in qualitative inorganic analysis  and should be lightly acidified but not concentrated      w v  before disposal once the test is completed 

anhydrous ammonia is classified as toxic  t  and dangerous for the environment  n   the gas is flammable  autoignition temperature         c  and can form explosive mixtures with air             the permissible exposure limit  pel  in the united states is     ppm      mg m   while the idlh concentration is estimated at      ppm  repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas  normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than     ppm  but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of      ppm  anhydrous ammonia corrodes copper  and zinc containing alloys  and so brass fittings should not be used for handling the gas  liquid ammonia can also attack rubber and certain plastics 

ammonia reacts violently with the halogens  nitrogen triiodide  a primary high explosive  is formed when ammonia comes in contact with iodine  ammonia causes the explosive polymerisation of ethylene oxide  it also forms explosive fulminating compounds with compounds of gold  silver  mercury  germanium or tellurium  and with stibine  violent reactions have also been reported with acetaldehyde  hypochlorite solutions  potassium ferricyanide and peroxides 

because of its many uses  ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals  dozens of chemical plants worldwide produce ammonia  consuming more than    of all man made power  ammonia production is a significant component of the world energy budget  the usgs reports global ammonia production in      was     million tonnes  china accounted for       of that  increasingly from coal as part of urea synthesis   followed by russia at       india at       and the united states at       about     of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops  as of      the global production of ammonia produced from natural gas using the steam reforming process was    percent 

before the start of world war i  most ammonia was obtained by the dry distillation of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products  including camel dung  where it was distilled by the reduction of nitrous acid and nitrites with hydrogen  in addition  it was produced by the distillation of coal  and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by alkaline hydroxides such as quicklime  the salt most generally used being the chloride  sal ammoniac  thus 

hydrogen for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically by using the water gas reaction followed by the water gas shift reaction  produced by passing steam through red hot coke  to give a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases  followed by removal of the carbon dioxide  washing  the gas mixture with water under pressure     or by using other sources like coal or coke gasification 

modern ammonia producing plants depend on industrial hydrogen production to react with atmospheric nitrogen using a magnetite catalyst or over a promoted fe catalyst under high pressure    and temperature         c  to form anhydrous liquid ammonia  this step is known as the ammonia synthesis loop  also referred to as the haber   bosch process  

hydrogen required for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically using other sources like coal or coke gasification or less economically from the electrolysis of water into oxygen   hydrogen and other alternatives that are presently impractical for large scale 
at one time  most of europe s ammonia was produced from the hydro plant at vemork  via the electrolysis route  various renewable energy electricity sources are also potentially applicable 

as a sustainable alternative to the relatively inefficient electrolysis  hydrogen can be generated from organic wastes  such as biomass or food industry waste  using catalytic reforming  this releases hydrogen from carbonaceous substances at only          of energy used by electrolysis and may lead to hydrogen being produced from municipal wastes at below zero cost  allowing for the tipping fees and efficient catalytic reforming  such as cold plasma   catalytic  thermal  reforming is possible in small  distributed  even mobile  plants  to take advantage of low value  stranded biomass biowaste or natural gas deposits  conversion of such wastes into ammonia solves the problem of hydrogen storage  as hydrogen can be released economically from ammonia on demand  without the need for high pressure or cryogenic storage 

it is also easier to store ammonia onboard vehicles than to store hydrogen  as ammonia is less flammable than petrol or lpg 

there is significant recent progress in synthesizing ammonia more efficiently from h and n than with the haber process  in       masaaki kitano  and   co authors   working with an organic ruthenium catalyst  demonstrated  ammonia synthesis using a stable electride as an electron donor and reversible hydrogen store   in january       yutong gong  and    co authors  demonstrated  ternary intermetallic lacosi as a catalyst for n activation   an equally efficient production process  not dependent on rare metal  in july       xiaoqian wang  and    co authors  demonstrated  atomically dispersed au   catalyst towards efficient electrochemical synthesis of ammonia   an even more efficient process 

for small scale laboratory synthesis  one can heat urea and ca oh 

liquid ammonia is the best known and most widely studied nonaqueous ionising solvent  its most conspicuous property is its ability to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured  electrically conductive solutions containing solvated electrons  apart from these remarkable solutions  much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions  comparison of the physical properties of nh with those of water shows nh has the lower melting point  boiling point  density  viscosity  dielectric constant and electrical conductivity  this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in nh and because such bonding cannot form cross linked networks  since each nh molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each ho molecule  the ionic self dissociation constant of liquid nh at          c is about    mol  l 

liquid ammonia is an ionising solvent  although less so than water  and dissolves a range of ionic compounds  including many nitrates  nitrites  cyanides  thiocyanates  metal cyclopentadienyl complexes and metal bis trimethylsilyl amides  most ammonium salts are soluble and act as acids in liquid ammonia solutions  the solubility of halide salts increases from fluoride to iodide  a saturated solution of ammonium nitrate  divers  solution  named after edward divers  contains       mol solute per mole of ammonia and has a vapour pressure of less than    bar even at  

liquid ammonia will dissolve the alkali metals and other electropositive metals such as magnesium  calcium  strontium  barium  europium and ytterbium  at low concentrations         mol l   deep blue solutions are formed  these contain metal cations and solvated electrons  free electrons that are surrounded by a cage of ammonia molecules 

these solutions are very useful as strong reducing agents  at higher concentrations  the solutions are metallic in appearance and in electrical conductivity  at low temperatures  the two types of solution can coexist as phases 

the range of thermodynamic stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow  as the potential for oxidation to dinitrogen   e     n    nh    e      nh   is only        v  in practice  both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow  this is particularly true of reducing solutions  the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days  slowly decomposing to the metal amide and dihydrogen  most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions  although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow  there is still a risk of explosion  particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts 

ammonia is both a metabolic waste and a metabolic input throughout the biosphere  it is an important source of nitrogen for living systems  although atmospheric nitrogen abounds  more than       few living creatures are capable of using this atmospheric nitrogen in its diatomic form  n gas  therefore  nitrogen fixation is required for the synthesis of amino acids  which are the building blocks of protein  some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter  others  such as nitrogen fixing legumes  benefit from symbiotic relationships with rhizobia that create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen 

in certain organisms  ammonia is produced from atmospheric nitrogen by enzymes called nitrogenases  the overall process is called nitrogen fixation  intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation  the scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme  which consists of an femos ensemble 

ammonia is also a metabolic product of amino acid deamination catalyzed by enzymes such as glutamate dehydrogenase    ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals  in humans  it is quickly converted to urea  which is much less toxic  particularly less basic  this urea is a major component of the dry weight of urine  most reptiles  birds  insects  and snails excrete uric acid solely as nitrogenous waste 

ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal physiology  it is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations  the liver converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the urea cycle  liver dysfunction  such as that seen in cirrhosis  may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood  hyperammonemia   likewise  defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle  such as ornithine transcarbamylase  lead to hyperammonemia  hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and coma of hepatic encephalopathy  as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and organic acidurias 

ammonia is important for normal animal acid base balance  after formation of ammonium from glutamine     ketoglutarate may be degraded to produce two molecules of bicarbonate  which are then available as buffers for dietary acids  ammonium is excreted in the urine  resulting in net acid loss  ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules  combine with a hydrogen ion  and thus allow for further acid excretion 

ammonium ions are a toxic waste product of metabolism in animals  in fish and aquatic invertebrates  it is excreted directly into the water  in mammals  sharks  and amphibians  it is converted in the urea cycle to urea  because it is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently  in birds  reptiles  and terrestrial snails  metabolic ammonium is converted into uric acid  which is solid  and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss 

ammonia has been detected in the atmospheres of the gas giant planets  including jupiter  along with other gases like methane  hydrogen  and helium  the interior of saturn may include frozen crystals of ammonia  it is naturally found on deimos and phobos     the two moons of mars 

ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in       based on microwave emissions from the direction of the galactic core  this was the first polyatomic molecule to be so detected 
the sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of molecular clouds  the relative intensity of the ammonia lines can be used to measure the temperature of the emitting medium 

the following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected 
the detection of triply deuterated ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce  it is thought that the low temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate 

since its interstellar discovery  nh has proved to be an invaluable spectroscopic tool in the study of the interstellar medium  with a large number of transitions sensitive to a wide range of excitation conditions  nh has been widely astronomically detected     its detection has been reported in hundreds of journal articles  listed below is a sample of journal articles that highlights the range of detectors that have been used to identify ammonia 

the study of interstellar ammonia has been important to a number of areas of research in the last few decades  some of these are delineated below and primarily involve using ammonia as an interstellar thermometer 

the interstellar abundance for ammonia has been measured for a variety of environments  the  nh   h  ratio has been estimated to range from    in small dark clouds up to    in the dense core of the orion molecular cloud complex  although a total of    total production routes have been proposed  the principal formation mechanism for interstellar nh is the reaction 

the rate constant   k   of this reaction depends on the temperature of the environment  with a value of         at    k  the rate constant was calculated from the formula   for the primary formation reaction  and   assuming an nh abundance of       and an electron abundance of    typical of molecular clouds  the formation will proceed at a rate of in a molecular cloud of total density  

all other proposed formation reactions have rate constants of between   and    orders of magnitude smaller  making their contribution to the abundance of ammonia relatively insignificant  as an example of the minor contribution other formation reactions play  the reaction 

has a rate constant of          assuming h densities of    and  nh   h  ratio of     this reaction proceeds at a rate of          more than   orders of magnitude slower than the primary reaction above 

some of the other possible formation reactions are 

there are     total proposed reactions leading to the destruction of nh  of these     were tabulated in extensive tables of the chemistry among c  n  and o compounds  a review of interstellar ammonia cites the following reactions as the principal dissociation mechanisms 

with rate constants of          and          respectively  the above equations      run at a rate of         and          respectively  these calculations assumed the given rate constants and abundances of  nh   h         h   h            hco   h           and total densities of  n        typical of cold  dense  molecular clouds  clearly  between these two primary reactions  equation    is the dominant destruction reaction  with a rate         times faster than equation     this is due to the relatively high abundance of h 

radio observations of nh from the effelsberg     m radio telescope reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components     a background ridge and an unresolved core  the background corresponds well with the locations previously detected co  the    m chilbolton telescope in england detected radio signatures of ammonia in h ii regions  hnho masers  h h objects  and other objects associated with star formation  a comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds 

microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including w  oh   orion a  w    w    and five sources in the galactic centre  the high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high density regions are common in the galaxy 

vla observations of nh in seven regions with high velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than     pc in l      s     and cepheus a  three individual condensations were detected in cepheus a  one of them with a highly elongated shape  they may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region 

extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the vla in ic      the hot gas has temperatures above    k  which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in co  nh was also monitored by vla toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact hii regions  g           g            g            and g            based upon temperature and density diagnostics  it is concluded that in general such clumps are probably the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact hii region 

absorption at      micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the becklin neugebauer object and probably in ngc      ir as well  this detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines 

a spectrum of the disk of jupiter was obtained from the kuiper airborne observatory  covering the     to      cm spectral range  analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze 

a total of     dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of  dense cores  by using the  j k          rotating inversion line of nh  in general  the cores are not spherically shaped  with aspect ratios ranging from     to      it is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars 

ammonia has been detected in the draco nebula and in one or possibly two molecular clouds  which are associated with the high latitude galactic infrared cirrus  the finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the population i metallicity b type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk 

by balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission  it is possible to construct a relation between excitation temperature and density  moreover  since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a   level system at low temperatures  this calculation is fairly simple  this premise can be applied to dark clouds  regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation  detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines   indicative not only of low temperatures  but also of a low level of inner cloud turbulence  line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous co observations  the ammonia observations were consistent with co measurements of rotation temperatures of     k  with this  densities can be determined  and have been calculated to range between    and    cm in dark clouds  mapping of nh gives typical clouds sizes of     pc and masses near   solar mass  these cold  dense cores are the sites of future star formation 

ultra compact hii regions are among the best tracers of high mass star formation  the dense material surrounding uchii regions is likely primarily molecular  since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed  ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material  since this molecular material can be spatially resolved  it is possible to constrain the heating ionising sources  temperatures  masses  and sizes of the regions  doppler shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars 

ammonia has been detected in external galaxies  and by simultaneously measuring several lines  it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies  line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm      k   originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc  this picture is consistent with the picture within our milky way galaxy   hot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred pc  giant molecular clouds  gmcs  








amethyst

amethyst is a violet variety of quartz  

the name comes from the koine greek                      amethystos  from       a     not  and                 methysko                methyo    intoxicate   a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness  the ancient greeks wore amethyst and carved drinking vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication 

amethyst is a semiprecious stone often used in jewelry and is the traditional birthstone for february 

amethyst is a purple variety of quartz  sio  and owes its violet color to irradiation  iron impurities  in some cases in conjunction with transition element impurities   and the presence of trace elements  which result in complex crystal lattice substitutions  the hardness of the mineral is the same as quartz  thus it is suitable for use in jewelry 

amethyst occurs in primary hues from a light pinkish violet to a deep purple  amethyst may exhibit one or both secondary hues  red and blue  the best varieties of amethyst can be found in siberia  sri lanka  brazil and the far east  the ideal grade is called  deep siberian  and has a primary purple hue of around           with          blue and  depending on the light source  red secondary hues     rose de france    is defined by its markedly light shade of the purple  reminiscent of a lavender lilac shade  these pale colors  were once considered undesirable but have recently become popular due to intensive marketing  

green quartz is sometimes incorrectly called green amethyst  which is a misnomer and not an appropriate name for the material  the proper terminology being prasiolite  other names for green quartz are vermarine or lime citrine 

of very variable intensity  the color of amethyst is often laid out in stripes parallel to the final faces of the crystal  one aspect in the art of lapidary involves correctly cutting the stone to place the color in a way that makes the tone of the finished gem homogeneous  often  the fact that sometimes only a thin surface layer of violet color is present in the stone or that the color is not homogeneous makes for a difficult cutting 

the color of amethyst has been demonstrated to result from substitution by irradiation of trivalent iron  fe  for silicon in the structure  in the presence of trace elements of large ionic radius  and  to a certain extent  the amethyst color can naturally result from displacement of transition elements even if the iron concentration is low  natural amethyst is dichroic in reddish violet and bluish violet  but when heated  turns yellow orange  yellow brown  or dark brownish and may resemble citrine  but loses its dichroism  unlike genuine citrine  when partially heated  amethyst can result in ametrine 

amethyst can fade in tone if overexposed to light sources and can be artificially darkened with adequate irradiation 

amethyst was used as a gemstone by the ancient egyptians and was largely employed in antiquity for intaglio engraved gems 

the greeks believed amethyst gems could prevent intoxication  while medieval european soldiers wore amethyst amulets as protection in battle in the belief that amethysts heal people and keep them cool headed  beads of amethyst were found in anglo saxon graves in england  anglican bishops wear an episcopal ring often set with an amethyst  an allusion to the description of the apostles as  not drunk  at pentecost in acts      

a large geode  or  amethyst grotto   from near santa cruz in southern brazil was presented at a      exhibition in d  sseldorf  germany 

in the   th century  the color of amethyst was attributed to the presence of manganese  however  since it can be greatly altered and even discharged by heat  the color was believed by some authorities to be from an organic source  ferric thiocyanate has been suggested  and sulfur was said to have been detected in the mineral 

synthetic  laboratory grown  amethyst is produced by a synthesis method called hydrothermal growth  which grows the crystals inside a high pressure autoclave 

synthetic amethyst is made to imitate the best quality amethyst  its chemical and physical properties are the same to that of natural amethyst and it can not be differentiated with absolute certainty without advanced gemmological testing  which is often cost prohibitive   there is one test based on  brazil law twinning   a form of quartz twinning where right and left hand quartz structures are combined in a single crystal  which can be used to identify synthetic amethyst rather easily  it is possible to synthesize twinned amethyst  but this type is not available in large quantities in the market 

single crystal quartz is very desirable in the industry  particularly for keeping the regular vibrations necessary for quartz movements in watches and clocks  which is where a lot of synthetic quartz is used 

treated amethyst is produced by gamma ray  x ray or electron beam irradiation of clear quartz  rock crystal  which has been first doped with ferric impurities  on exposure to heat  the irradiation effects can be partially cancelled and amethyst generally becomes yellow or even green  and much of the citrine  cairngorm  or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely  burnt amethyst  

the greek word  amethystos  may be translated as  not drunken   from greek  a     not     methustos    intoxicated   amethyst was considered to be a strong antidote against drunkenness  which is why wine goblets were often carved from it  in his poem  l amethyste  ou les amours de bacchus et d amethyste   amethyst or the loves of bacchus and amethyste   the french poet remy belleau               invented a myth in which bacchus  the god of intoxication  of wine  and grapes was pursuing a maiden named amethyste  who refused his affections  amethyste prayed to the gods to remain chaste  a prayer which the chaste goddess diana answered  transforming her into a white stone  humbled by amethyste s desire to remain chaste  bacchus poured wine over the stone as an offering  dyeing the crystals purple 

variations of the story include that dionysus had been insulted by a mortal and swore to slay the next mortal who crossed his path  creating fierce tigers to carry out his wrath  the mortal turned out to be a beautiful young woman  amethystos  who was on her way to pay tribute to artemis  her life was spared by artemis  who transformed the maiden into a statue of pure crystalline quartz to protect her from the brutal claws  dionysus wept tears of wine in remorse for his action at the sight of the beautiful statue  the god s tears then stained the quartz purple 

this myth and its variations are not found in classical sources  however  the titan rhea does present dionysus with an amethyst stone to preserve the wine drinker s sanity in historical text 

tibetans consider amethyst sacred to the buddha and make prayer beads from it  amethyst is considered the birthstone of february  in the middle ages  it was considered a symbol of royalty and used to decorate english regalia  in the old world  amethyst was considered one of the cardinal gems  in that it was one of the five gemstones considered precious above all others  until large deposits were found in brazil 

amethyst is produced in abundance from the state of minas gerais in brazil where it occurs in large geodes within volcanic rocks  many of the hollow agates of southwestern brazil and uruguay contain a crop of amethyst crystals in the interior  artigas  uruguay and neighboring brazilian state rio grande do sul are large world producers exceeding in quantity minas gerais  as well as mato grosso  espirito santo  bahia  and cear   states  all amethyst producers of importance in brazil 

it is also found and mined in south korea  the largest opencast amethyst vein in the world is in maissau  lower austria  much fine amethyst comes from russia  especially from near mursinka in the ekaterinburg district  where it occurs in drusy cavities in granitic rocks  many localities in south india yield amethyst  one of the largest global amethyst producers is zambia in southern africa with an annual production of about      tons 

amethyst occurs at many localities in the united states  among these may be mentioned  the mazatzal mountain region in gila and maricopa counties  arizona  red feather lakes  near ft collins  colorado  amethyst mountain  texas  yellowstone national park  delaware county  pennsylvania  haywood county  north carolina  deer hill and stow  maine and in the lake superior region of minnesota  wisconsin and michigan  amethyst is relatively common in the canadian provinces of ontario and nova scotia  the largest amethyst mine in north america is located in thunder bay  ontario 

up until the   th century  amethyst was included in the cardinal  or most valuable  gemstones  along with diamond  sapphire  ruby  and emerald   however  since the discovery of extensive deposits in locations such as brazil  it has lost most of its value 

collectors look for depth of color  possibly with red flashes if cut conventionally  as amethyst is readily available in large structures the value of the gem is not primarily defined by carat weight  this is different to most gemstones where the carat weight exponentially increases the value of the stone  the biggest factor in the value of amethyst is the color displayed

albertosaurus    meaning  alberta lizard   is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaurs that lived in western north america during the late cretaceous period  about     million years ago  the type species   a  sarcophagus   was apparently restricted in range to the modern day canadian province of alberta  after which the genus is named  scientists disagree on the content of the genus  with some recognizing  gorgosaurus libratus  as a second species  

as a tyrannosaurid   albertosaurus  was a bipedal predator with tiny  two fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large  sharp teeth  it may have been at the top of the food chain in its local ecosystem  while  albertosaurus  was large for a theropod  it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative  tyrannosaurus rex   growing nine to ten meters long and possibly weighing less than   metric tons 

since the first discovery in       fossils of more than    individuals have been recovered  providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of  albertosaurus  anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids  the discovery of    individuals at one site provides evidence of pack behaviour and allows studies of ontogeny and population biology  which are impossible with lesser known dinosaurs 

 albertosaurus  was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids  such as  tarbosaurus  and  tyrannosaurus   typical  albertosaurus  adults measured up to long  while rare individuals of great age could grow to be over long  several independent mass estimates  obtained by different methods  suggest that an adult  albertosaurus  weighed between      tonnes and     tonnes      tons  

 albertosaurus  shared a similar body appearance with all other tyrannosaurids  typically for a theropod   albertosaurus  was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and torso with a long tail  however  tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits  the hind limbs were long and ended in a four toed foot on which the first digit  called the hallux  was short and did not reach the ground  the third digit was longer than the rest   albertosaurus  may have been able to reach walking speeds of          km hour          mi hour   at least for the younger individuals  a high running speed is plausible 

two skin impressions from  albertosaurus  are known  both showing scales  one patch is found with some gastralic ribs and the impression of a long  unknown bone  indicating that the patch is from the belly  the scales are pebbly and gradually become larger and somewhat hexagonal in shape  also preserved are two larger feature scales  placed      cm apart from each other  another skin impression is from an unknown part of the body  these scales are small  diamond shaped and arranged in rows 

the massive skull of  albertosaurus   which was perched on a short  s shaped neck  was about long in the largest adults  wide openings in the skull  fenestrae  reduced the weight of the head while also providing space for muscle attachment and sensory organs  its long jaws contained  both sides combined     or more banana shaped teeth  larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth   gorgosaurus  at least     unlike most theropods   albertosaurus  and other tyrannosaurids were heterodont  with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth  the premaxillary teeth at the tip of the upper jaw  four per side  were much smaller than the rest  more closely packed  and d shaped in cross section  like with  tyrannosaurus   the maxillary  cheek  teeth of  albertosaurus  were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey  the bite force of  albertosaurus  was less formidable  however  with the maximum force  by the hind teeth  reaching       newtons  above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate 

william abler observed in      that  albertosaurus  tooth serrations resemble a crack in the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla  tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body  so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat  the tension could cause a purely crack like serration to spread through the tooth  however  the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger surface area  and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain  the presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering  guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to  as abler describes   impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity  to wood they work  the use of a drill to create an  ampulla  of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces  abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called  kerfs  and drilled holes was more than     stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions  unlike tyrannosaurs  ancient predators like phytosaurs and  dimetrodon  had no adaptations to prevent the crack like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding 

 albertosaurus  was named by henry fairfield osborn in a one page note at the end of his      description of  tyrannosaurus rex   the name honours alberta  the canadian province established the same year  in which the first remains were found  the generic name also incorporates the greek term                 sauros    lizard    the most common suffix in dinosaur names  the type species is  albertosaurus sarcophagus   the specific name is derived from ancient greek                        sarkophagos   meaning  flesh eating  and having the same etymology as the funeral container with which it shares its name  a combination of the greek words           sarx    flesh   and               phagein    to eat    more than    specimens of all ages are known to science 

the type specimen is a partial skull  collected in the summer of      from an outcrop of the horseshoe canyon formation alongside the red deer river  in alberta  this specimen  found on june          was recovered by an expedition of the geological survey of canada  led by the famous geologist joseph burr tyrrell  due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured  in       tyrrell s colleague thomas chesmer weston found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby  the two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species  laelaps incrassatus  by edward drinker cope in       although the name  laelaps  was preoccupied by a genus of mite and had been changed to  dryptosaurus  in      by othniel charles marsh  cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival marsh  however  lawrence lambe used the name  dryptosaurus incrassatus  instead of  laelaps incrassatus  when he described the remains in detail in      and       a combination first coined by oliver perry hay in       shortly later  osborn pointed out that  d  incrassatus  was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth  so the two horseshoe canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species  the horseshoe canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of  d  aquilunguis   type species of  dryptosaurus   so osborn created the new name  albertosaurus sarcophagus  for them in       he did not describe the remains in any great detail  citing lambe s complete description the year before  both specimens  the holotype cmn      and the paratype cmn       are stored in the canadian museum of nature in ottawa  by the early twenty first century  some concerns had arisen that  due to the damaged state of the holotype   albertosaurus  might be a  nomen dubium   a  dubious name  that could only be used for the type specimen itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it  however  in       thomas carr established that the holotype  the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or autapomorphy  the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the palatine bone  proving that  albertosaurus  was a valid taxon 

on    august       american paleontologist barnum brown discovered the remains of a large group of  albertosaurus  at another quarry alongside the red deer river  because of the large number of bones and the limited time available  brown s party did not collect every specimen  but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the bonebed  among the bones deposited in the american museum of natural history collections in new york city are seven sets of right metatarsals  along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size  this indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry  palaeontologist philip j  currie of the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology rediscovered the bonebed in      and resumed fieldwork at the site  which is now located inside dry island buffalo jump provincial park  further excavation from      to      turned up the remains of    more individuals of various ages  including a diminutive two year old and a very old individual estimated at over in length  none of these individuals are known from complete skeletons  and most are represented by remains in both museums  excavations continued until       when the minimum number of individuals present had been established at     on the basis of preserved elements that occur only once in a skeleton  and at    if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to ontogeny  a total of        albertosaurus  bones had been secured  the largest concentration of large theropod fossils known from the cretaceous 

in       barnum brown  during the second year of american museum of natural history operations in alberta  uncovered a fragmentary partial  albertosaurus  skull at the red deer river near tolman bridge  specimen amnh      

william parks described a new species in        albertosaurus arctunguis   based on a partial skeleton lacking the skull excavated by gus lindblad and ralph hornell near the red deer river in       but this species has been considered identical to  a  sarcophagus  since       parks  specimen  rom      is housed in the royal ontario museum in toronto 

between      and       no  albertosaurus  fossils were found at all  but  since the seventies  there has been a steady increase in the known material  apart from the dry island bonebed  six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in alberta and are housed in various canadian museums  specimens rtmp             found in      by amateur paleontologist maurice stefanuk  rtmp             found by stefanuk on    june       rtmp            december        rtmp                    rtmp                     and cmn        however  due to vandalism and accidents  no undamaged and complete skulls could be secured among these finds  fossils have also been reported from the american states of montana  new mexico  and wyoming  but these probably do not represent  a  sarcophagus  and may not even belong to the genus  albertosaurus  

in       paleontologist charles h  sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton from the slightly older dinosaur park formation in alberta  lawrence lambe named this dinosaur  gorgosaurus libratus  in       other specimens were later found in alberta and the us state of montana  finding  largely due to a lack of good  albertosaurus  skull material  no significant differences to separate the two taxa  dale russell declared the name  gorgosaurus  a junior synonym of  albertosaurus   which had been named first  and  g  libratus  was renamed  albertosaurus libratus  in       a species distinction was maintained because of the age difference  this addition extended the temporal range of the genus  albertosaurus  backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres 

in       philip j  currie  benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods  compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought  the decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary  as the two species are sister taxa  more closely related to each other than to any other species  recognizing this  currie nevertheless recommended that  albertosaurus  and  gorgosaurus  be retained as separate genera  as he concluded that they were no more similar than  daspletosaurus  and  tyrannosaurus   which are almost always separated  in addition  several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from alaska and new mexico  and currie suggested that the  albertosaurus   gorgosaurus  situation may be clarified once these are described fully  most authors have followed currie s recommendation  but some have not 

apart from  a  sarcophagus    a  arctunguis  and  a  libratus   several other species of  albertosaurus  have been named  all of these are today seen as younger synonyms of other species or as  nomina dubia   and are not assigned to  albertosaurus  

in       anatoly nikolaevich riabinin named  albertosaurus pericolosus  based on a tooth from china  that probably belonged to  tarbosaurus   in       friedrich von huene renamed  dryptosaurus incrassatus   not considered a  nomen dubium  by him  to  albertosaurus incrassatus   because he had identified  gorgosaurus  with  albertosaurus   in       russell also renamed  gorgosaurus sternbergi   matthew   brown       into  albertosaurus sternbergi  and  gorgosaurus lancensis   gilmore       into  albertosaurus lancensis   the former species is today seen as a juvenile form of  gorgosaurus libratus   the latter as either identical to  tyrannosaurus  or representing a separate genus  nanotyrannus   in       gregory s  paul based  albertosaurus megagracilis  on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton  specimen lacm        from the hell creek formation of montana  it was renamed  dinotyrannus  in       but is now thought to represent a juvenile  tyrannosaurus rex   also in       paul renamed  alectrosaurus olseni   gilmore       into  albertosaurus olseni   this has found no general acceptance  in        gorgosaurus novojilovi   maleev       was renamed by bryn mader and robert bradley as  albertosaurus novojilovi   today this is seen as a synonym of  tarbosaurus  

on two occasions  species based on valid  albertosaurus  material were reassigned to a different genus  in      william diller matthew renamed  a  sarcophagus  into  deinodon sarcophagus  and in      german paleontologist oskar kuhn renamed  a  arctunguis  into  deinodon arctunguis  

 albertosaurus  is a member of the theropod family tyrannosauridae  in the subfamily albertosaurinae  its closest relative is the slightly older  gorgosaurus libratus   sometimes called  albertosaurus libratus   see below   these two species are the only described albertosaurines  other undescribed species may exist  thomas holtz found  appalachiosaurus  to be an albertosaurine in       but his more recent unpublished work locates it just outside tyrannosauridae  in agreement with other authors 

the other major subfamily of tyrannosaurids is the tyrannosaurinae  which includes  daspletosaurus    tarbosaurus  and  tyrannosaurus   compared with these robust tyrannosaurines  albertosaurines had slender builds  with proportionately smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower leg  tibia  and feet  metatarsals and phalanges  

below is the cladogram of the tyrannosauridae based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by loewen  et al   in      

most age categories of  albertosaurus  are represented in the fossil record  using bone histology  the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined  allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species  the youngest known  albertosaurus  is a two year old discovered in the dry island bonebed  which would have weighed about    kilograms       lb  and measured slightly more than in length  the specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known  at    years of age  when specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph  an  s  shaped growth curve results  with the most rapid growth occurring in a four year period ending around the sixteenth year of life  a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids  the growth rate during this phase was per year  based on an adult      tonnes  other studies have suggested higher adult weights  this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate  but not the overall pattern  tyrannosaurids similar in size to  albertosaurus  had similar growth rates  although the much larger  tyrannosaurus rex  grew at almost five times this rate   per year  at its peak  the end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of sexual maturity in  albertosaurus   although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals  lives  sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and elephants  this pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds  which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing 

during growth  through thickening the tooth morphology changed so much that  had the association of young and adult skeletons on the dry island bonebed not proven they belonged to the same taxon  the teeth of juveniles would likely have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species 

most known  albertosaurus  individuals were aged    years or more at the time of death  juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons  mainly preservation bias  where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely to be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults  and collection bias  where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field  young  albertosaurus  are relatively large for juvenile animals  but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults  it has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history  rather than bias  and that fossils of juvenile  albertosaurus  are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did 

a hypothesis of  albertosaurus  life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers  but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction  after just two years  juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult  albertosaurus   and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals  this resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains  mortality rates doubled at age twelve  perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase  and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen  this elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood  perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation  including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources  and eventually  the ever increasing effects of senescence  the higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation  very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes  high infant mortality rates  followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity  with very few animals reaching maximum size  is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals  including elephants  african buffalo  and rhinoceros  the same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids  the comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis  but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role  especially since more than two thirds of all  albertosaurus  specimens are known from one locality 

the dry island bonebed discovered by barnum brown and his crew contains the remains of     albertosaurus   the most individuals found in one locality of any large cretaceous theropod  and the second most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the  allosaurus  assemblage at the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry in utah  the group seems to be composed of one very old adult  eight adults between    and    years old  seven sub adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between    and    years old  and six juveniles between the ages of   and    years  who had not yet reached the growth phase 

the near absence of herbivore remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the  albertosaurus  bonebed quarry led currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the la brea tar pits in california  and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time  currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour  other scientists are skeptical  observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought  flood or for other reasons 

there is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs  including ceratopsians and hadrosaurs  however  only rarely are so many dinosaurian predators found at the same site  small theropods like  deinonychus  and  coelophysis  have been found in aggregations  as have larger predators like  allosaurus  and  mapusaurus   there is some evidence of gregarious behaviour in other tyrannosaurids as well  fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found alongside  sue   the  tyrannosaurus  mounted in the field museum of natural history in chicago  and a bonebed in the two medicine formation of montana contains at least three specimens of  daspletosaurus   preserved alongside several hadrosaurs  these findings may corroborate the evidence for social behaviour in  albertosaurus   although some or all of the above localities may represent temporary or unnatural aggregations  others have speculated that instead of social groups  at least some of these finds represent komodo dragon like mobbing of carcasses  where aggressive competition leads to some of the predators being killed and cannibalized 

currie has also seculated on the pack hunting habits of  albertosaurus   the leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of ornithomimids  which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs  younger  albertosaurus  were probably equally fleet footed  or at least faster than their prey  currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults  who were larger and more powerful  but also slower  juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults  filling predator niches between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods  the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than adult  albertosaurus  in mass  a similar situation is observed in modern komodo dragons  with hatchlings beginning life as small insectivores before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands  however  as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare  these ideas cannot readily be tested  in       currie  though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis  admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes  such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood 

in       researchers hypothesized that smooth edged holes found in the fossil jaws of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as  albertosaurus  were caused by a parasite similar to  trichomonas gallinae   which infects birds  they suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other  and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food 

in       bruce rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior  they found that only one of the      albertosaurus  foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and none of the four hand bones did  the scientists found that stress fractures were  significantly  less common in  albertosaurus  than in the carnosaur  allosaurus   rom      the holotype of  a  arctunguis   now referred to  a  sarcophagus    had a deep hole in the iliac blade  although the describer of the species did not recognize this as pathological  the specimen also contains some exostosis on the fourth left metatarsal  in       two of the five  albertosaurus sarcophagus  specimens with humeri were reported by dale russel as having pathological damage to them 

in       the health of the dry island  albertosaurus  assembly was reported upon  most specimens showed no sign of disease  on three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs  consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons  so called enthesophytes  were present  their cause unknown  two ribs and a belly rib showed signs of breaking and healing  one adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks  the low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a  majungasaurus  population of which it in      was established that     of individuals showed bone pathologies 

according to a scientific paper published in        albertosaurus  could exert a bite force of around        newtons 

all identifiable fossils of  albertosaurus sarcophagus  are known from the upper horseshoe canyon formation in alberta  these younger units of this geologic formation date to the early maastrichtian stage of the late cretaceous period     to    ma  million years ago   immediately below this formation is the bearpaw shale  a marine formation representing a section of the western interior seaway  the seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the cretaceous  exposing land that had previously been underwater  it was not a smooth process  however  and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout horseshoe canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after  due to the changing sea levels  many different environments are represented in the horseshoe canyon formation  including offshore and near shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons  estuaries and tidal flats  numerous coal seams represent ancient peat swamps  like most of the other vertebrate fossils from the formation   albertosaurus  remains are found in deposits laid down in the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of horseshoe canyon times 

the fauna of the horseshoe canyon formation is well known  as vertebrate fossils  including those of dinosaurs  are quite common  sharks  rays  sturgeons  bowfins  gars and the gar like  aspidorhynchus  made up the fish fauna  mammals included multituberculates and the marsupial  didelphodon   the saltwater plesiosaur  leurospondylus  has been found in marine sediments in the horseshoe canyon  while freshwater environments were populated by turtles   champsosaurus   and crocodilians like  leidyosuchus  and  stangerochampsa   dinosaurs dominate the fauna  especially hadrosaurs  which make up half of all dinosaurs known  including the genera  edmontosaurus    saurolophus  and  hypacrosaurus   ceratopsians and ornithomimids were also very common  together making up another third of the known fauna  along with much rarer ankylosaurians and pachycephalosaurs  all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods  including troodontids  dromaeosaurids  and caenagnathids  intermingled with the  albertosaurus  remains of the dry island bonebed  the bones of the small theropod  albertonykus  were found  adult  albertosaurus  were the apex predators in this environment  with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs 





assembly language

an assembly  or assembler  language  often abbreviated asm  is any low level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program s statements and the architecture s machine code instructions 

each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system  in contrast  most high level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling  assembly language may also be called  symbolic machine code  

assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction  but assembler directives  macros and symbolic labels of program and memory locations are often also supported 

assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an  assembler   the conversion process is referred to as  assembly   or  assembling  the source code 

assembly language uses a mnemonic to represent each low level machine instruction or opcode  typically also each architectural register  flag  etc  many operations require one or more operands in order to form a complete instruction  most assemblers permit named constants  registers  and labels for program and memory locations  and can calculate expressions for operands  thus  the programmers are freed from tedious repetitive calculations and assembler programs are much more readable than machine code  depending on the architecture  these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or addressing modes using offsets or other data as well as fixed addresses  many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development  to control the assembly process  and to aid debugging 


an assembler program creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents  this representation typically includes an  operation code    opcode   as well as other control bits and data  the assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves symbolic names for memory locations and other entities  the use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers  saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications  most assemblers also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution     e g   to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline  instead of  called  subroutines 

some assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of instruction set specific optimizations  one concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x   assemblers from various vendors  most of them are able to perform jump instruction replacements  long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps  in any number of passes  on request  others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions  such as some assemblers for risc architectures that can help optimize a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the cpu pipeline as efficiently as possible 

like early programming languages such as fortran  algol  cobol and lisp  assemblers have been available since the     s and the first generations of text based computer interfaces  however  assemblers came first as they are far simpler to write than compilers for high level languages  this is because each mnemonic along with the addressing modes and operands of an instruction translates rather directly into the numeric representations of that particular instruction  without much context or analysis  there have also been several classes of translators and semi automatic code generators with properties similar to both assembly and high level languages  with speedcode as perhaps one of the better known examples 

there may be several assemblers with different syntax for a particular cpu or instruction set architecture  for instance  an instruction to add memory data to a register in a x   family processor might be codice    in original  intel syntax   whereas this would be written codice   in the  at t syntax  used by the gnu assembler  despite different appearances  different syntactic forms generally generate the same numeric machine code  see further below  a single assembler may also have different modes in order to support variations in syntactic forms as well as their exact semantic interpretations  such as fasm syntax  tasm syntax  ideal mode etc   in the special case of x   assembly programming  

there are two types of assemblers based on how many passes through the source are needed  how many times the assembler reads the source  to produce the object file 
in both cases  the assembler must be able to determine the size of each instruction on the initial passes in order to calculate the addresses of subsequent symbols  this means that if the size of an operation referring to an operand defined later depends on the type or distance of the operand  the assembler will make a pessimistic estimate when first encountering the operation  and if necessary pad it with one or more
 no operation  instructions in a later pass or the errata  in an assembler with peephole optimization  addresses may be recalculated between passes to allow replacing pessimistic code with code tailored to the exact distance from the target 

the original reason for the use of one pass assemblers was speed of assembly     often a second pass would require rewinding and rereading the program source on tape or rereading a deck of cards or punched paper tape  later computers with much larger memories  especially disc storage   had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re reading  the advantage of the multi pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the linking process  or the program load if the assembler directly produces executable code  faster 

example  in the following code snippet a one pass assembler would be able to determine the address of the backward reference bkwd when assembling statement s   but would not be able to determine the address of the forward reference fwd when assembling the branch statement s   indeed fwd may be undefined  a two pass assembler would determine both addresses in pass    so they would be known when generating code in pass   

more sophisticated high level assemblers provide language abstractions such as 
see language design below for more details 

a program written in assembly language consists of a series of mnemonic processor instructions and meta statements  known variously as directives  pseudo instructions and pseudo ops   comments and data  assembly language instructions usually consist of an opcode mnemonic followed by a list of data  arguments or parameters  these are translated by an assembler into machine language instructions that can be loaded into memory and executed 

for example  the instruction below tells an x   ia    processor to move an immediate   bit value into a register  the binary code for this instruction is       followed by a   bit identifier for which register to use  the identifier for the  al  register is      so the following machine code loads the  al  register with the data          
this binary computer code can be made more human readable by expressing it in hexadecimal as follows 
here  codice   means  move a copy of the following value into  al    and codice   is a hexadecimal representation of the value           which is    in decimal  assembly language for the      family provides the mnemonic mov  an abbreviation of  move   for instructions such as this  so the machine code above can be written as follows in assembly language  complete with an explanatory comment if required  after the semicolon  this is much easier to read and to remember 
mov al    h   load al with    decimal     hex 

in some assembly languages the same mnemonic such as mov may be used for a family of related instructions for loading  copying and moving data  whether these are immediate values  values in registers  or memory locations pointed to by values in registers  other assemblers may use separate opcode mnemonics such as l for  move memory to register   st for  move register to memory   lr for  move register to register   mvi for  move immediate operand to memory   etc 

the x   opcode           codice    copies an   bit value into the  al  register  while           codice    moves it into  cl  and           codice    does so into  dl   assembly language examples for these follow 

mov al   h   load al with immediate value  
mov cl   h   load cl with immediate value  
mov dl   h   load dl with immediate value  

the syntax of mov can also be more complex as the following examples show 

mov eax   ebx    move the   bytes in memory at the address contained in ebx into eax
mov  esi eax   cl   move the contents of cl into the byte at address esi eax

in each case  the mov mnemonic is translated directly into an opcode in the ranges     e  a  a   b  b   c  or c  by an assembler  and the programmer does not have to know or remember which 

transforming assembly language into machine code is the job of an assembler  and the reverse can at least partially be achieved by a disassembler  unlike high level languages  there is a one to one correspondence between many simple assembly statements and machine language instructions  however  in some cases  an assembler may provide  pseudoinstructions   essentially macros  which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality  for example  for a machine that lacks a  branch if greater or equal  instruction  an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machine s  set if less than  and  branch if zero  on the result of the set instruction    most full featured assemblers also provide a rich macro language  discussed below  which is used by vendors and programmers to generate more complex code and data sequences 

each computer architecture has its own machine language  computers differ in the number and type of operations they support  in the different sizes and numbers of registers  and in the representations of data in storage  while most general purpose computers are able to carry out essentially the same functionality  the ways they do so differ  the corresponding assembly languages reflect these differences 

multiple sets of mnemonics or assembly language syntax may exist for a single instruction set  typically instantiated in different assembler programs  in these cases  the most popular one is usually that supplied by the manufacturer and used in its documentation 

there is a large degree of diversity in the way the authors of assemblers categorize statements and in the nomenclature that they use  in particular  some describe anything other than a machine mnemonic or extended mnemonic as a pseudo operation  pseudo op   a typical assembly language consists of   types of instruction statements that are used to define program operations 

instructions  statements  in assembly language are generally very simple  unlike those in high level languages  generally  a mnemonic is a symbolic name for a single executable machine language instruction  an opcode   and there is at least one opcode mnemonic defined for each machine language instruction  each instruction typically consists of an  operation  or  opcode  plus zero or more  operands   most instructions refer to a single value  or a pair of values  operands can be immediate  value coded in the instruction itself   registers specified in the instruction or implied  or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage  this is determined by the underlying processor architecture  the assembler merely reflects how this architecture works   extended mnemonics  are often used to specify a combination of an opcode with a specific operand  e g   the system     assemblers use as an extended mnemonic for with a mask of    and   no operation      do nothing for one step  for with a mask of   

 extended mnemonics  are often used to support specialized uses of instructions  often for purposes not obvious from the instruction name  for example  many cpu s do not have an explicit nop instruction  but do have instructions that can be used for the purpose  in      cpus the instruction is used for   with being a pseudo opcode to encode the instruction   some disassemblers recognize this and will decode the instruction as   similarly  ibm assemblers for system     and system     use the extended mnemonics and for and with zero masks  for the sparc architecture  these are known as  synthetic instructions  

some assemblers also support simple built in macro instructions that generate two or more machine instructions  for instance  with some z   assemblers the instruction is recognized to generate followed by   these are sometimes known as  pseudo opcodes  

mnemonics are arbitrary symbols  in      the ieee published standard     for a uniform set of mnemonics to be used by all assemblers  the standard has since been withdrawn 

there are instructions used to define data elements to hold data and variables  they define the type of data  the length and the alignment of data  these instructions can also define whether the data is available to outside programs  programs assembled separately  or only to the program in which the data section is defined  some assemblers classify these as pseudo ops 

assembly directives  also called pseudo opcodes  pseudo operations or pseudo ops  are commands given to an assembler  directing it to perform operations other than assembling instructions    directives affect how the assembler operates and  may affect the object code  the symbol table  the listing file  and the values of internal assembler parameters   sometimes the term  pseudo opcode  is reserved for directives that generate object code  such as those that generate data 

the names of pseudo ops often start with a dot to distinguish them from machine instructions  pseudo ops can make the assembly of the program dependent on parameters input by a programmer  so that one program can be assembled different ways  perhaps for different applications  or  a pseudo op can be used to manipulate presentation of a program to make it easier to read and maintain  another common use of pseudo ops is to reserve storage areas for run time data and optionally initialize their contents to known values 

symbolic assemblers let programmers associate arbitrary names   labels  or  symbols   with memory locations and various constants  usually  every constant and variable is given a name so instructions can reference those locations by name  thus promoting self documenting code  in executable code  the name of each subroutine is associated with its entry point  so any calls to a subroutine can use its name  inside subroutines  goto destinations are given labels  some assemblers support  local symbols  which are lexically distinct from normal symbols  e g   the use of       as a goto destination  

some assemblers  such as nasm  provide flexible symbol management  letting programmers manage different namespaces  automatically calculate offsets within data structures  and assign labels that refer to literal values or the result of simple computations performed by the assembler  labels can also be used to initialize constants and variables with relocatable addresses 

assembly languages  like most other computer languages  allow comments to be added to program source code that will be ignored during assembly  judicious commenting is essential in assembly language programs  as the meaning and purpose of a sequence of binary machine instructions can be difficult to determine  the  raw   uncommented  assembly language generated by compilers or disassemblers is quite difficult to read when changes must be made 

many assemblers support  predefined macros   and others support  programmer defined   and repeatedly re definable  macros involving sequences of text lines in which variables and constants are embedded  the macro definition is most commonly a mixture of assembler statements  e g   directives  symbolic machine instructions  and templates for assembler statements  this sequence of text lines may include opcodes or directives  once a macro has been defined its name may be used in place of a mnemonic  when the assembler processes such a statement  it replaces the statement with the text lines associated with that macro  then processes them as if they existed in the source code file  including  in some assemblers  expansion of any macros existing in the replacement text   macros in this sense date to ibm autocoders of the     s 
in assembly language  the term  macro  represents a more comprehensive concept than it does in some other contexts  such as in the c programming language  where its  define directive typically is used to create short single line macros  assembler macro instructions  like macros in pl i and some other languages  can be lengthy  programs  by themselves  executed by interpretation by the assembler during assembly 

since macros can have  short  names but expand to several or indeed many lines of code  they can be used to make assembly language programs appear to be far shorter  requiring fewer lines of source code  as with higher level languages  they can also be used to add higher levels of structure to assembly programs  optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameters and other similar features 

macro assemblers often allow macros to take parameters  some assemblers include quite sophisticated macro languages  incorporating such high level language elements as optional parameters  symbolic variables  conditionals  string manipulation  and arithmetic operations  all usable during the execution of a given macro  and allowing macros to save context or exchange information  thus a macro might generate numerous assembly language instructions or data definitions  based on the macro arguments  this could be used to generate record style data structures or  unrolled  loops  for example  or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters  for instance  a  sort  macro could accept the specification of a complex sort key and generate code crafted for that specific key  not needing the run time tests that would be required for a general procedure interpreting the specification  an organization using assembly language that has been heavily extended using such a macro suite can be considered to be working in a higher level language  since such programmers are not working with a computer s lowest level conceptual elements  underlining this point  macros were used to implement an early virtual machine in snobol          which was written in the snobol implementation language  sil   an assembly language for a virtual machine  the target machine would translate this to its native code using a macro assembler  this allowed a high degree of portability for the time 

macros were used to customize large scale software systems for specific customers in the mainframe era and were also used by customer personnel to satisfy their employers  needs by making specific versions of manufacturer operating systems  this was done  for example  by systems programmers working with ibm s conversational monitor system   virtual machine  vm cms  and with ibm s  real time transaction processing  add ons  customer information control system cics  and acp tpf  the airline financial system that began in the     s and still runs many large computer reservation systems  crs  and credit card systems today 

it is also possible to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages  for example  to generate a version of a program in cobol using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of cobol code inside assembly time operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code  ibm os     uses macros to perform system generation  the user specifies options by coding a series of assembler macros  assembling these macros generates a job stream to build the system  including job control language and utility control statements 

this is because  as was realized in the     s  the concept of  macro processing  is independent of the concept of  assembly   the former being in modern terms more word processing  text processing  than generating object code  the concept of macro processing appeared  and appears  in the c programming language  which supports  preprocessor instructions  to set variables  and make conditional tests on their values  note that unlike certain previous macro processors inside assemblers  the c preprocessor is not turing complete because it lacks the ability to either loop or  go to   the latter allowing programs to loop 

despite the power of macro processing  it fell into disuse in many high level languages  major exceptions being c  c   and pl i  while remaining a perennial for assemblers 

macro parameter substitution is strictly by name  at macro processing time  the value of a parameter is textually substituted for its name  the most famous class of bugs resulting was the use of a parameter that itself was an expression and not a simple name when the macro writer expected a name  in the macro 

the intention was that the caller would provide the name of a variable  and the  global  variable or constant b would be used to multiply  a   if foo is called with the parameter codice    the macro expansion of codice   occurs  to avoid any possible ambiguity  users of macro processors can parenthesize formal parameters inside macro definitions  or callers can parenthesize the input parameters 

some assemblers have incorporated structured programming elements to encode execution flow  the earliest example of this approach was in the concept    macro set  originally proposed by dr  harlan mills  march        and implemented by marvin kessler at ibm s federal systems division  which extended the s     macro assembler with if else endif and similar control flow blocks  this was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of goto operations in assembly code  one of the main factors causing spaghetti code in assembly language  this approach was widely accepted in the early    s  the latter days of large scale assembly language use  

a curious design was a natural  a  stream oriented  assembler for      z   processors from whitesmiths ltd   developers of the unix like idris operating system  and what was reported to be the first commercial c compiler   the language was classified as an assembler  because it worked with raw machine elements such as opcodes  registers  and memory references  but it incorporated an expression syntax to indicate execution order  parentheses and other special symbols  along with block oriented structured programming constructs  controlled the sequence of the generated instructions  a natural was built as the object language of a c compiler  rather than for hand coding  but its logical syntax won some fans 

there has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemblers since the decline of large scale assembly language development  in spite of that  they are still being developed and applied in cases where resource constraints or peculiarities in the target system s architecture prevent the effective use of higher level languages 

assemblers with a strong macro engine allow structured programming via macros  such as the switch macro provided with the masm   package  note this code is a complete program  

assembly languages date to the introduction of the stored program computer  the first assembly language was developed in      by kathleen booth for the arc  at birkbeck  university of london following work with john von neumann and herman goldstine at the institute for advanced study  the electronic delay storage automatic calculator  edsac  had an assembler  named  initial orders   integrated into its bootstrap program that used one letter mnemonics in late      developed by david wheeler and credited by the ieee computer society as the creator of the first  assembler   reports on the edsac introduced the term  assembly  for the process of combining fields into an instruction word  soap  symbolic optimal assembly program  was an assembly language for the ibm     computer written by stan poley in      

assembly languages eliminate much of the error prone  tedious  and time consuming first generation programming needed with the earliest computers  freeing programmers from tedium such as remembering numeric codes and calculating addresses  they were once widely used for all sorts of programming  however  by the     s      s on microcomputers   their use had largely been supplanted by higher level languages  in the search for improved programming productivity  today assembly language is still used for direct hardware manipulation  access to specialized processor instructions  or to address critical performance issues  typical uses are device drivers  low level embedded systems  and real time systems 

historically  numerous programs have been written entirely in assembly language  the burroughs mcp        was the first computer for which an operating system was not developed entirely in assembly language  it was written in executive systems problem oriented language  espol   an algol dialect  many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well  including a large amount of the ibm mainframe software written by large corporations  cobol  fortran and some pl i eventually displaced much of this work  although a number of large organizations retained assembly language application infrastructures well into the     s 

most early microcomputers relied on hand coded assembly language  including most operating systems and large applications  this was because these systems had severe resource constraints  imposed idiosyncratic memory and display architectures  and provided limited  buggy system services  perhaps more important was the lack of first class high level language compilers suitable for microcomputer use  a psychological factor may have also played a role  the first generation of microcomputer programmers retained a hobbyist   wires and pliers  attitude 

in a more commercial context  the biggest reasons for using assembly language were minimal bloat  size   minimal overhead  greater speed  and reliability 

typical examples of large assembly language programs from this time are ibm pc dos operating systems  the turbo pascal compiler and early applications such as the spreadsheet program lotus        according to some industry insiders  the assembly language was the best computer language to use to get the best performance out of the sega saturn  a console that was notoriously challenging to develop and program games for  the      arcade game  nba jam  is another example 

assembly language has long been the primary development language for many popular home computers of the     s and     s  such as the msx  sinclair zx spectrum  commodore     commodore amiga  and atari st   this was in large part because interpreted basic dialects on these systems offered insufficient execution speed  as well as insufficient facilities to take full advantage of the available hardware on these systems  some systems even have an integrated development environment  ide  with highly advanced debugging and macro facilities  some compilers available for the radio shack trs    and its successors had the capability to combine inline assembly source with high level program statements  upon compilation a built in assembler produced inline machine code 

there have always been debates over the usefulness and performance of assembly language relative to high level languages  assembly language has specific niche uses where it is important  see below    the tiobe index of programming language popularity ranks assembly language at     ahead of visual basic  for example  assembler can be used to optimize for speed or optimize for size  in the case of speed optimization  modern optimizing compilers are claimed to render high level languages into code that can run as fast as hand written assembly  despite the counter examples that can be found  the complexity of modern processors and memory sub systems makes effective optimization increasingly difficult for compilers  as well as assembly programmers  moreover  increasing processor performance has meant that most cpus sit idle most of the time  with delays caused by predictable bottlenecks such as cache misses  i o operations and paging  this has made raw code execution speed a non issue for many programmers 

there are some situations in which developers might choose to use assembly language 

assembly language is still taught in most computer science and electronic engineering programs  although few programmers today regularly work with assembly language as a tool  the underlying concepts remain very important  such fundamental topics as binary arithmetic  memory allocation  stack processing  character set encoding  interrupt processing  and compiler design would be hard to study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level  since a computer s behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set  the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language  most modern computers have similar instruction sets  therefore  studying a single assembly language is sufficient to learn  i  the basic concepts  ii  to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate  and iii  to see how efficient executable code can be created from high level languages  this is analogous to children needing to learn the basic arithmetic operations  e g   long division   although calculators are widely used for all except the most trivial calculations 








ambrosia

in the ancient greek myths  ambrosia      is sometimes the food or drink of the greek gods  often depicted as conferring longevity or immortality upon whoever consumed it  it was brought to the gods in olympus by doves 

 ambrosia  is sometimes depicted in ancient art as distributed by a nymph labeled with that name  in the myth of lycurgus  an opponent to the wine god dionysus  violence committed against ambrosia turns her into a grapevine 

ambrosia is very closely related to the gods  other form of sustenance   nectar   the two terms may not have originally been distinguished  though in homer s poems nectar is usually the drink and ambrosia the food of the gods  it was with ambrosia hera  cleansed all defilement from her lovely flesh   and with ambrosia athena prepared penelope in her sleep  so that when she appeared for the final time before her suitors  the effects of years had been stripped away  and they were inflamed with passion at the sight of her  on the other hand  in alcman  nectar is the food  and in sappho and anaxandrides  ambrosia is the drink  a character in aristophanes   knights  says   i dreamed the goddess poured ambrosia over your head   out of a ladle   both descriptions could be correct  as ambrosia could be a liquid considered a food  such as honey  

the consumption of ambrosia was typically reserved for divine beings  upon his assumption into immortality on olympus  heracles is given ambrosia by athena  while the hero tydeus is denied the same thing when the goddess discovers him eating human brains  in one version of the myth of tantalus  part of tantalus  crime is that after tasting ambrosia himself  he attempts to steal some away to give to other mortals  those who consume ambrosia typically had not blood in their veins  but ichor the blood of immortals 

both nectar and ambrosia are fragrant  and may be used as perfume  in the  odyssey  menelaus and his men are disguised as seals in untanned seal skins   and the deadly smell of the seal skins vexed us sore  but the goddess saved us  she brought ambrosia and put it under our nostrils   homer speaks of ambrosial raiment  ambrosial locks of hair  even the gods  ambrosial sandals 

among later writers   ambrosia  has been so often used with generic meanings of  delightful liquid  that such late writers as athenaeus  paulus and dioscurides employ it as a technical terms in contexts of cookery  medicine  and botany  pliny used the term in connection with different plants  as did early herbalists 

additionally  some modern ethnomycologists  such as danny staples  identify ambrosia with the hallucinogenic mushroom  amanita muscaria    it was the food of the gods  their ambrosia  and nectar was the pressed sap of its juices   staples asserts 

w  h  roscher thinks that both nectar and ambrosia were kinds of honey  in which case their power of conferring immortality would be due to the supposed healing and cleansing powers of honey  which is in fact anti septic  and because fermented honey  mead  preceded wine as an entheogen in the aegean world  on some minoan seals  goddesses were represented with bee faces  compare merope and melissa  

the concept of an immortality drink is attested in at least two indo european areas  greek and sanskrit  the greek                     ambrosia   is semantically linked to the sanskrit   am   ta   as both words denote a drink or food that gods use to achieve immortality  the two words appear to be derived from the same indo european form       m    t  s    un dying    n    negative prefix from which the prefix  a   in both greek and sanskrit are derived   m      zero grade of   mer     to die   and   to    adjectival suffix   a semantically similar etymology exists for nectar  the beverage of the gods  greek                n  ktar   presumed to be a compound of the pie roots   nek     death   and    tar    overcoming  


lycurgus of thrace  an antagonist of dionysus  forbade the cult of dionysus  whom he drove from thrace  and was driven mad by the god  in his fit of insanity he killed his son  whom he mistook for a stock of mature ivy  and the nymph ambrosia  who was transformed into the grapevine 






ambrose

aurelius ambrosius             better known in english as ambrose     was a bishop of milan who became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the  th century  he was the roman governor of liguria and emilia  headquartered in milan  before being made bishop of milan by popular acclamation in      ambrose was a staunch opponent of arianism 

ambrose was one of the four original doctors of the church  and is the patron saint of milan  he is notable for his influence on augustine of hippo 

traditionally  ambrose is credited with promoting  antiphonal chant   a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other  as well as with composing  veni redemptor gentium   an advent hymn 

ambrose was born into a roman christian family about     and was raised in gallia belgica  the capital of which was augusta treverorum  his father is sometimes identified with aurelius ambrosius  a praetorian prefect of gaul  but some scholars identify his father as an official named uranius who received an imperial constitution dated   february      addressed in a brief extract from one of the three emperors ruling in      constantine ii  constantius ii  or constans  in the  codex theodosianus   book xi    

his mother was a woman of intellect and piety and a member of the roman family   aurelii symmachi  and thus ambrose was cousin of the orator q  aurelius symmachus  he was the youngest of three children  who included marcellina and satyrus  who is the subject of ambrose s  de excessu fratris satyri    also venerated as saints  there is a legend that as an infant  a swarm of bees settled on his face while he lay in his cradle  leaving behind a drop of honey  his father considered this a sign of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue  for this reason  bees and beehives often appear in the saint s symbology 

after the early death of his father  ambrose went to rome  where he studied literature  law  and rhetoric  he then followed in his father s footsteps and entered public service  praetorian prefect sextus claudius petronius probus first gave him a place in the council and then in about     made him governor of liguria and emilia  with headquarters at milan  in     diocletian had moved the capital of the western roman empire from rome to mediolanum  milan  

ambrose was the governor of aemilia liguria in northern italy until      when he became the bishop of milan  he was a very popular political figure  and since he was the governor in the effective capital in the roman west  he was a recognizable figure in the court of valentinian i 

in the late  th century there was a deep conflict in the diocese of milan between the nicene church and arians  in     the bishop of milan  auxentius  an arian  died  and the arians challenged the succession  ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place  to prevent an uproar  which was probable in this crisis  his address was interrupted by a call   ambrose  bishop    which was taken up by the whole assembly 

ambrose was known to be nicene christian in belief  but also acceptable to arians due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard  at first he energetically refused the office  for which he was in no way prepared  ambrose was neither baptized nor formally trained in theology  upon his appointment  ambrose fled to a colleague s home seeking to hide  upon receiving a letter from the emperor gratian praising the appropriateness of rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions  ambrose s host gave him up  within a week  he was baptized  ordained and duly consecrated bishop of milan 

as bishop  he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle  apportioned his money to the poor  donating all of his land  making only provision for his sister marcellina  who had become a nun   this raised his popularity even further  giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor  upon the unexpected appointment of ambrose to the episcopate  his brother satyrus resigned a prefecture in order to move to milan  where he took over managing the family s affairs 

ambrose studied theology with simplician  a presbyter of rome  using his excellent knowledge of greek  which was then rare in the west  to his advantage  he studied the old testament and greek authors like philo  origen  athanasius  and basil of caesarea  with whom he was also exchanging letters  he applied this knowledge as preacher  concentrating especially on exegesis of the old testament  and his rhetorical abilities impressed augustine of hippo  who hitherto had thought poorly of christian preachers 

in the confrontation with arians  ambrose sought to theologically refute their propositions  which were contrary to the nicene creed and thus to the officially defined orthodoxy  the arians appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the western and eastern empires  although the western emperor gratian supported orthodoxy  the younger valentinian ii  who became his colleague in the empire  adhered to the arian creed  ambrose did not sway the young prince s position  in the east  emperor theodosius i likewise professed the nicene creed  but there were many adherents of arianism throughout his dominions  especially among the higher clergy 

in this contested state of religious opinion  two leaders of the arians  bishops palladius of ratiaria and secundianus of singidunum  confident of numbers  prevailed upon gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire  this request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation  however  ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the western bishops  accordingly  a synod composed of thirty two bishops was held at aquileia in the year      ambrose was elected president and palladius  being called upon to defend his opinions  declined  a vote was then taken  when palladius and his associate secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices 

nevertheless  the increasing strength of the arians proved a formidable task for ambrose  in     or     the emperor and his mother justina  along with a considerable number of clergy and laity  especially military  professed arianism  they demanded two churches in milan  one in the city  the basilica of the apostles   the other in the suburbs  st victor s   be allocated to the arians  ambrose refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council  he went  his eloquence in defense of the church reportedly overawing the ministers of valentinian  so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches  the day following  when he was performing divine service in the basilica  the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the portian basilica in the suburbs  as he still refused  certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the portian basilica  by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of easter 

in spite of imperial opposition  ambrose declared   if you demand my person  i am ready to submit  carry me to prison or to death  i will not resist  but i will never betray the church of christ  i will not call upon the people to succour me  i will die at the foot of the altar rather than desert it  the tumult of the people i will not encourage  but god alone can appease it  

in     justina and valentinian received the arian bishop auxentius the younger  and ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in milan for arian usage  ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church  and the imperial order was rescinded 

the imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of ambrose  however his aid was soon solicited by the emperor  when magnus maximus usurped the supreme power in gaul  and was meditating a descent upon italy  valentinian sent ambrose to dissuade him from the undertaking  and the embassy was successful 

a second later embassy was unsuccessful  the enemy entered italy and milan was taken  justina and her son fled but ambrose remained at his post and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief 

theodosius i  the emperor of the east  espoused the cause of justina  and regained the kingdom  theodosius was excommunicated by ambrose for the massacre of       people at thessalonica in      after the murder of the roman governor there by rioters  ambrose told theodosius to imitate david in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt      ambrose readmitted the emperor to the eucharist only after several months of penance  this shows the strong position of a bishop in the western part of the empire  even when facing a strong emperor      the controversy of john chrysostom with a much weaker emperor a few years later in constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop 

in      after the death of valentinian ii and the fall of eugenius  ambrose supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported eugenius after theodosius was eventually victorious 

in his treatise on abraham  ambrose warns against intermarriage with pagans  jews  or heretics  in      emperor theodosius the great was informed that a crowd of christians  led by their bishop  had destroyed the synagogue at callinicum on the euphrates  in retaliation for the burning of their church by the jews  he ordered the synagogue rebuilt at the expense of the bishop  but ambrose persuaded theodosius to retreat from this position  he wrote to the emperor  pointing out that he was thereby  exposing the bishop to the danger of either acting against the truth or of death   in the letter  the reasons given for the imperial rescript are met  especially by the plea that the jews had burnt many churches   in the course of the letter ambrose speaks of the clemency that the emperor had shown with regard to the many houses of wealthy people and churches that had been destroyed by unruly mobs  with many then still not restored and then adds   there is  then  no adequate cause for such a commotion  that the people should be so severely punished for the burning of a building  and much less since it is the burning of a synagogue  a home of unbelief  a house of impiety  a receptacle of folly  which god himself has condemned  for thus we read  where the lord our god speaks by the mouth of the prophet jeremiah   and i will do to this house  which is called by my name  wherein ye trust  and to the place which i gave to you and to your fathers  as i have done to shiloh  and i will cast you forth from my sight  as i cast forth your brethren  the whole seed of ephraim  and do not thou pray for that people  and do not thou ask mercy for them  and do not come near me on their behalf  for i will not hear thee  or seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah   god forbids intercession to be made for those   yet  ambrose did not oppose punishing those who were directly responsible for destroying the synagogue 

in his exposition of psalm    ambrose says   virtues without faith are leaves  flourishing in appearance  but unproductive  how many pagans have mercy and sobriety but no fruit  because they do not attain their purpose  the leaves speedily fall at the wind s breath  some jews exhibit purity of life and much diligence and love of study  but bear no fruit and live like leaves  

under his influence  emperors gratian  valentinian ii and theodosius i carried on a persecution of paganism  theodosius issued the      theodosian decrees   which with increasing intensity outlawed pagan practices  the altar of victory was removed by gratian  ambrose prevailed upon gratian  valentinian and theodosius to reject requests to restore the altar 

in april     arbogast   magister militum  of the west and his puppet emperor eugenius marched into italy to consolidate their position in regard to theodosius i and his son  honorius  whom theodosius had appointed augustus to govern the western portion of the empire  arbogast and eugenius courted ambrose s support by very obliging letters  but before they arrived at milan  he had retired to bologna  where he assisted at the translation of the relics of saints vitalis and agricola  from there he went to florence  where he remained until eugenius withdrew from milan to meet theodosius in the battle of the frigidus in early september     
soon after acquiring the undisputed possession of the roman empire  theodosius died at milan in      and two years later    april      ambrose also died  he was succeeded as bishop of milan by simplician  ambrose s body may still be viewed in the church of saint ambrogio in milan  where it has been continuously venerated      along with the bodies identified in his time as being those of saints gervase and protase 

many circumstances in the history of ambrose are characteristic of the general spirit of the times  the chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period  but it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people 

it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times  and he introduced popular reforms in the order and manner of public worship  it is alleged  too  that at a time when the influence of ambrose required vigorous support  he was admonished in a dream to search for  and found under the pavement of the church  the remains of two martyrs  gervasius and protasius  the saints  although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old  looked as if they had just died  the applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party 

ambrose ranks with augustine  jerome  and gregory the great  as one of the latin doctors of the church  theologians compare him with hilary  who they claim fell short of ambrose s administrative excellence but demonstrated greater theological ability  he succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of biblical and doctrinal subjects 

ambrose s intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing doctrine of the church and its sacerdotal ministry  while the prevalent asceticism of the day  continuing the stoic and ciceronian training of his youth  enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of christian ethics  thus we have the  de officiis ministrorum    de viduis    de virginitate  and  de paenitentia  

ambrose displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping god  and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place  his advice to augustine of hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom   when i am at rome  i fast on a saturday  when i am at milan  i do not  follow the custom of the church where you are   thus ambrose refused to be drawn into a false conflict over which particular local church had the  right  liturgical form where there was no substantial problem  his advice has remained in the english language as the saying   when in rome  do as the romans do  

one interpretation of ambrose s writings is that he was a christian universalist  it has been noted that ambrose s theology was significantly influenced by that of origen and didymus the blind  two other early christian universalists  one quotation cited in favor of this belief 
one could interpret this passage as being another example of the mainstream christian belief in a general resurrection  both for those in heaven and for those in hell   several other works by ambrose clearly teach the mainstream view of salvation  for example   the jews feared to believe in manhood taken up into god   and therefore have lost the grace of redemption   because they reject that on which salvation depends  

he was also interested in the condition of contemporary italian society  ambrose considered the poor not a distinct group of outsiders  but a part of the united  solidary people  giving to the poor was not to be considered an act of generosity towards the fringes of society but a repayment of resources that god had originally bestowed on everyone equally and that the rich had usurped 

the theological treatises of ambrose of milan would come to influence popes damasus  siricius and leo xiii  central to ambrose is the virginity of mary and her role as mother of god 


ambrose viewed celibacy as superior to marriage and saw mary as the model of virginity 

in matters of exegesis he is  like hilary  an alexandrian  in dogma he follows basil of caesarea and other greek authors  but nevertheless gives a distinctly western cast to the speculations of which he treats  this is particularly manifest in the weightier emphasis which he lays upon human sin and divine grace  and in the place which he assigns to faith in the individual christian life 

ambrose is traditionally credited but not actually known to have composed any of the repertory of ambrosian chant also known simply as  antiphonal chant   a method of chanting where one side of the choir alternately responds to the other   the later pope saint gregory i the great is not known to have composed any gregorian chant  the plainsong or  romish chant    however  ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the church  he is credited with introducing hymnody from the eastern church into the west 

catching the impulse from hilary of arles and confirmed in it by the success of arian psalmody  ambrose composed several original hymns as well  four of which still survive  along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies  each of these hymns has eight four line stanzas and is written in strict iambic tetrameter  that is   x   syllables  each iamb being two syllables   marked by dignified simplicity  they served as a fruitful model for later times 

in his writings  ambrose refers only to the performance of psalms  in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an  antiphon  

saint ambrose was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn  te deum   which he is said to have composed when he baptised saint augustine of hippo  his celebrated convert 

ambrose was bishop of milan at the time of augustine s conversion  and is mentioned in augustine s  confessions   it is commonly understood in the christian tradition that ambrose baptized augustine 

in a passage of augustine s  confessions  in which augustine wonders why he could not share his burden with ambrose  he comments   ambrose himself i esteemed a happy man  as the world counted happiness  because great personages held him in honor  only his celibacy appeared to me a painful burden  

in this same passage of augustine s  confessions  is an anecdote which bears on the history of reading 
this is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion  the practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become  in a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds  in which the production of books was very labor intensive  the majority of the population was illiterate  and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them  written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection  however  there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual

english translations

several of ambrose s works have recently been published in the bilingual latin german  fontes christiani  series  currently edited by brepols  

several religious brotherhoods which have sprung up in and around milan at various times since the   th century have been called ambrosians  their connection to ambrose is tenuous






ambracia

ambracia      occasionally    ampracia    was a city of ancient greece on the site of modern arta  it was captured by the corinthians in     bc and was situated about from the ambracian gulf  on a bend of the navigable river arachthos  or aratthus   in the midst of a fertile wooded plain 
it was founded between     and     bc by gorgus  son of the corinthian tyrant cypselus  at which time its economy was based on farmlands  fishing  timber for shipbuilding  and the exportation of the produce of epirus  after the expulsion of gorgus s son periander its government developed into a strong democracy  the early policy of ambracia was determined by its loyalty to corinth  for which it probably served as an entrepot in the epirus trade   and its consequent aversion to corcyra  as ambracia participated on the corinthian side at the battle of sybota  which took place in     bc between the rebellious corinthian colony of corcyra  modern corfu  and corinth  

ambraciot politics featured many frontier disputes with the amphilochians and acarnanians  hence it took a prominent part in the peloponnesian war until the crushing defeat at idomene        which crippled its resources 

in the  th century bc it continued its traditional policy  but in     was besieged by philip ii of macedon  with the assistance of corinth and athens  it escaped complete domination at philip s hands  but was nevertheless forced to accept a macedonian garrison  in     bc  after forty three years of semi autonomy under macedonian suzerainty  ambracia was given by the son of cassander to pyrrhus  king of epirus  who made it his capital  and adorned it with palace  temples and theatres  in the wars of philip v of macedon and the epirotes against the aetolian league             ambracia passed from one alliance to the other  but ultimately joined the latter confederacy  during the struggle of the aetolians against rome  it stood a stubborn siege  including the first known use of poison gas against the romans  siege tunnels 

ambracia was captured and plundered by marcus fulvius nobilior in     bc  after which it was declared by rome a  free city   and gradually fell into insignificance  the foundation by augustus of nicopolis  into which the remaining inhabitants were drafted  left the site desolate  in byzantine times a new settlement took its place under the name of arta  some fragmentary walls of large  well dressed blocks near this latter town indicate the early prosperity of ambracia

amber

amber is fossilized tree resin  which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since neolithic times  much valued from antiquity to the present as a gemstone  amber is made into a variety of decorative objects  amber is used in jewelry  it has also been used as a healing agent in folk medicine 

there are five classes of amber  defined on the basis of their chemical constituents  because it originates as a soft  sticky tree resin  amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions  amber occurring in coal seams is also called resinite  and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within new zealand coal seams 

the english word  amber  derives from arabic  cognate with middle persian  ambar   via middle latin  ambar  and middle french  ambre   the word was adopted in middle english in the   th century as referring to what is now known as  ambergris    ambre gris  or  grey amber    a solid waxy substance derived from the sperm whale  
in the romance languages  the sense of the word had come to be extended to baltic amber  fossil resin  from as early as the late   th century  at first called white or yellow amber   ambre jaune    this meaning was adopted in english by the early   th century  as the use of ambergris waned  this became the main sense of the word 

the two substances   yellow amber  and  grey amber   conceivably became associated or confused because they both were found washed up on beaches  ambergris is less dense than water and floats  whereas amber is too dense to float  though less dense than stone  
the classical names for amber  latin  electrum  and ancient greek     lektron    are connected to a term                     lekt  r   meaning  beaming sun   according to myth  when pha  ton son of helios  the sun  was killed  his mourning sisters became poplar trees  and their tears became  elektron   amber  the word  elektron  gave rise to the words  electric  electricity   and their relatives because of amber s ability to bear a static electricity charge 

theophrastus discussed amber in the  th century bc  as did pytheas  c      bc   whose work  on the ocean  is lost  but was referenced by pliny the elder     to    ad   according to whose  the natural history   in what is also the earliest known mention of the name  germania   

earlier pliny says that pytheas refers to a large island   three days  sail from the scythian coast and called balcia by xenophon of lampsacus  author of a fanciful travel book in greek    as  basilia    a name generally equated with  abalus   given the presence of amber  the island could have been heligoland  zealand  the shores of bay of gdansk  the sambia peninsula or the curonian lagoon  which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern europe 
it is assumed that there were well established trade routes for amber connecting the baltic with the mediterranean  known as the  amber road    pliny states explicitly that the germans exported amber to pannonia  from where the veneti distributed it onwards 

the ancient italic peoples of southern italy used to work amber  the national archaeological museum of siritide  museo archeologico nazionale della siritide  at policoro in the province of matera  basilicata  displays important surviving examples 
amber used in antiquity as at mycenae and in the prehistory of the mediterranean comes from deposits of sicily 

pliny also cites the opinion of nicias             bc   according to whom amber besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is  produced by the sun   pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin  citing the native latin name of  succinum    s  cinum   from  sucus   juice    he writes 

he also states that amber is also found in egypt and in india  and he even refers to the electrostatic properties of amber  by saying that  in syria the women make the whorls of their spindles of this substance  and give it the name of  harpax   from                 to drag   from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it  chaff  and the light fringe of tissues  

pliny says that the german name of amber was  gl  sum    for which reason the romans  when germanicus caesar commanded the fleet in those parts  gave to one of these islands the name of gl  saria  which by the barbarians was known as austeravia   this is confirmed by the recorded old high german word  glas  and by the old english word  gl  r  for  amber   compare  glass   
in middle low german  amber was known as  berne   barn   b  rnst  n   with etymological roots related to  burn  and to  stone    the low german term became dominant also in high german by the   th century  thus modern german  bernstein  besides dutch  barnsteen  

in the baltic languages  the lithuanian term for amber is  gintaras  and the latvian  dzintars   these words  and the slavic  jantar  and hungarian  gyanta    resin    are thought to originate from phoenician  jainitar    sea resin   

early in the nineteenth century  the first reports of amber found in north america came from discoveries in new jersey along crosswicks creek near trenton  at camden  and near woodbury 

amber is heterogeneous in composition  but consists of several resinous bodies more or less soluble in alcohol  ether and chloroform  associated with an insoluble bituminous substance  amber is a macromolecule by free radical polymerization of several precursors in the labdane family  e g  communic acid  cummunol  and biformene  these labdanes are diterpenes  ch  and trienes  equipping the organic skeleton with three alkene groups for polymerization  as amber matures over the years  more polymerization takes place as well as isomerization reactions  crosslinking and cyclization 

heated above   amber decomposes  yielding an oil of amber  and leaves a black residue which is known as  amber colophony   or  amber pitch   when dissolved in oil of turpentine or in linseed oil this forms  amber varnish  or  amber lac  

molecular polymerization  resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment  transforms the resin first into copal  sustained heat and pressure drives off terpenes and results in the formation of amber 

for this to happen  the resin must be resistant to decay  many trees produce resin  but in the majority of cases this deposit is broken down by physical and biological processes  exposure to sunlight  rain  microorganisms  such as bacteria and fungi   and extreme temperatures tends to disintegrate the resin  for the resin to survive long enough to become amber  it must be resistant to such forces or be produced under conditions that exclude them 

fossil resins from europe fall into two categories  the famous baltic ambers and another that resembles the  agathis  group  fossil resins from the americas and africa are closely related to the modern genus  hymenaea   while baltic ambers are thought to be fossil resins from sciadopityaceae family plants that used to live in north europe 

the abnormal development of resin in living trees   succinosis   can result in the formation of amber  impurities are quite often present  especially when the resin dropped onto the ground  so the material may be useless except for varnish making  such impure amber is called  firniss  

such inclusion of other substances can cause amber to have an unexpected color  pyrites may give a bluish color   bony amber  owes its cloudy opacity to numerous tiny bubbles inside the resin  however  so called  black amber  is really only a kind of jet 

in darkly clouded and even opaque amber  inclusions can be imaged using high energy  high contrast  high resolution x rays 

amber is globally distributed  mainly in rocks of cretaceous age or younger 
historically  the samland coast west of k  nigsberg in prussia was the world s leading source of amber  the first mentions of amber deposits here date back to the   th century  about     of the world s extractable amber is still located in that area  which became the kaliningrad oblast of russia in      

pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves  and collected by hand  dredging  or diving  elsewhere  amber is mined  both in open works and underground galleries  then nodules of  blue earth  have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off  which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water  erosion removes this crust from sea worn amber 
caribbean amber  especially dominican blue amber  is mined through bell pitting  which is dangerous due to the risk of tunnel collapse 

the vienna amber factories  which use pale amber to manufacture pipes and other smoking tools  turn it on a lathe and polish it with whitening and water or with rotten stone and oil  the final luster is given by friction with flannel 

when gradually heated in an oil bath  amber becomes soft and flexible  two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with linseed oil  heating them  and then pressing them together while hot  cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil bath  as the oil fills the numerous pores to which the turbidity is due 

small fragments  formerly thrown away or used only for varnish  are now used on a large scale in the formation of  ambroid  or  pressed amber   the pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure  the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate  the product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking  this pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light 

amber has often been imitated by other resins like copal and kauri gum  as well as by celluloid and even glass  baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially  but also called  true amber  

amber occurs in a range of different colors  as well as the usual yellow orange brown that is associated with the color  amber   amber itself can range from a whitish color through a pale lemon yellow  to brown and almost black  other uncommon colors include red amber  sometimes known as  cherry amber    green amber  and even blue amber  which is rare and highly sought after 

yellow amber is a hard fossil resin from evergreen trees  and despite the name it can be translucent  yellow  orange  or brown colored  known to the iranians by the pahlavi compound word kah ruba  from kah  straw  plus rubay  attract  snatch   referring to its electrical properties   which entered arabic as kahraba  or kahraba  which later became the arabic word for electricity                kahrab       it too was called amber in europe  old french and middle english ambre   found along the southern shore of the baltic sea  yellow amber reached the middle east and western europe via trade  its coastal acquisition may have been one reason yellow amber came to be designated by the same term as ambergris  moreover  like ambergris  the resin could be burned as an incense  the resin s most popular use was  however  for ornamentation   easily cut and polished  it could be transformed into beautiful jewelry 
much of the most highly prized amber is transparent  in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber  opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles  this kind of amber is known as  bony amber  

although all dominican amber is fluorescent  the rarest dominican amber is blue amber  it turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly ultraviolet light source  in long wave uv light it has a very strong reflection  almost white  only about is found per year  which makes it valuable and expensive 

sometimes amber retains the form of drops and stalactites  just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees  it is thought that  in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree  amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees  thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form 

amber can be classified into several forms  most fundamentally  there are two types of plant resin with the potential for fossilization  terpenoids  produced by conifers and angiosperms  consist of ring structures formed of isoprene  ch  units  phenolic resins are today only produced by angiosperms  and tend to serve functional uses  the extinct medullosans produced a third type of resin  which is often found as amber within their veins  the composition of resins is highly variable  each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of pyrolysis   gas chromatography   mass spectrometry  the overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes  there is also a separate classification of amber gemstones  according to the way of production 

this class is by far the most abundant  it comprises labdatriene carboxylic acids such as communic or ozic acids  it is further split into three sub classes  classes ia and ib utilize regular labdanoid diterpenes  e g  communic acid  communol  biformenes   while ic uses  enantio  labdanoids  ozic acid  ozol   enantio  biformenes  

class ia includes  succinite      normal  baltic amber  and  glessite   they have a communic acid base  and they also include much succinic acid 

baltic amber yields on dry distillation succinic acid  the proportion varying from about    to     and being greatest in the pale opaque or  bony  varieties  the aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid  baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid  hence the name  succinite   succinite has a hardness between   and    which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins  its specific gravity varies from      to       it can be distinguished from other ambers via ir spectroscopy due to a specific carbonyl absorption peak  ir spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample  succinic acid may not be an original component of amber  but rather a degradation product of abietic acid 

like class ia ambers  these are based on communic acid  however  they lack succinic acid 

this class is mainly based on  enantio  labdatrienonic acids  such as ozic and zanzibaric acids  its most familiar representative is dominican amber 

dominican amber differentiates itself from baltic amber by being mostly transparent and often containing a higher number of fossil inclusions  this has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long vanished tropical forest  resin from the extinct species  hymenaea protera  is the source of dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics  it is not  succinite  but  retinite  

these ambers are formed from resins with a sesquiterpenoid base  such as cadinene 

these ambers are polystyrenes 

class iv is something of a wastebasket  its ambers are not polymerized  but mainly consist of cedrene based sesquiterpenoids 

class v resins are considered to be produced by a pine or pine relative  they comprise a mixture of diterpinoid resins and  n  alkyl compounds  their main variety is  highgate copalite  

the oldest amber recovered dates to the upper carboniferous period     its chemical composition makes it difficult to match the amber to its producers     it is most similar to the resins produced by flowering plants  however  there are no flowering plant fossils known from before the cretaceous  and they were not common until the late cretaceous  amber becomes abundant long after the carboniferous  in the early cretaceous    when it is found in association with insects  the oldest amber with arthropod inclusions comes from the levant  from lebanon and jordan  this amber  roughly           million years old  is considered of high scientific value  providing evidence of some of the oldest sampled ecosystems 

in lebanon  more than     outcrops of lower cretaceous amber were discovered by dany azar  a lebanese paleontologist and entomologist  among these outcrops     have yielded biological inclusions comprising the oldest representatives of several recent families of terrestrial arthropods  even older  jurassic amber has been found recently in lebanon as well  many remarkable insects and spiders were recently discovered in the amber of jordan including the oldest zorapterans  clerid beetles  umenocoleid roaches  and achiliid planthoppers 

baltic amber or succinite  historically documented as prussian amber  is found as irregular nodules in marine glauconitic sand  known as  blue earth   occurring in the lower oligocene strata of sambia in prussia  in historical sources also referred to as  glaesaria    after       this territory around k  nigsberg was turned into kaliningrad oblast  russia  where amber is now systematically mined 

it appears  however  to have been partly derived from older eocene deposits and it occurs also as a derivative phase in later formations  such as glacial drift  relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh  suggesting relations with the flora of eastern asia and the southern part of north america  heinrich g  ppert named the common amber yielding pine of the baltic forests  pinites succiniter   but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called  pinus succinifera   it is improbable  however  that the production of amber was limited to a single species  and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber flora 

amber is a unique preservational mode  preserving otherwise unfossilizable parts of organisms  as such it is helpful in the reconstruction of ecosystems as well as organisms  the chemical composition of the resin  however  is of limited utility in reconstructing the phylogenetic affinity of the resin producer 

amber sometimes contains animals or plant matter that became caught in the resin as it was secreted  insects  spiders and even their webs  annelids  frogs  crustaceans  bacteria and amoebae  marine microfossils  wood  flowers and fruit  hair  feathers and other small organisms have been recovered in cretaceous ambers  deposited c     the oldest amber to bear fossils  mites  is from the carnian  triassic    of north eastern italy 

the preservation of prehistoric organisms in amber forms a key plot point in michael crichton s      novel  jurassic park  and the      movie adaptation by steven spielberg  in the story  scientists are able to extract the preserved blood of dinosaurs from prehistoric mosquitoes trapped in amber  from which they genetically clone living dinosaurs  scientifically this is as yet impossible  since no amber with fossilized mosquitoes has ever yielded preserved blood  amber is  however  conducive to preserving dna  since it dehydrates and thus stabilizes organisms trapped inside  one projection in      estimated that dna trapped in amber could last up to     million years  far beyond most estimates of around   million years in the most ideal conditions  although a later      study was unable to extract dna from insects trapped in much more recent holocene copal 

amber has been used since prehistory  solutrean  in the manufacture of jewelry and ornaments  and also in folk medicine 

amber has been used as jewelry since the stone age  from        years ago  amber ornaments have been found in mycenaean tombs and elsewhere across europe  to this day it is used in the manufacture of smoking and glassblowing mouthpieces  amber s place in culture and tradition lends it a tourism value  palanga amber museum is dedicated to the fossilized resin 

amber has long been used in folk medicine for its purported healing properties  amber and extracts were used from the time of hippocrates in ancient greece for a wide variety of treatments through the middle ages and up until the early twentieth century 

amber necklaces have become increasingly popular among parents of babies in the u s  and some other countries due to the mistaken belief that they are an effective colic or teething pain remedy  the american academy of pediatrics and the fda have warned strongly against their use  as they present both a choking and a strangulation hazard  

in ancient china  it was customary to burn amber during large festivities  if amber is heated under the right conditions  oil of amber is produced  and in past times this was combined carefully with nitric acid to create  artificial musk      a resin with a peculiar musky odor  although when burned  amber does give off a characteristic  pinewood  fragrance  modern products  such as perfume  do not normally use actual amber due to the fact that fossilized amber produces very little scent  in perfumery  scents referred to as  amber  are often created and patented
to emulate the opulent golden warmth of the fossil 

the modern name for amber is thought to come from the arabic word  ambar  meaning ambergris  ambergris is the waxy aromatic substance created in the intestines of sperm whales and was used in making perfumes both in ancient times as well as modern 

the scent of amber was originally derived from emulating the scent of ambergris and or the plant resin labdanum  but due to the endangered species status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum  the term  amber  is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm  musky  rich and honey like  and also somewhat earthy  it can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins  when derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum  benzoin is usually part of the recipe  vanilla and cloves are sometimes used to enhance the aroma 

 amber  perfumes may be created using combinations of labdanum  benzoin resin  copal  itself a type of tree resin used in incense manufacture   vanilla  dammara resin and or synthetic materials

plastics  these are used as imitations  







amalaric

amalaric  gothic   amalareiks   or in spanish and portuguese   amalarico               was king of the visigoths from     until his death in battle in      he was a son of king alaric ii and his first wife theodegotha  daughter of theoderic the great 

when alaric ii was killed fighting clovis i  king of the franks  in the battle of vouill          his kingdom fell into disarray   more serious than the destruction of the gothic army   writes herwig wolfram   than the loss of both aquitanian provinces and the capital of toulose  was the death of the king   alaric had made no provision for a successor  and although he had two sons  one was of age but illegitimate and the other  amalaric  the offspring of a legal marriage but still a child  amalaric was carried for safety into spain  which country and provence were thenceforth ruled by his maternal grandfather  theodoric the great  acting through his vice gerent  an ostrogothic nobleman named theudis  the older son  gesalec  was chosen king but his reign was disastrous  king theoderic of the ostrogoths sent an army  led by his sword bearer theudis  against gesalec  ostensibly on behalf of amalaric  gesalec fled to africa  the ostrogoths then drove back the franks and their burgundian allies  regaining possession of  the south of novempopulana  rodez  probably even albi  and even toulose   following the     death of clovis  theoderic negotiated a peace with clovis  successors  securing visigothic control of the southernmost portion of gaul for the rest of the existence of their kingdom 

in     the young amalaric was proclaimed king  and four years later  on theoderic s death  he assumed full royal power  although relinquishing provence to his cousin athalaric  his kingdom was faced with a threat from the north from the franks  according to peter heather  this was his motivation for marrying chrotilda  the daughter of clovis  however  this was not successful  for according to gregory of tours  amalaric pressured her to forsake her roman catholic faith and convert to arian christianity  at one point beating her until she bled  she sent to her brother childebert i  king of paris  a towel stained with her own blood  it is worth noting ian wood s advice that although gregory provides the fullest information for this period  where it touches merovingian affairs  he often  allowed his religious bias to determine his interpretation of the events   peter heather agrees with wood s implication in this instance   i doubt that this is the full story  but the effects of frankish intervention are clear enough  

childebert defeated the visigothic army and took narbonne  amalaric fled south to barcelona  where according to isidore of seville  he was assassinated by his own men  according to peter heather  theoderic s former governor theudis was implicated in amalaric s murder   and was certainly its prime beneficiary   as for chrotilda  in gregory s words she died on the journey home  by some ill chance   childebert had her body brought to paris where she was buried alongside her father clovis 





alphorn

the alphorn or alpenhorn or alpine horn is a labrophone  consisting of a straight several meter long wooden natural horn of conical bore  with a wooden cup shaped mouthpiece  it is used by mountain dwellers in the swiss alps  austrian alps  bavarian alps in germany  french alps  and elsewhere  similar wooden horns were used for communication in most mountainous regions of europe  from the alps to the carpathians  alphorns are today used as musical instruments 

for a long time  scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the roman etruscan lituus  because of their resemblance in shape  and because of the word  liti   meaning alphorn in the dialect of obwalden  there is no documented evidence for this theory  however  and  the word  liti  was probably borrowed from   th     th century writings in latin  where the word  lituus  could describe various wind instruments  such as the horn  the crumhorn  or the cornett  swiss naturalist conrad gesner used the words  lituum alpinum  for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his  de raris et admirandis herbis  in       the oldest known document using the german word  alphorn  is a page from a      account book from the former cistercian abbey st  urban near pfaffnau mentioning the payment of two batzen for an itinerant alphorn player from the valais 

  th     th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since medieval times or earlier  sometimes substituting for the lack of church bells  surviving artifacts  dating back to as far as ca  ad       include wooden labrophones in their stretched form  like the alphorn  or coiled versions  such as the  b  chel  and the  allg  uisches waldhorn  or  ackerhorn   the alphorn s exact origins remain indeterminate  and the ubiquity of horn like signal instruments in valleys throughout europe may indicate a long history of cross influences regarding their construction and usage 

the alphorn is carved from solid softwood  generally spruce but sometimes pine  in former times the alphorn maker would find a tree bent at the base in the shape of an alphorn  but modern makers piece the wood together at the base  a cup shaped mouthpiece carved out of a block of hard wood is added and the instrument is complete 

an alphorn made at rigi kulm  schwyz  and now in the victoria and albert museum  measures in length and has a straight tube  the swiss alphorn varies in shape according to the locality  being curved near the bell in the bernese oberland  michael praetorius mentions an alphorn like instrument under the name of h  lzern trummet  wooden trumpet  in  syntagma musicum   wittenberg               pl  viii  

the alphorn has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure natural harmonic series of the open pipe  the notes of the natural harmonic series overlap  but do not exactly correspond  to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard western equal temperament  most prominently within the alphorn s range  the  th and   th harmonics are particularly noticeable  because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale 
accomplished alphornists often command a range of nearly three octaves  consisting of the  nd through the   th notes of the harmonic series  the availability of the higher tones is due in part to the relatively small diameter of the bore of the mouthpiece and tubing in relation to the overall length of the horn 
the well known  ranz des vaches   score  audio  is a traditional swiss melody often heard on the alphorn  the song describes the time of bringing the cows to the high country at cheese making time  rossini introduced the  ranz des vaches  into his masterpiece  william tell   along with many other delightful melodies scattered throughout the opera in vocal and instrumental parts that are well suited to the alphorn  brahms wrote to clara schumann that the inspiration for the dramatic entry of the horn in the introduction to the last movement of his first symphony was an alphorn melody he heard while vacationing in the rigi area of switzerland 

among music composed for the alphorn 


the alphorn is prominently featured in television advertisements for ricola cough drops  which are manufactured in switzerland 







army

an army  from latin  arma   arms  weapons  via old french  arm  e    armed   feminine   or land force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land  in the broadest sense  it is the land based military branch  service branch or armed service of a nation or state  it may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component  in certain states  the term army refers to the entire armed forces  e g   people s liberation army   within a national military force  the word army may also mean a field army 

in several countries  the army is officially called the land army to differentiate it from an air force called the air army  notably france  in such countries  the word  army  on its own retains its connotation of a land force in common usage  the current largest army in the world  by number of active troops  is the people s liberation army ground force of china with           active troops and         reserve personnel followed by the indian army with           active troops and         reserve personnel 

by convention  irregular military is understood in contrast to regular armies which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite militia  regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines  uniforms  organizations  etc  regular military can also refer to full time status  standing army   versus reserve or part time personnel  other distinctions may separate statutory forces  established under laws such as the national defence act   from de facto  non statutory  forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies  armies may also be expeditionary  designed for overseas or international deployment  or fencible  designed for     or restricted to     homeland defence 

india has had the earliest armies in the world  the first known recorded battles  the war of the    kings  happened when a hindu aryan emperor sudas defeated an alliance of ten kings and their supportive chieftains  during the iron age  the maurya and nanda empires had the largest armies in the world  the peak being approximately over         infantry         cavalry        war chariots and       war elephants not including tributary state allies  in the gupta age  large armies of longbowmen were recruited to fight off invading horse archer armies  elephants  pikemen and cavalry were other featured troops 

in rajput times  the main piece of equipment was iron or chain mail armour  a round shield  either a curved blade or a straight sword  a chakra disc and a katar dagger 

the states of china raised armies for at least      years before the spring and autumn annals  by the warring states period  the crossbow had been perfected enough to become a military secret  with bronze bolts which could pierce any armor  thus any political power of a state rested on the armies and their organization  china underwent political consolidation of the states of han        wei        chu        yan        zhao       and qi        until by     bce  qin shi huang                 the first emperor of the qin dynasty  attained absolute power  this first emperor of china could command the creation of a terracotta army to guard his tomb in the city of xi an           as well as a realignment of the great wall of china to strengthen his empire against insurrection  invasion and incursion 

sun tzu s  the art of war  remains one of china s seven military classics  even though it is two thousand years old  since no political figure could exist without an army  measures were taken to ensure only the most capable leaders could control the armies  civil bureaucracies             arose to control the productive power of the states  and their military power 

the spartan army was one of the earliest known professional armies  boys were sent to a barracks at the age of seven or eight to train for becoming a soldier  at the age of thirty they were released from the barracks and allowed to marry and have a family  after that  men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of     unlike other civilizations  whose armies had to disband during the planting and harvest seasons  the spartan serfs or  helots   did the manual labor 

this allowed the spartans to field a full time army with a campaign season that lasted all year  the spartan army was largely composed of hoplites  equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other  each hoplite bore the spartan emblem and a scarlet uniform  the main pieces of this armor were a round shield  a spear and a helmet 

the roman army had its origins in the citizen army of the republic  which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for rome  reforms turned the army into a professional organization which was still largely filled by citizens  but these citizens served continuously for    years before being discharged 

the romans were also noted for making use of auxiliary troops  non romans who served with the legions and filled roles that the traditional roman military could not fill effectively  such as light skirmish troops and heavy cavalry  after their service in the army they were made citizens of rome and then their children were citizens also  they were also given land and money to settle in rome  in the late roman empire  these auxiliary troops  along with foreign mercenaries  became the core of the roman army  moreover  by the time of the late roman empire tribes such as the visigoths were paid to serve as mercenaries 

in the earliest middle ages it was the obligation of every aristocrat to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment  archers  and infantry  this decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time  but could lead to motley forces with variable training  equipment and abilities  the more resources the noble had access to  the better his troops would be 

initially  the words  knight  and  noble  were used interchangeably as there was not generally a distinction between them  while the nobility did fight upon horseback  they were also supported by lower class citizens     and mercenaries and criminals     whose only purpose was participating in warfare because  most often than not  they held brief employment during their lord s engagement  as the middle ages progressed and feudalism developed in a legitimate social and economic system  knights started to develop into their own class with a minor caveat  they were still in debt to their lord  no longer primarily driven by economic need  the newly established vassal class were  instead  driven by fealty and chivalry 

as central governments grew in power  a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began  as central levies of the peasantry began to be the central recruiting tool  england was one of the most centralized states in the middle ages  and the armies that fought in the hundred years  war were  predominantly  composed of paid professionals 

in theory  every englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days  forty days was not long enough for a campaign  especially one on the continent 

thus the scutage was introduced  whereby most englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army  however  almost all high medieval armies in europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops  and there was a large mercenary market in europe from at least the early   th century 

as the middle ages progressed in italy  italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region  these would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate  mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers  especially in combination with standing forces  but in italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states  this made them considerably less reliable than a standing army  mercenary on mercenary warfare in italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles 

in      the french legislature  known as the estates general  french     tats g  n  raux    passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone  there was a new tax to be raised known as the  taille  that was to provide funding for a new royal army  the mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the royal army as  compagnies d ordonnance  on a permanent basis  or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused  france gained a total standing army of around       men  which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own  the new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors  the reforms of the     s  eventually led to the french victory at castillon in       and the conclusion of the hundred years  war  by      the companies were divided into the field army  known as the  grande ordonnance  and the garrison force known as the  petite ordonnance   

first nation states lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces  so they tended to hire mercenaries to serve in their armies during wartime  such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict  when men at arms were no longer needed by their respective governments 

the veteran soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment  often becoming mercenaries  free companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia 

as late as the     s  most troops were mercenaries  however  after the   th century  most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops  for a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators  but soon these tasks were also taken by the state  the massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators 

the newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies  which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state  the combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across europe such as the fronde in france and the english civil war 

in many countries  the resolution of this conflict was the rise of absolute monarchy  only in england and the netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative  from the late   th century  states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions  the first state to master this process was the dutch republic  this transformation in the armies of europe had great social impact  the defense of the state now rested on the commoners  not on the aristocrats 

however  aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies  including their high command  moreover  popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes  the new armies  because of their vast expense  were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society  the great commercial powers of the dutch and english matched much larger states in military might 

as any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket  it became far easier to form massive armies  the inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers  this led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies  for the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat  rather than just the highly skilled professionals 

it has been argued that the drawing of men from across the nation into an organized corps helped breed national unity and patriotism  and during this period the modern notion of the nation state was born  however  this would only become apparent after the french revolutionary wars  at this time  the  lev  e en masse  and conscription would become the defining paradigm of modern warfare 

before then  however  most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities  in spain armies were recruited from all the spanish european territories including spain  italy  wallonia  walloon guards  and germany  the french recruited some soldiers from germany  switzerland as well as from piedmont  britain recruited hessian and hanovrian troops until the late   th century  irish catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many catholic european states 

prior to the english civil war in england  the monarch maintained a personal bodyguard of yeomen of the guard and the honourable corps of gentlemen at arms  or  gentlemen pensioners   and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as berwick on tweed or portsmouth  or calais before it was recaptured by france in       

troops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an  ad hoc  basis  noblemen and professional regular soldiers were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops  raising their quotas by indenture from a variety of sources  on january          charles ii issued the royal warrant that created the genesis of what would become the british army  although the scottish and english armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of england and scotland in       the small force was represented by only a few regiments 

after the american revolutionary war the continental army was quickly disbanded as part of the americans  distrust of standing armies  and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the united states  with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding west point s arsenal  then first american regiment was established in       however  because of continuing conflict with native americans  it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army  the first of these  the legion of the united states  was established in      

until      the common soldiers of prussian army consisted largely of peasantry recruited or impressed from brandenburg   prussia  leading many to flee to neighboring countries  to halt this trend  frederick william i divided prussia into regimental cantons  every youth was required to serve as a soldier in these recruitment districts for three months each year  this met agrarian needs and added extra troops to bolster the regular ranks 

russian tsars before peter i of russia maintained professional hereditary musketeer corps  streltsy in russian  that were highly unreliable and undisciplined  in times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants  peter i introduced a modern regular army built on german model  but with a new aspect  officers not necessarily from nobility  as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officer s rank  conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system  per settlement  initially it was based on the number of households  later it was based on the population numbers  the term of service in the   th century was for life  in      it was reduced to    years  in      it was reduced to    years plus   years in reserve and in      to    years plus   years of reserve 

the first ottoman standing army were janissaries  they replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors   ghazis   whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted  the first janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves  probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one fifth share of his army s booty in kind rather than cash 

from the     s onwards  their ranks were filled under the  dev  irme  system  where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan  the  recruits  were mostly christian youths  reminiscent of mamluks 

china organized the manchu people into the eight banner system in the early   th century  defected ming armies formed the green standard army  these troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service 

conscription allowed the french republic to form the  la grande arm  e   what napoleon bonaparte called  the nation in arms   which successfully battled european professional armies 

conscription  particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation  has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies 

canada also had a political dispute over conscription during world war ii  similarly  mass protests against conscription to fight the vietnam war occurred in several countries in the late     s 

in developed nations  the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better trained fighting forces  the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations  as well as memories of the contentiousness of the vietnam war experience  make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future 

russia  as well as many other nations  retains mainly a conscript army  there is also a very rare  citizen army  as used in switzerland  see military of switzerland  

western armies are usually subdivided as follows 

a field army is composed of a headquarters  army troops  a variable number of corps  typically between three and four  and a variable number of divisions  also between three and four  a battle is influenced at the field army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point  field armies are controlled by a general or lieutenant general 

a particular army can be named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general  for example  the first united states army and the army of northern virginia  in the british army it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army  e g  first army   whereas lower formations use figures  e g   st division  

armies  as well as army groups and theaters  are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size  composition  and scope of responsibility 

in the soviet red army and the soviet air force   armies  could vary in size  but were subordinate to an army group sized  front  in wartime  in peacetime  a soviet army was usually subordinate to a military district  viktor suvorov s  inside the soviet army  describes how cold war era soviet military districts were actually composed of a front headquarters and a military district headquarters co located for administration and deception   maskirovika   reasons 





alligatoridae

the family alligatoridae of crocodylians includes alligators and caimans 

the superfamily alligatoroidea includes all crocodilians  fossil and extant  that are more closely related to the american alligator than to either the nile crocodile or the gharial 

members of this superfamily first arose in the late cretaceous   leidyosuchus  of alberta is the earliest known genus  fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout eurasia as land bridges across both the north atlantic and the bering strait have connected north america to eurasia during the cretaceous  paleogene  and neogene periods  alligators and caimans split in north america during the late cretaceous and the latter reached south america by the paleogene  before the closure of the isthmus of panama during the neogene period  the chinese alligator likely descended from a lineage that crossed the bering land bridge during the neogene  the modern american alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the pleistocene  the alligator s full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the     s and it suggests the animal evolved at a rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and most cold blooded vertebrates  the full genome  published in       suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds 

the lineage including alligators proper  alligatorinae  occurs in the fluvial deposits of the age of the upper chalk in europe  where they did not die out until the pliocene age  the true alligators are today represented by two species   a  mississippiensis  in the southeastern united states  which can grow to     ft       m  and weigh       lbs       kg  and the small  a  sinensis  in the yangtze river  china  which grows to an average of    ft       m   their name derives from the spanish  el lagarto   which means  the lizard  

in central and south america  the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily caimaninae  which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils  and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony scutes  each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture  besides the three species in  caiman   the smooth fronted caimans in genus  paleosuchus  and the black caiman in  melanosuchus  are described  caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile like in their movements  and have longer  sharper teeth than alligators 

 c  crocodilus   the spectacled caiman  has the widest distribution  from southern mexico to the northern half of argentina  and grows to a modest size of about   the largest is the near threatened  melanosuchus niger   the  jacare assu  or large or black caiman of the amazon river basin  black caimans grow to   with the largest recorded size   the black caiman and american alligator are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the crocodile family 

although caimans have not been studied in depth  scientists have learned their mating cycles  previously thought to be spontaneous or year round  are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels  which increases chances of survival for their offspring 

alligators differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads  with more obtuse snouts  in having the fourth  enlarged tooth of the under jaw received  not into an external notch  but into a pit formed for it within the upper one  in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the crocodile  in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips  and an intolerance to salinity  alligators strongly preferring fresh water  while crocodiles can tolerate salt water due to specialized glands for filtering out salt  in general  crocodiles tend to be more dangerous to humans than alligators  another recently discovered trait is that of both caimans and american alligators partaking of foliage and fruit in addition to their normal diet of fish and meat 






alder

alder is the common name of a genus of flowering plants  alnus  belonging to the birch family betulaceae  the genus comprises about    species of monoecious trees and shrubs  a few reaching a large size  distributed throughout the north temperate zone with a few species extending into central america  as well as the northern and southern andes 

the common name  alder  evolved from old english  alor   which in turn is derived from proto germanic root  aliso   the generic name  alnus  is the equivalent latin name  both the latin and the germanic words derive from the proto indo european root  el    meaning  red  or  brown   which is also a root for the english words  elk  and another tree   elm   a tree distantly related to the alders 

with a few exceptions  alders are deciduous  and the leaves are alternate  simple  and serrated  the flowers are catkins with elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female catkins  often before leaves appear  they are mainly wind pollinated  but also visited by bees to a small extent  these trees differ from the birches   betula   another genus in the family  in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity  opening to release the seeds in a similar manner to many conifer cones 

the largest species are red alder   a  rubra   on the west coast of north america  and black alder   a  glutinosa    native to most of europe and widely introduced elsewhere  both reaching over    m  by contrast  the widespread  alnus viridis   green alder  is rarely more than a   m tall shrub 

alders are commonly found near streams  rivers  and wetlands  in the pacific northwest of north america  the white alder  alnus rhombifolia  unlike other northwest alders  has an affinity for warm  dry climates  where it grows along watercourses  such as along the lower columbia river east of the cascades and the snake river  including hells canyon 

alder leaves and sometimes catkins are used as food by numerous butterflies and moths 

 a  glutinosa  and  a  viridis  are classed as environmental weeds in new zealand  alder leaves and especially the roots are important to the ecosystem because they enrich the soil with nitrogen and other nutrients 

alder is particularly noted for its important symbiotic relationship with  frankia alni   an actinomycete  filamentous  nitrogen fixing bacterium  this bacterium is found in root nodules  which may be as large as a human fist  with many small lobes  and light brown in colour  the bacterium absorbs nitrogen from the air and makes it available to the tree  alder  in turn  provides the bacterium with sugars  which it produces through photosynthesis  as a result of this mutually beneficial relationship  alder improves the fertility of the soil where it grows  and as a pioneer species  it helps provide additional nitrogen for the successional species which follow 
because of its abundance  red alder delivers large amounts of nitrogen to enrich forest soils  red alder stands have been found to supply between     and     pounds of nitrogen per acre      to      kg per ha  annually to the soil  from alaska to oregon   alnus viridis  subsp   sinuata    a  sinuata   sitka alder or slide alder   characteristically pioneer fresh  gravelly sites at the foot of retreating glaciers  studies show that sitka alder  a more shrubby variety of alder  adds nitrogen to the soil at an average of    pounds per acre     per ha  per year  helping convert the sterile glacial terrain to soil capable of supporting a conifer forest  alders are common among the first species to colonize disturbed areas from floods  windstorms  fires  landslides  etc  alder groves themselves often serve as natural firebreaks since these broad leaved trees are much less flammable than conifers  their foliage and leaf litter does not carry a fire well  and their thin bark is sufficiently resistant to protect them from light surface fires  in addition  the light weight of alder seeds          per pound  or     million per kg  allows for easy dispersal by the wind  although it outgrows coastal douglas fir for the first    years  it is very shade intolerant and seldom lives more than     years  red alder is the pacific northwest s largest alder and the most plentiful and commercially important broad leaved tree in the coastal northwest  groves of red alder    to    inches     to     cm  in diameter intermingle with young douglas fir forests west of the cascades  attaining a maximum height of     to     feet     to    m  in about sixty years and then lose vigor as heart rot sets in  alders largely help create conditions favorable for giant conifers that replace them 

alder roots are parasitized by northern groundcone 

the catkins of some alder species have a degree of edibility  and may be rich in protein  reported to have a bitter and unpleasant taste  they are more useful for survival purposes  the wood of certain alder species is often used to smoke various food items such as coffee  salmon and other seafood 

most of the pilings that form the foundation of venice were made from alder trees 

alder bark contains the anti inflammatory salicin  which is metabolized into salicylic acid in the body  some native american cultures use red alder bark   alnus rubra   to treat poison oak  insect bites  and skin irritations  blackfeet indians have traditionally used an infusion made from the bark of red alder to treat lymphatic disorders and tuberculosis  recent clinical studies have verified that red alder contains betulin and lupeol  compounds shown to be effective against a variety of tumors 

the inner bark of the alder  as well as red osier dogwood  or chokecherry  is used by some indigenous peoples of the americas in smoking mixtures  known as  kinnikinnick   to improve the taste of the bearberry leaf 

alder is illustrated in the coat of arms for the austrian town of grossarl 

electric guitars  most notably those manufactured by the fender musical instruments corporation  have been built with alder bodies since the     s  alder is appreciated for its claimed tight and even balanced tone  especially when compared to mahogany  and has been adopted by many electric guitar manufacturers 

as a hardwood  alder is used in making furniture  cabinets  and other woodworking products  for example  in the television series  northern exposure  season   episode  things become extinct          native american ira wingfeather makes duck flutes out of alder tree branches while ed chigliak films 

alder bark and wood  like oak and sweet chestnut  contain tannin and are traditionally used to tan leather 

a red dye can also be extracted from the outer bark  and a yellow dye from the inner bark 

the genus is divided into three subgenera 

subgenus  alnus   trees with stalked shoot buds  male and female catkins produced in autumn  fall  but stay closed over winter  pollinating in late winter or early spring  about         species  including 




subgenus  clethropsis   trees or shrubs with stalked shoot buds  male and female catkins produced in autumn  fall  and expanding and pollinating then  three species

amos bronson alcott    november         march          was an american teacher  writer  philosopher  and reformer  as an educator  alcott pioneered new ways of interacting with young students  focusing on a conversational style  and avoided traditional punishment  he hoped to perfect the human spirit and  to that end  advocated a vegan diet before the term was coined  he was also an abolitionist and an advocate for women s rights 

born in wolcott  connecticut in       alcott had only minimal formal schooling before attempting a career as a traveling salesman  worried about how the itinerant life might have a negative impact on his soul  he turned to teaching  his innovative methods  however  were controversial  and he rarely stayed in one place very long  his most well known teaching position was at the temple school in boston  his experience there was turned into two books   records of a school  and  conversations with children on the gospels   alcott became friends with ralph waldo emerson and became a major figure in transcendentalism  his writings on behalf of that movement  however  are heavily criticized for being incoherent  based on his ideas for human perfection  alcott founded fruitlands  a transcendentalist experiment in community living  the project was short lived and failed after seven months  alcott continued to struggle financially for most of his life  nevertheless  he continued focusing on educational projects and opened a new school at the end of his life in       he died in      

alcott married abby may in      and they eventually had four surviving children  all daughters  their second was louisa may  who fictionalized her experience with the family in her novel  little women  in      

a native new englander  amos bronson alcott was born in wolcott  connecticut  then recently renamed from  farmingbury   on november           his parents were joseph chatfield alcott and anna bronson alcott  the family home was in an area known as spindle hill  and his father  joseph alcox  traced his ancestry to colonial era settlers in eastern massachusetts  the family originally spelled their name  alcock   later changed to  alcocke  then  alcox   amos bronson  the oldest of eight children  later changed the spelling to  alcott  and dropped his first name 
at age six  young bronson began his formal education in a one room schoolhouse in the center of town but learned how to read at home with the help of his mother  the school taught only reading  writing  and spelling and he left this school at the age of     at age     his uncle  reverend tillotson bronson  invited alcott into his home in cheshire  connecticut  to be educated and prepared for college  bronson gave it up after only a month and was self educated from then on  he was not particularly social and his only close friend was his neighbor and second cousin william alcott  with whom he shared books and ideas  bronson alcott later reflected on his childhood at spindle hill   it kept me pure    i dwelt amidst the hills    god spoke to me while i walked the fields   starting at age     he took a job working for clockmaker seth thomas in the nearby town of plymouth 

at age     alcott passed the exam for a teaching certificate but had trouble finding work as a teacher  instead  he left home and became a traveling salesman in the american south  peddling books and merchandise  he hoped the job would earn him enough money to support his parents   to make their cares  and burdens less    and get them free from debt   though he soon spent most of his earnings on a new suit  at first  he thought it an acceptable occupation but soon worried about his spiritual well being  in march       alcott wrote to his brother   peddling is a hard place to serve god  but a capital one to serve mammon   near the end of his life  he fictionalized this experience in his book   new connecticut   originally circulated only among friends before its publication in      

by the summer of       alcott returned to connecticut in debt to his father  who bailed him out after his last two unsuccessful sales trips  he took a job as a schoolteacher in cheshire with the help of his uncle tillotson  he quickly set about reforming the school  he added backs to the benches on which students sat  improved lighting and heating  de emphasized rote learning  and provided individual slates to each student   paid for by himself  alcott had been influenced by educational philosophy of the swiss pedagogue johann heinrich pestalozzi and even renamed his school  the cheshire pestalozzi school   his style attracted the attention of samuel joseph may  who introduced alcott to his sister abby may  she called him   an intelligent  philosophic  modest man  and found his views on education  very attractive   locals in cheshire were less supportive and became suspicious of his methods  many students left and were enrolled in the local common school or a recently re opened private school for boys  on november          alcott started teaching in bristol  connecticut  still using the same methods he used in cheshire  but opposition from the community surfaced quickly  he was unemployed by march       he moved to boston on april           and was immediately impressed  referring to the city as a place  where the light of the sun of righteousness has risen   he opened the salem street infant school two months later on june     abby may applied as his teaching assistant  instead  the couple were engaged  without consent of the family  they were married at king s chapel on may           he was    years old and she was     her brother conducted the ceremony and a modest reception followed at her father s house  after their marriage the alcotts moved to    franklin street in boston  a boarding house run by a mrs  newall  around this time  alcott also first expressed his public disdain for slavery  in november       he and william lloyd garrison founded what he later called a  preliminary anti slavery society   though he differed from garrison as a nonresistant  alcott became a member of the boston vigilance committee 

attendance at alcott s school was falling  a wealthy quaker named reuben haines proposed he and educator william russell start a new school in pennsylvania associated with the germantown academy  alcott accepted and he and his newly pregnant wife set forth on december     the school was established in germantown and the alcotts were offered a rent free home by haines  alcott and russell were initially concerned that the area would not be conducive to their progressive approach to education and considered establishing the school in nearby philadelphia instead  unsuccessful  they went back to germantown  though the rent free home was no longer available and the alcotts instead had to rent rooms in a boarding house  it was there that their first child  a daughter they named anna bronson alcott  was born on march           after    hours of labor  by the fall of that year  their benefactor haines died suddenly and the alcotts again suffered financial difficulty   we hardly earn the bread   wrote abby may to her brother    and  the butter we have to think about  

the couple s only son was born on april          but lived only a few minutes  the mother recorded   gave birth to a fine boy full grown perfectly formed but not living   it was in germantown that the couple s second daughter was born  louisa may alcott was born on her father s birthday  november           at a half hour past midnight  bronson described her as  a very fine healthful child  much more so than anna was at birth   the germantown school  however  was faltering  soon only eight pupils remained  their benefactor haines died before louisa s birth  he had helped recruit students and even paid tuition for some of them  as abby wrote  his death  has prostrated all our hopes here   on april           the family moved to philadelphia  where alcott ran a day school  as usual  alcott s methods were controversial  a former student later referred to him as  the most eccentric man who ever took on himself to train and form the youthful mind   alcott began to believe boston was the best place for his ideas to flourish  he contacted theologian william ellery channing for support  channing approved of alcott s methods and promised to help find students to enroll  including his daughter mary  channing also secured aid from justice lemuel shaw and boston mayor josiah quincy  jr 

on september           alcott opened a school of about    students  mostly from wealthy families  it was named the temple school because classes were held at the masonic temple on tremont street in boston  his assistant was elizabeth palmer peabody  later replaced by margaret fuller  mary peabody mann served as a french instructor for a time  the school was briefly famous  and then infamous  because of his original methods  before       writing  except in higher education  equated to rote drills in the rules of grammar  spelling  vocabulary  penmanship and transcription of adult texts  however  in that decade  progressive reformers such as alcott  influenced by pestalozzi as well as friedrich fr  bel and johann friedrich herbart  began to advocate writing about subjects from students  personal experiences  reformers debated against beginning instruction with rules and were in favor of helping students learn to write by expressing the personal meaning of events within their own lives  alcott s plan was to develop self instruction on the basis of self analysis  with an emphasis on conversation and questioning rather than lecturing and drill  which were prevalent in the u s  classrooms of the time  alongside writing and reading  he gave lessons in  spiritual culture   which included interpretation of the gospels  and advocated  object teaching  in writing instruction  he even went so far as to decorate his schoolroom with visual elements he thought would inspire learning  paintings  books  comfortable furniture  and busts or portraits of plato  socrates  jesus  and william ellery channing 

during this time  the alcotts had another child  born on june           she was named elizabeth peabody alcott in honor of the teaching assistant at the temple school  by age three  however  her mother changed her name to elizabeth  sewall  alcott  after her own mother 
in july       peabody published her account as an assistant to the temple school as  record of a school  exemplifying the general principles of spiritual culture   while working on a second book  alcott and peabody had a falling out and  conversations with children on the gospels  was prepared with help from peabody s sister sophia  published at the end of december       alcott s methods were not well received  many found his conversations on the gospels close to blasphemous  for example  he asked students to question if biblical miracles were literal and suggested that all people are part of god  in the  boston daily advertiser   nathan hale criticized alcott s  flippant and off hand conversation  about serious topics from the virgin birth of jesus to circumcision  joseph t  buckingham called alcott  either insane or half witted  and  an ignorant and presuming charlatan   the book did not sell well  a boston lawyer bought     copies to use as waste paper 

the temple school was widely denounced in the press  reverend james freeman clarke was one of alcott s few supporters and defended him against the harsh response from boston periodicals  alcott was rejected by most public opinion and  by the summer of       he had only    students left and no assistant after margaret fuller moved to providence  rhode island  the controversy had caused many parents to remove their children and  as the school closed  alcott became increasingly financially desperate  remaining steadfast to his pedagogy  a forerunner of progressive and democratic schooling  he alienated parents in a later  parlor school  by admitting an african american child to the class  whom he then refused to expel in the face of protests 

beginning in       alcott s membership in the transcendental club put him in such company as ralph waldo emerson  orestes brownson and theodore parker  he became a member with the club s second meeting and hosted their third  a biographer of emerson described the group as  the occasional meetings of a changing body of liberal thinkers  agreeing in nothing but their liberality   frederic henry hedge wrote of the group s nature   there was no club in the strict sense    only occasional meetings of like minded men and women   alcott preferred the term  symposium  for their group 

in late april       alcott moved to the town of concord urged by emerson  he rented a home for     a year within walking distance of emerson s house  he named it dove cottage  though they also called it concordia cottage  a supporter of alcott s philosophies  emerson offered to help with his writing  which proved a difficult task  after several revisions  for example  he deemed the essay  psyche   alcott s account of how he educated his daughters  unpublishable  alcott also wrote a series patterned after the work of german writer johann wolfgang von goethe which were eventually published in the transcendentalists  journal   the dial   emerson wrote to margaret fuller  then editor  that they might  pass muster   even pass for just   great   he was wrong  alcott s so called  orphic sayings  were widely mocked for being silly and unintelligible  fuller herself disliked them  but did not want to hurt alcott s feelings  in the first issue  for example  he wrote 
on july           abby may gave birth again  originally referred to as baby for several months  she was eventually named abby may after her mother  as a teenager  she changed the spelling of her name to  abbie  before choosing to use only  may  

with financial support from emerson  alcott left concord on may          to a visit to england  leaving his brother junius with his family  he met two admirers  charles lane and henry c  wright  the two men were leaders of alcott house  an experimental school based on alcott s methods from the temple school located about ten miles outside london  the school s founder  james pierpont greaves  had only recently died but alcott was invited to stay there for a week  alcott persuaded them to come to the united states with him  lane and his son moved into the alcott house and helped with family chores  persuaded in part by lane s abolitionist views  alcott took a stand against the john tyler administration s plan to annex texas as a slave territory and refused to pay his poll tax  abby may wrote in her journal on january            a day of some excitement  as mr  alcott refused to pay his town tax    after waiting some time to be committed  to jail   he was told it was paid by a friend  thus we were spared the affliction of his absence and the triumph of suffering for his principles   the annual poll tax was only        the incident inspired henry david thoreau  whose similar protest led to a night in jail and his essay  civil disobedience   around this time  the alcott family set up a sort of domestic post office to curb potential domestic tension  abby may described her idea   i thought it would afford a daily opportunity for the children  indeed all of us  to interchange thought and sentiment  

lane and alcott collaborated on a major expansion of their educational theories into a utopian society  alcott  however  was still in debt and could not purchase the land needed for their planned community  in a letter  lane wrote   i do not see anyone to act the money part but myself   in may       he purchased a farm in harvard  massachusetts  up front  he paid        of the total        value of the property  the rest was meant to be paid by the alcotts over a two year period  they moved to the farm on june   and optimistically named it  fruitlands  despite only ten old apple trees on the property  in july  alcott announced their plans in  the dial    we have made an arrangement with the proprietor of an estate of about a hundred acres  which liberates this tract from human ownership  

their goal was to regain access to eden by finding the correct formula for perfect living  following specific rules governing agriculture  diet  and reproduction  in order to achieve this  they removed themselves from the economy as much as possible and lived independently  unlike a similar project named brook farm  the participants at fruitlands avoided interaction with local communities  calling themselves a  consociate family   they agreed to follow a strict vegetarian diet and to till the land without the use of animal labor  after some difficulty  they relented and allowed some cattle to be  enslaved   they also banned coffee  tea  alcoholic drinks  milk  and warm bathwater  they only ate  aspiring vegetables    those which grew upward   and refused those that grew downward like potatoes  as alcott had published earlier   our wine is water    flesh  bread    drugs  fruits   for clothing  they prohibited leather because animals were killed for it  as well as cotton  silk  and wool  because they were products of slave labor  alcott had high expectations but was often away when the community most needed him as he attempted to recruit more members 

the experimental community was never successful  partly because most of the land was not arable  alcott lamented   none of us were prepared to actualize practically the ideal life of which we dreamed  so we fell apart   its founders were often away as well  in the middle of harvesting  they left for a lecture tour through providence  rhode island  new york city  and new haven  connecticut  in its seven months  only    people joined  included the alcotts and lanes  other than abby may and her daughters  only one other woman joined  ann page  one rumor is that page was asked to leave after eating a fish tail with a neighbor  lane believed alcott had misled him into thinking enough people would join the enterprise and developed a strong dislike for the nuclear family  he quit the project and moved to a nearby shaker family with his son  after lane s departure  alcott fell into a depression and could not speak or eat for three days  abby may thought lane purposely sabotaged her family  she wrote to her brother   all mr  lane s efforts have been to disunite us  but mr  alcott s     paternal instincts were too strong for him   when the final payment on the farm was owed  sam may refused to cover his brother in law s debts  as he often did  possibly at abby may s suggestion  the experiment failed  the alcotts had to leave fruitlands 

the members of the alcott family were not happy with their fruitlands experience  at one point  abby may threatened that she and their daughters would move elsewhere  leaving bronson behind  louisa may alcott  who was ten years old at the time  later wrote of the experience in  transcendental wild oats           the band of brothers began by spading garden and field  but a few days of it lessened their ardor amazingly  

in january       alcott moved his family to still river  a village within harvard but  on march          the family returned to concord to live in a home they named  the hillside   later renamed  the wayside  by nathaniel hawthorne   both emerson and sam may assisted in securing the home for the alcotts  while living in the home  louisa began writing in earnest and was given her own room  she later said her years at the home  were the happiest years  of her life  many of the incidents in her novel  little women         are based on this period  alcott renovated the property  moving a barn and painting the home a rusty olive color  as well as tending to over six acres of land  on may           abby may was granted a sum from her father s estate which was put into a trust fund  granting minor financial security  that summer  bronson alcott let henry david thoreau borrow his ax to prepare his home at walden pond 

the alcotts hosted a steady stream of visitors at the hillside  including fugitive slaves  which they hosted in secret as a station of the underground railroad  alcott s opposition to slavery also fueled his opposition to the mexican   american war which began in       he considered the war a blatant attempt to extend slavery and asked if the country was made up of  a people bent on conquest  on getting the golden treasures of mexico into our hands  and of subjugating foreign peoples  

in       abby may insisted they leave concord  which she called  cold  heartless  brainless  soulless   the alcott family put the hillside up for rent and moved to boston  there  next door to peabody s book store on west street  bronson alcott hosted a series based on the  conversations  model by margaret fuller called  a course on the conversations on man   his history  resources  and expectations   participants  both men and women  were charged three dollars to attend or five dollars for all seven lectures  in march       alcott was invited to teach fifteen students at harvard divinity school in an extracurricular  non credit course 

alcott and his family moved back to concord after       where he and his family lived in the orchard house until       in       alcott was named superintendent of concord schools 

alcott voted in a presidential election for the first time in       in his journal for november          he wrote   at town house  and cast my vote for lincoln and the republican candidates generally   the first vote i ever cast for a president and state officers   alcott was an abolitionist and a friend of the more radical william lloyd garrison  he had attended a rally led by wendell phillips on behalf of    year old thomas sims  a fugitive slave on trial in boston  alcott was one of several who attempted to storm the courthouse  when gunshots were heard  he was the only one who stood his ground  though the effort was unsuccessful  he had also stood his ground in a protest against the trial of anthony burns  a group had broken down the door of the boston courthouse but guards beat them back  alcott stood forward and asked the leader of the group  thomas wentworth higginson   why are we not within   he then walked calmly into the courthouse  was threatened with a gun  and turned back   but without hastening a step   according to higginson 

in       louisa moved to washington  d c  to volunteer as a nurse  on january           the alcotts received a telegram that louisa was sick  bronson immediately went to bring her home  briefly meeting abraham lincoln while there  louisa turned her experience into the book  hospital sketches   her father wrote of it   i see nothing in the way of a good appreciation of louisa s merits as a woman and a writer  

henry david thoreau died on may          likely from an illness he caught from alcott two years earlier  
at emerson s request  alcott helped arrange thoreau s funeral  which was held at first parish sanctuary in concord  despite thoreau having disavowed membership in the church when he was in his early twenties  emerson wrote a eulogy  and alcott helped plan the preparations  only two years later  neighbor nathaniel hawthorne died as well  alcott served as a pallbearer along with louis agassiz  james thomas fields  oliver wendell holmes  sr   henry wadsworth longfellow  and others  with hawthorne s death  alcott worried that few of the concord notables remained  he recorded in his journal   fair figures one by one are fading from sight   the next year  lincoln was assassinated  which alcott called  appalling news  

in       alcott met with publisher thomas niles  an admirer of  hospital sketches   alcott asked niles if he would publish a book of short stories by his daughter  instead  he suggested she write a book about girls  louisa may was not interested initially but agreed to try   they want a book of     pages or more   alcott told his daughter  the result was  little women   published later that year  the book  which fictionalized the alcott family during the girls  coming of age years  recast the father figure as a chaplain  away from home at the front in the civil war 

alcott spoke  as opportunity arose  before the  lyceums  then common in various parts of the united states  or addressed groups of hearers as they invited him  these  conversations  as he called them  were more or less informal talks on a great range of topics  spiritual  aesthetic and practical  in which he emphasized the ideas of the school of american transcendentalists led by emerson  who was always his supporter and discreet admirer  he often discussed platonic philosophy  the illumination of the mind and soul by direct communion with spirit  upon the spiritual and poetic monitions of external nature  and upon the benefit to man of a serene mood and a simple way of life 

alcott s published books  all from late in his life  include  tablets           concord days           new connecticut          and  sonnets and canzonets          louisa may attended to her father s needs in his final years  she purchased a house for her sister anna which had been the last home of henry david thoreau  now known as the thoreau alcott house  louisa and her parents moved in with anna as well 

after the death of his wife abby may on november           alcott never returned to orchard house  too heartbroken to live there  he and louisa may collaborated on a memoir and went over her papers  letters  and journals   my heart bleeds with the memories of those days   he wrote   and even long years  of cheerless anxiety and hopeless dependence   louisa noted her father had become  restless with his anchor gone   they gave up on the memoir project and louisa burned many of her mother s papers 

on january           alcott and franklin benjamin sanborn wrote a prospectus for a new school which they distributed to potentially interested people throughout the country  the result was the concord school of philosophy and literature  which held its first session in      in alcott s study in the orchard house  in      the school moved to the hillside chapel  a building next to the house  where he held conversations and  over the course of successive summers  as he entered his eighties  invited others to give lectures on themes in philosophy  religion and letters  the school  considered one of the first formal adult education centers in america  was also attended by foreign scholars  it continued for nine years 

in april       alcott s friend and benefactor ralph waldo emerson was sick and bedridden  after visiting him  alcott wrote   concord will be shorn of its human splendor when he withdraws behind the cloud   emerson died the next day  alcott himself moved out of concord for his final years  settling at    louisburg square in boston beginning in      

as he was bedridden at the end of his life  alcott s daughter louisa may came to visit him at louisburg on march          he said to her   i am going  up  come with me    she responded   i wish i could   he died three days later on march    louisa may died only two days after her father 

alcott was fundamentally and philosophically opposed to corporal punishment as a means of disciplining his students  instead  beginning at the temple school  he would appoint a daily student superintendent  when that student observed an infraction  he or she reported it to the rest of the class and  as a whole  they deliberated on punishment  at times  alcott offered his own hand for an offending student to strike  saying that any failing was the teacher s responsibility  the shame and guilt this method induced  he believed  was far superior to the fear instilled by corporal punishment  when he used physical  correction  he required that the students be unanimously in support of its application  even including the student to be punished 

the most detailed discussion of his theories on education is in an essay   observations on the principles and methods of infant instruction   alcott believed that early education must draw out  unpremeditated thoughts and feelings of the child  and emphasized that infancy should primarily focus on enjoyment  he noted that learning was not about the acquisition of facts but the development of a reflective state of mind 

alcott s ideas as an educator were controversial  writer harriet martineau  for example  wrote dubiously that   the master presupposes his little pupils possessed of all truth  and that his business is to bring it out into expression   even so  his ideas helped to found one of the first adult education centers in america  and provided the foundation for future generations of liberal education  many of alcott s educational principles are still used in classrooms today  including  teach by encouragement   art education  music education  acting exercises  learning through experience  risk taking in the classroom  tolerance in schools  physical education recess  and early childhood education  the teachings of william ellery channing a few years earlier had also laid the groundwork for the work of most of the concord transcendentalists 

the concord school of philosophy  which closed following alcott s death in       was reopened almost    years later in the     s  it has continued functioning with a summer conversational series in its original building at orchard house  now run by the louisa may alcott memorial association 

while many of alcott s ideas continue to be perceived as being on the liberal radical edge  they are still common themes in society  including vegetarian veganism  sustainable living  and temperance self control  alcott described his sustenance as a  pythagorean diet   meat  eggs  butter  cheese  and milk were excluded and drinking was confined to well water  alcott believed that diet held the key to human perfection and connected physical well being to mental improvement  he further viewed a perfection of nature to the spirit and  in a sense  predicted modern environmentalism by condemning pollution and encouraging humankind s role in sustaining ecology 

alcott s philosophical teachings have been criticized as inconsistent  hazy or abrupt  he formulated no system of philosophy  and shows the influence of plato  german mysticism  and immanuel kant as filtered through the writings of samuel taylor coleridge  margaret fuller referred to alcott as  a philosopher of the balmy times of ancient greece   a man whom the worldlings of boston hold in as much horror as the worldlings of athens held socrates   in his later years  alcott related a story from his boyhood  during a total solar eclipse  he threw rocks at the sky until he fell and dislocated his shoulder  he reflected that the event was a prophecy that he would be  tilting at the sun and always catching the fall  

like emerson  alcott was always optimistic  idealistic  and individualistic in thinking  writer james russell lowell referred to alcott in his poem  studies for two heads  as  an angel with clipped wings   even so  emerson noted that alcott s brilliant conversational ability did not translate into good writing   when he sits down to write   emerson wrote   all his genius leaves him  he gives you the shells and throws away the kernel of his thought   his  orphic sayings   published in  the dial   became famous for their hilarity as dense  pretentious  and meaningless  in new york  for example   the knickerbocker  published a parody titled  gastric sayings  in november       a writer for the  boston post  referred to alcott s  orphic sayings  as  a train of fifteen railroad cars with one passenger  

modern critics often fault alcott for not being able to financially support his family  alcott himself worried about his own prospects as a young man  once writing to his mother that he was  still at my old trade   hoping   alcott held his principles above his well being  shortly before his marriage  for example  his future father in law colonel joseph may helped him find a job teaching at a school in boston run by the society of free enquirers  followers of robert owen  for a lucrative        to        annual salary  he refused it because he did not agree with their beliefs  writing   i shall have nothing to do with them  

from the other perspective  alcott s unique teaching ideas created an environment which produced two famous daughters in different fields  in a time when women were not commonly encouraged to have independent careers 







arachnophobia

arachnophobia is the unreasonable fear of spiders and other arachnids such as scorpions 

treatment is typically by exposure therapy  where the person is presented with pictures of spiders or the spiders themselves 

people with arachnophobia tend to feel uneasy in any area they believe could harbor spiders or that has visible signs of their presence  such as webs  if arachnophobics see a spider  they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the panic attack that is often associated with their phobia  some people scream  cry  have emotional outbursts  experience trouble breathing  sweat  have heart palpitations  or even faint when they come in contact with an area near spiders or their webs  in some extreme cases  even a picture or a realistic drawing of a spider can trigger intense fear 

arachnophobia may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive  or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly european societies 

an evolutionary reason for the phobia remains unresolved  one view  especially held in evolutionary psychology  is that the presence of venomous spiders led to the evolution of a fear of spiders  or made acquisition of a fear of spiders especially easy  like all traits  there is variability in the intensity of fear of spiders  and those with more intense fears are classified as phobic  being relatively small  spiders do not fit the usual criterion for a threat in the animal kingdom where size is a factor  but they can have medically significant venom  however  a phobia is an irrational fear as opposed to a rational fear 

by ensuring that their surroundings were free from spiders  arachnophobes would have had a reduced risk of being bitten in ancestral environments  giving them a slight advantage over non arachnophobes in terms of survival  however  having a disproportionate fear of spiders in comparison to other  potentially dangerous creatures present during  homo sapiens   environment of evolutionary adaptiveness may have had drawbacks 

a      study found that people could detect images of spiders among images of flowers and mushrooms more quickly than they could detect images of flowers or mushrooms among images of spiders  the researchers suggested that this was because fast response to spiders was more relevant to human evolution 

the alternative view is that the dangers  such as from spiders  are overrated and not sufficient to influence evolution  instead  inheriting phobias would have restrictive and debilitating effects upon survival  rather than being an aid  for some communities such as in papua new guinea and cambodia spiders are included in traditional foods  this suggests arachnophobia may be a cultural  rather than genetic trait 

the fear of spiders can be treated by any of the general techniques suggested for specific phobias  the first line of treatment is systematic desensitization      also known as exposure therapy  before engaging in systematic desensitization  it is common to train the individual with arachnophobia in relaxation techniques  which will help keep the patient calm  systematic desensitization can be done in vivo  with live spiders  or by getting the individual to imagine situations involving spiders  then modelling interaction with spiders for the person affected and eventually interacting with real spiders  this technique can be effective in just one session 

recent advances in technology have enabled the use of virtual or augmented reality spiders for use in therapy  these techniques have proven to be effective

alabaster is a mineral or rock that is soft  often used for carving  and is processed for plaster powder  archaeologists and the stone processing industry use the word differently from geologists  the former use is in a wider sense that includes varieties of two different minerals  the fine grained massive type of gypsum and the fine grained banded type of calcite  geologists define alabaster only as the gypsum type  chemically  gypsum is a hydrous sulfate of calcium  while calcite is a carbonate of calcium  

both types of alabaster have similar properties  they are usually lightly colored  translucent  and soft stones  they have been used throughout history primarily for carving decorative artifacts 

the calcite type is also denominated  onyx marble    egyptian alabaster   and  oriental alabaster  and is geologically described as either a compact banded travertine or  a stalagmitic limestone marked with patterns of swirling bands of cream and brown    onyx marble  is a traditional  but geologically inaccurate  name because both onyx and marble have geological definitions that are distinct from even the broadest definition of  alabaster  
in general  ancient alabaster is calcite in the wider middle east  including egypt and mesopotamia  while it is gypsum in medieval europe  modern alabaster is probably calcite but may be either  both are easy to work and slightly soluble in water  they have been used for making a variety of indoor artwork and carving  and they will not survive long outdoors 

the two kinds are readily distinguished by their different hardnesses  gypsum alabaster is so soft that a fingernail scratches it  mohs hardness     to     while calcite cannot be scratched in this way  mohs hardness     although it yields to a knife  moreover  calcite alabaster  being a carbonate  effervesces when treated with hydrochloric acid  while gypsum alabaster remains almost unaffected when thus treated 

the origin of  alabaster  is in middle english through old french   alabastre    in turn derived from latin   alabaster    and that from greek                              alabastros    or                            alabastos     the greek words denoted a vase of alabaster 

the name may be derived further from ancient egyptian   a labaste    which refers to vessels of the egyptian goddess bast  she was represented as a lioness and frequently depicted as such in figures placed atop these alabaster vessels  other suggestions include derivation from the name of the ancient town of alabastron  egypt  described in sometimes contradictory manner by ancient roman authors  e  g  pliny the elder in  on stones  and ptolemy in  geography    the location of which is unknown 

the purest alabaster is a snow white material of fine uniform grain  but it often is associated with an oxide of iron  which produces brown clouding and veining in the stone  the coarser varieties of gypsum alabaster are converted by calcination into plaster of paris  and are sometimes known as  plaster stone  

the softness of alabaster enables it to be carved readily into elaborate forms  but its solubility in water renders it unsuitable for outdoor work  if alabaster with a smooth  polished surface is washed with dishwashing liquid  it will become rough  dull and whiter  losing most of its translucency and lustre  the finer kinds of alabaster are employed largely as an ornamental stone  especially for ecclesiastical decoration and for the rails of staircases and halls 

alabaster is mined and then sold in blocks to alabaster workshops  there they are cut to the needed size   squaring    and then are processed in different techniques  turned on a lathe for round shapes  carved into three dimensional sculptures  chiselled to produce low relief figures or decoration  and then given an elaborate finish that reveals its transparency  colour  and texture 

in order to diminish the translucency of the alabaster and to produce an opacity suggestive of true marble  the statues are immersed in a bath of water and heated gradually   nearly to the boiling point   an operation requiring great care  because if the temperature is not regulated carefully  the stone acquires a dead white  chalky appearance  the effect of heating appears to be a partial dehydration of the gypsum  if properly treated  it very closely resembles true marble and is known as  marmo di castellina  

alabaster is a porous stone and can be  dyed  into any colour or shade  a technique used for centuries  for this the stone needs to be fully immersed in various pigmentary solutions and heated to a specific temperature  the technique can be used to disguise alabaster  in this way a very misleading imitation of coral that is called  alabaster coral  is produced 

typically only one type is sculpted in any particular cultural environment  but sometimes both have been worked to make similar pieces in the same place and time  this was the case with small flasks of the alabastron type made in cyprus from the bronze age into the classical period 

when cut in thin sheets  alabaster is translucent enough to be used for small windows  it was used for this purpose in byzantine churches and later in medieval ones  especially in italy  large sheets of aragonese gypsum alabaster are used extensively in the contemporary cathedral of our lady of the angels  which was dedicated in      by the los angeles  california archdiocese  the cathedral incorporates special cooling to prevent the panes from overheating and turning opaque  the ancients used the calcite type  while the modern los angeles cathedral is using gypsum alabaster 

calcite alabaster  harder than the gypsum variety  was the kind primarily used in ancient egypt and the wider middle east  but not assyrian palace reliefs   and is also used in modern times  it is found as either a stalagmitic deposit from the floor and walls of limestone caverns  or as a kind of travertine  similarly deposited in springs of calcareous water  its deposition in successive layers gives rise to the banded appearance that the marble often shows on cross section  from which its name is derived  onyx marble or alabaster onyx  or sometimes simply  and wrongly  as onyx 

egyptian alabaster has been worked extensively near suez and assiut 

this stone variety is the  alabaster  of the ancient egyptians and bible and is often termed  oriental alabaster   since the early examples came from the far east  the greek name  alabastrites  is said to be derived from the town of alabastron in egypt  where the stone was quarried  the locality probably owed its name to the mineral  the origin of the mineral name is obscure  though see above  

the  oriental  alabaster was highly esteemed for making small perfume bottles or ointment vases called alabastra  the vessel name has been suggested as a possible source of the mineral name  in egypt  craftsmen used alabaster for canopic jars and various other sacred and sepulchral objects  a sarcophagus discovered in the tomb of seti i near thebes is on display in sir john soane s museum  london  it is carved in a single block of translucent calcite alabaster from alabastron 

algerian onyx marble has been quarried largely in the province of oran 

in mexico  there are famous deposits of a delicate green variety at la pedrara  in the district of tecali  near puebla  onyx marble occurs also in the district of tehuac  n and at several localities in the us including california  arizona  utah  colorado and virginia 

gypsum alabaster is the softer of the two varieties  the other being calcite alabaster  it was used primarily in medieval europe  and is also used in modern times 

 mosul marble  is a kind of gypsum alabaster found in the north of modern iraq  which was used for the assyrian palace reliefs of the  th to  th centuries bc  these are the largest type of alabaster sculptures to have been regularly made  the relief is very low and the carving detailed  but large rooms were lined with continuous compositions on slabs around high  the  lion hunt of ashurbanipal  and military lachish reliefs  both  th century and in the british museum  are some of the best known 

gypsum alabaster was very widely used for small sculpture for indoor use in the ancient world  especially in ancient egypt and mesopotamia  fine detail could be obtained in a material with an attractive finish without iron or steel tools  alabaster was used for vessels dedicated for use in the cult of the deity bast in the culture of the ancient egyptians  and thousands of gypsum alabaster artifacts dating to the late  th millennium bc also have been found in tell brak  present day nagar   in syria 

in mesopotamia  gypsum alabaster was the typical material for figures of deities and devotees from temples  as in a figure believed to represent the deity  abu  dating to the first half of the  rd millennium bc in new york 

much of the world s alabaster extraction is performed in the centre of the ebro valley in aragon  spain  which has the world s largest known exploitable deposits 
according to a brochure published by the aragon government  alabaster has elsewhere either been depleted  or its extraction is so difficult that it has almost been abandoned or is carried out at a very high cost 
there are two separate sites in aragon  both are located in tertiary basins 
the most important site is the fuentes azaila area  in the tertiary ebro basin 
the other is the calatayud teruel basin  which divides the iberian range in two main sectors  nw and se  

the abundance of aragonese alabaster was crucial for its use in architecture  sculpture and decoration 
there is no record of likely use by pre roman cultures  so perhaps the first ones to use alabaster in aragon were the romans  who produced vessels from alabaster following the greek and egyptian models 
it seems that since the reconstruction of the roman wall in zaragoza in the  rd century ad with alabaster  the use of this material became common in building for centuries 
muslim saraqusta  today  zaragoza  was also called  medina albaida   the white city  due to the appearance of its alabaster walls and palaces  which stood out among gardens  groves and orchards by the ebro and huerva rivers 

the oldest remains in the aljafer  a palace  together with other interesting elements like capitals  reliefs and inscriptions  were made using alabaster  but it was during the artistic and economic blossoming of the renaissance that aragonese alabaster reached its golden age 
in the   th century sculptors in aragon chose alabaster for their best works  they were adept at exploiting its lighting qualities and generally speaking the finished art pieces retained their natural color 

in europe  the centre of the alabaster trade today is florence  italy  tuscan alabaster occurs in nodular masses embedded in limestone  interstratified with marls of miocene and pliocene age  the mineral is worked largely by means of underground galleries  in the district of volterra  several varieties are recognized   veined  spotted  clouded  agatiform  and others  the finest kind  obtained principally from castellina  is sent to florence for figure sculpture  while the common kinds are carved locally  into vases  lights  and various ornamental objects  these items are objects of extensive trade  especially in florence  pisa  and livorno 

in the  rd century bc the etruscans used the alabaster of tuscany from the area of modern day volterra to produce funeral urns  possibly taught by greek artists  during the middle ages the craft of alabaster was almost completely forgotten  a revival started in the mid   th century  and until the beginning of the   th century alabaster work was strictly artistic and did not expand to form a large industry 

in the   th and   th centuries production of artistic  high quality renaissance style artifacts stopped altogether  being replaced by less sophisticated  cheaper items better suited for large scale production and commerce  the new industry prospered  but the reduced need of skilled craftsmen left only few still working  the   th century brought a boom to the industry  largely due to the  traveling artisans  who went and offered their wares to the palaces of europe  as well as to america and the east 

in the   th century new processing technology was also introduced  allowing for the production of custom made  unique pieces  as well as the combination of alabaster with other materials  apart from the newly developed craft  artistic work became again possible  chiefly by volterran sculptor albino funaioli  after a short slump  the industry was revived again by the sale of mass produced mannerist expressionist sculptures  and was further enhanced in the     s by a new branch creating ceiling and wall lamps in the art deco style and culminating in the participation at the      international exposition of modern industrial and decorative arts from paris  important names from the evolution of alabaster use after world war ii are volterran umberto borgna  the  first alabaster designer   and later on the architect and industrial designer angelo mangiarotti 

gypsum alabaster is a common mineral  which occurs in england in the keuper marls of the midlands  especially at chellaston in derbyshire  at fauld in staffordshire  and near newark in nottinghamshire  deposits at all of these localities have been worked extensively 

in the   th and   th centuries its carving into small statues and sets of relief panels for altarpieces was a valuable local industry in nottingham  as well as a major english export  these were usually painted  or partly painted  it was also used for the effigies  often life size  on tomb monuments  as the typical recumbent position suited the material s lack of strength  and it was cheaper and easier to work than good marble  after the english reformation the making of altarpiece sets was discontinued  but funerary monument work in reliefs and statues continued 

besides examples of these carvings still in britain  especially at the nottingham castle museum  british museum  and victoria and albert museum   trade in mineral alabaster  rather than just the antiques trade  has scattered examples in the material that may be found as far afield as the mus  e de cluny  spain  and scandinavia 

alabaster also is found  although in smaller quantity  at watchet in somerset  near penarth in glamorganshire  and elsewhere  in cumbria it occurs largely in the new red rocks  but at a lower geological horizon  the alabaster of nottinghamshire and derbyshire is found in thick nodular beds or  floors  in spheroidal masses known as  balls  or  bowls  and in smaller lenticular masses termed  cakes   at chellaston  where the local alabaster is known as  patrick   it has been worked into ornaments under the name of  derbyshire spar    a term more properly applied to fluorspar 

 black alabaster  is a rare anhydrite form of the gypsum based mineral  this black form is found in only three veins in the world  one each in united states  italy  and china 

alabaster caverns state park  near freedom  oklahoma is home to a natural gypsum cave in which much of the gypsum is in the form of alabaster  there are several types of alabaster found at the site  including pink  white  and the rare black alabaster 


chronological list of examples 






ahab

ahab          was the seventh king of israel since jeroboam i  the son and successor of omri  and the husband of jezebel of sidon  according to the hebrew scriptures  the hebrew bible presents ahab as a wicked king  he is criticised for following the ways of his wife jezebel  killing his subject naboth  and leading the nation of israel into idolatry 

the existence of ahab is historically supported outside the bible  shalmaneser iii documented     bc that he defeated an alliance of a dozen kings in the battle of qarqar  one of these was ahab 

ahab became king of israel in the thirty eighth year of asa  king of judah  and reigned for twenty two years  according to   kings  william f  albright dated his reign to           bc  while e  r  thiele offered the dates           bc  most recently  michael d  coogan has dated ahab s reign to           bc 

omri  ahab s father and founder of the short lived omri dynasty  seems to have been a successful military leader  he is reported in the text of the moabite mesha stele to have  oppressed moab for many days   during ahab s reign  moab  which had been conquered by his father  remained tributary  ahab was allied by marriage with jehoshaphat  who was king of judah  only with aram damascus is he believed to have had strained relations 

ahab married jezebel  the daughter of the king of tyre    kings         tells the story of ahab and jezebel  and indicates that jezebel was a dominant influence on ahab and strove to spread idol worship of baal in israel  ahab lived in samaria  the royal capital established by omri  and built a temple and altar to baal there  he was succeeded by ahaziah and jehoram  who reigned over israel until jehu s revolt of     bc 
the battle of qarqar is mentioned in extra biblical records  and was perhaps at apamea  where shalmaneser iii of assyria fought a great confederation of princes from cilicia  northern syria  israel  ammon  and the tribes of the syrian desert      bc   including ahab the israelite   a ha ab bu sir  a la a a   and hadadezer   adad  idri   

ahab s contribution was estimated at       chariots and        men  in reality  however  the number of chariots in ahab s forces was probably closer to a number in the hundreds  based upon archaeological excavations of the area and the foundations of stables that have been found   if  however  the numbers are referring to allies it could possibly include forces from tyre  judah  edom  and moab  the assyrian king claimed a victory  but his immediate return and subsequent expeditions in     bc and     bc against a similar but unspecified coalition seem to show that he met with no lasting success  according to the tanakh  however  ahab with       troops had previously overthrown ben hadad and his thirty two kings  who had come to lay siege to samaria  and in the following year obtained a decisive victory over him at aphek  probably in the plain of sharon at antipatris    kings      a treaty was made whereby ben hadad restored the cities which his father had taken from ahab s father  and trading facilities between damascus and samaria were granted 

jezreel has been identified as ahab s fortified chariot and cavalry base 

in the biblical text  ahab has five important encounters with prophets 

three years later  war broke out east of the jordan river  and ahab with jehoshaphat of judah went to recover ramoth gilead from the arameans  during this battle  ahab disguised himself  but he was mortally wounded by an unaimed arrow    kings      the hebrew bible says that dogs licked his blood  according to the prophecy of elijah  but the septuagint  the greek translation of the old testament  adds that pigs also licked his blood  symbolically making him unclean to the israelites  who abstained from pork  ahab was succeeded by his sons  ahaziah and jehoram 

jezebel s death  however  was more dramatic than ahab s  as recorded in   kings          jezebel was confronted by jehu who had her servants throw her out the window  causing her death 

  kings       through       contains the story of ahab s reign  this reign is one which faces opposition from several prophets of yahweh throughout as well as various consequences because of his marriage to jezebel  because of his worship of baal  disobedience to prophetic warnings and words  and also because of the murder of naboth  the murder of naboth  see jezebel   an act of royal encroachment  stirred up popular resentment just as the new cult aroused the opposition of the israelite prophets  including elijah and micaiah  indeed  he is referred to  for this and other things  as being  more evil than all the kings before him     kings         the followers of yahweh found their champion in elijah  his denunciation of the royal dynasty of israel and his emphatic insistence on the worship of yahweh and yahweh alone  illustrated by the contest between yahweh and baal on mount carmel    kings      form the keynote to a period which culminated in the accession of jehu  an event in which elijah s chosen disciple elisha was the leading figure

dasyproctidae

dasyproctidae is a family of large south american rodents  comprising the agoutis and acouchis  their fur is a reddish or dark colour above  with a paler underside  they are herbivorous  often feeding on ripe fruit that falls from trees  they live in burrows  and  like squirrels  will bury some of their food for later use 

dasyproctids exist in central and south america  which are the tropical parts of the new world  the fossil record of this family can be traced back to the late oligocene  deseadan in the salma classification  

as with all rodents  members of this family have incisors  pre molars  and molars  but no canines  the cheek teeth are hypsodont and flat crowned 

fossil taxa follow mckenna and bell  with modifications following kramarz 


the pacas  genus  cuniculus   are placed by some authorities in dasyproctidae  but molecular studies have demonstrated they do not form a monophyletic group 





algol

algol     designated beta persei      persei  abbreviated beta  per      per   known colloquially as the demon star  is a bright multiple star in the constellation of perseus and one of the first non nova variable stars to be discovered 

algol is a three star system  consisting of beta persei  aa   aa   and  ab   in which the hot luminous primary    persei  aa  and the larger  but cooler and fainter     persei  aa  regularly pass in front of each other causing eclipses  thus algol s magnitude is usually near constant at       but regularly dips to     every      days during the roughly    hour long partial eclipses  the secondary eclipse when the brighter primary star occults the fainter secondary is very shallow and can only be detected photoelectrically 

algol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable  known as algol variables 

an ancient egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days composed some       years ago is claimed to be the oldest historical document of the discovery of algol 
the association of algol with a demon like creature  gorgon in the greek tradition  ghoul in the arabic tradition  suggests that its variability was known long before the   th century  but except for the ancient egyptian discovery there is still no indisputable evidence for this  the arabic astronomer al sufi said nothing about any variability of the star in his  book of fixed stars  published c     

the variability of algol was noted in      by italian astronomer geminiano montanari  but the periodic nature of its variations in brightness was not recognized until more than a century later  when the british amateur astronomer john goodricke also proposed a mechanism for the star s variability  in may       he presented his findings to the royal society  suggesting that the periodic variability was caused by a dark body passing in front of the star  or else that the star itself has a darker region that is periodically turned toward the earth   for his report he was awarded the copley medal 

in       the harvard astronomer edward charles pickering presented evidence that algol was actually an eclipsing binary  this was confirmed a few years later  in       when the potsdam astronomer hermann carl vogel found periodic doppler shifts in the spectrum of algol  inferring variations in the radial velocity of this binary system  thus algol became one of the first known spectroscopic binaries  joel stebbins at the university of illinois observatory used an early selenium cell photometer to produce the first ever photoelectric study of a variable star  the light curve revealed the second minimum and the reflection effect between the two stars 
some difficulties in explaining the observed spectroscopic features led to the conjecture that a third star may be present in the system  four decades later this conjecture was found to be correct 

listed are the first eclipse dates and times of each month  all times in ut  
   persei aa  eclipses    persei aa  every          days    days    hours    min   therefore keep adding that much to each date and time to get the following eclipses  for example  the jan      h  eclipse will yield consecutive eclipse times on jan      h  then jan      h  then jan       h  etc  all times approximate  

algol is a triple star system  from the point of view of the earth  algol  aa  and algol  aa  form an eclipsing binary because their orbital plane contains the line of sight to the earth  the eclipsing binary pair is separated by only        astronomical units  au  from each other  whereas the third star in the system  algol  ab  is at an average distance of       au from the pair  and the mutual orbital period of the trio is      earth days  the total mass of the system is about     solar masses  and the mass ratios of aa   aa   and ab are about     to   to   

the three components of the bright triple star used to be  and still sometimes are  referred to as    per a  b  and c  the washington double star catalog lists them as aa   aa   and ab  with two very faint stars b and c about one arcmin distant  a further five faint stars are also listed as companions 

studies of algol led to the algol paradox in the theory of stellar evolution  although components of a binary star form at the same time  and massive stars evolve much faster than the less massive stars  the more massive component algol  a is still in the main sequence  but the less massive algol  b is a subgiant star at a later evolutionary stage  the paradox can be solved by mass transfer  when the more massive star became a subgiant  it filled its roche lobe  and most of the mass was transferred to the other star  which is still in the main sequence  in some binaries similar to algol  a gas flow can be seen 

this system also exhibits x ray and radio wave flares  the x ray flares are thought to be caused by the magnetic fields of the a and b components interacting with the mass transfer  the radio wave flares might be created by magnetic cycles similar to those of sunspots  but because the magnetic fields of these stars are up to ten times stronger than the field of the sun  these radio flares are more powerful and more persistent 

magnetic activity cycles in the chromospherically active secondary component induce changes in its radius of gyration that have been linked to recurrent orbital period variations on the order of           via the applegate mechanism  mass transfer between the components is small in the algol system but could be a significant source of period change in other algol type binaries 

algol is about       light years from the sun  but about      million years ago it passed within      light years of the solar system and its apparent magnitude was about         which is considerably brighter than the star sirius is today  because the total mass of the algol system is about      solar masses  at the closest approach this might have given enough gravity to perturb the oort cloud of the solar system somewhat and hence increase the number of comets entering the inner solar system  however  the actual increase in net cometary collisions is thought to have been quite small 

 beta persei  is the star s bayer designation  the name  algol  derives from arabic  ra  s al gh  l    head   ra  s   of the ogre   al gh  l    see  ghoul    the english name   demon star   is a direct translation of this  in       the international astronomical union organized a working group on star names  wgsn  to catalog and standardize proper names for stars  the wgsn s first bulletin of july      included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the wgsn  which included  algol  for this star  it is so entered on the iau catalog of star names 

in hebrew folklore  algol was called  r  sh ha s       n  or  satan s head   as stated by edmund chilmead  who called it  divels head  or  rosch hassatan   a latin name for algol from the   th century was  caput larvae  or  the spectre s head   hipparchus and pliny made this a separate  though connected  constellation 

in chinese      meaning  mausoleum   refers to an asterism consisting of    persei    persei     persei     persei     persei     persei     persei and    persei  consequently     persei itself is known as    english  the fifth star of mausoleum    according to r h  allen the star bore the grim name of  tseih she      meaning  piled up corpses  but this appears to be a misidentification  and  di   sh    is correctly    persei  which is inside the mausoleum 

historically  the star has received a strong association with bloody violence across a wide variety of cultures  in the  tetrabiblos   the  nd century astrological text of the alexandrian astronomer ptolemy  algol is referred to as  the gorgon of perseus  and associated with death by decapitation  a theme which mirrors the myth of the hero perseus s victory over the snake haired gorgon medusa  astrologically  algol is considered one of the unluckiest stars in the sky  and was listed as one of the    behenian stars 





amazing grace

 amazing grace  is a christian hymn published in       with words written by the english poet and anglican clergyman john newton               

newton wrote the words from personal experience  he grew up without any particular religious conviction  but his life s path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by others  reactions to what they took as his recalcitrant insubordination  he was pressed  conscripted  into service in the royal navy  and after leaving the service  he became involved in the atlantic slave trade  in       a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of county donegal  ireland  so severely that he called out to god for mercy  a moment that marked his spiritual conversion  he continued his slave trading career until      or       when he ended his seafaring altogether and began studying christian theology 

ordained in the church of england in       newton became curate of olney  buckinghamshire  where he began to write hymns with poet william cowper   amazing grace  was written to illustrate a sermon on new year s day of       it is unknown if there was any music accompanying the verses  it may have simply been chanted by the congregation  it debuted in print in      in newton and cowper s  olney hymns  but settled into relative obscurity in england  in the united states  however   amazing grace  was used extensively during the second great awakening in the early   th century  it has been associated with more than    melodies  but in      it was joined to a tune named  new britain  to which it is most frequently sung today  

with the message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of sins committed and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of god   amazing grace  is one of the most recognisable songs in the english speaking world  author gilbert chase writes that it is  without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns   and jonathan aitken  a newton biographer  estimates that it is performed about     million times annually  it has had particular influence in folk music  and has become an emblematic african american spiritual  its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music   amazing grace  saw a resurgence in popularity in the u s  during the     s and has been recorded thousands of times during and since the   th century  occasionally appearing on popular music charts 

according to the  dictionary of american hymnology   amazing grace  is john newton s spiritual autobiography in verse 

in       newton was born in wapping  a district in london near the thames  his father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a catholic but had protestant sympathies  and his mother was a devout independent unaffiliated with the anglican church  she had intended newton to become a clergyman  but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old  for the next few years  newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea  and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated  at the age of eleven  he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice  his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience 

as a youth  newton began a pattern of coming very close to death  examining his relationship with god  then relapsing into bad habits  as a sailor  he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed  characteristics of men  manners  opinions  times   a book by the third earl of shaftesbury  with him  in a series of letters he later wrote   like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm  i renounced the hopes and comforts of the gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me   his disobedience caused him to be pressed into the royal navy  and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit mary  polly  catlett  a family friend with whom he had fallen in love  after enduring humiliation for deserting  he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading 

newton often openly mocked the captain by creating obscene poems and songs about him that became so popular the crew began to join in  he entered into disagreements with several colleagues that resulted in his being starved almost to death  imprisoned while at sea and chained like the slaves they carried  then outright enslaved and forced to work on a plantation in sierra leone near the sherbro river  after several months he came to think of sierra leone as his home  but his father intervened after newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances  and a ship found him by coincidence  newton claimed the only reason he left was because of polly 

while aboard the ship  greyhound   newton gained notoriety for being one of the most profane men the captain had ever met  in a culture where sailors commonly used oaths and swore  newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard  but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery  in march       while the  greyhound  was in the north atlantic  a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where newton had been moments before  after hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized  newton and another mate tied themselves to the ship s pump to keep from being washed overboard  working for several hours  after proposing the measure to the captain  newton had turned and said   if this will not do  then lord have mercy upon us   newton rested briefly before returning to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours  during his time at the wheel he pondered his divine challenge 

about two weeks later  the battered ship and starving crew landed in lough swilly  ireland  for several weeks before the storm  newton had been reading  the christian s pattern   a summary of the   th century  the imitation of christ  by thomas    kempis  the memory of his own  lord have mercy upon us   uttered during a moment of desperation in the storm did not leave him  he began to ask if he was worthy of god s mercy or in any way redeemable as he had not only neglected his faith but directly opposed it  mocking others who showed theirs  deriding and denouncing god as a myth  he came to believe that god had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him 

newton s conversion was not immediate  but he contacted polly s family and announced his intentions to marry her  her parents were hesitant as he was known to be unreliable and impetuous  they knew he was profane  but they allowed him to write to polly  and he set to begin to submit to authority for her sake  he sought a place on a slave ship bound for africa  and newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before  the only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity  after a severe illness his resolve was renewed  yet he retained the same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries  newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed up rivers in africa now as a captain procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports  and subsequently transported them to north america  in between voyages  he married polly in      and he found it more difficult to leave her at the beginning of each trip  after three shipping experiences in the slave trade  newton was promised a position as ship s captain with cargo unrelated to slavery when  at the age of thirty  he collapsed and never sailed again 

working as a customs agent in liverpool starting in       newton began to teach himself latin  greek  and theology  he and polly immersed themselves in the church community  and newton s passion was so impressive that his friends suggested he become a priest in the church of england  he was turned down by john gilbert  archbishop of york  in       ostensibly for having no university degree  although the more likely reasons were his leanings toward evangelism and tendency to socialise with methodists  newton continued his devotions  and after being encouraged by a friend  he wrote about his experiences in the slave trade and his conversion  william legge   nd earl of dartmouth  impressed with his story  sponsored newton for ordination by john green  bishop of lincoln  and offered him the curacy of olney  buckinghamshire  in      

olney was a village of about       residents whose main industry was making lace by hand  the people were mostly illiterate and many of them were poor  newton s preaching was unique in that he shared many of his own experiences from the pulpit  many clergy preached from a distance  not admitting any intimacy with temptation or sin  he was involved in his parishioners  lives and was much loved  although his writing and delivery were sometimes unpolished  but his devotion and conviction were apparent and forceful  and he often said his mission was to  break a hard heart and to heal a broken heart   he struck a friendship with william cowper  a gifted writer who had failed at a career in law and suffered bouts of insanity  attempting suicide several times  cowper enjoyed olney and newton s company  he was also new to olney and had gone through a spiritual conversion similar to newton s  together  their effect on the local congregation was impressive  in       they found it necessary to start a weekly prayer meeting to meet the needs of an increasing number of parishioners  they also began writing lessons for children 

partly from cowper s literary influence  and partly because learned vicars were expected to write verses  newton began to try his hand at hymns  which had become popular through the language  made plain for common people to understand  several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the   th century  including isaac watts whose hymns newton had grown up hearing and charles wesley  with whom newton was familiar  wesley s brother john  the eventual founder of the methodist church  had encouraged newton to go into the clergy  watts was a pioneer in english hymn writing  basing his work after the psalms  the most prevalent hymns by watts and others were written in the common meter in          the first line is eight syllables and the second is six 

newton and cowper attempted to present a poem or hymn for each prayer meeting  the lyrics to  amazing grace  were written in late      and probably used in a prayer meeting for the first time on january          a collection of the poems newton and cowper had written for use in services at olney was bound and published anonymously in      under the title  olney hymns   newton contributed     of the     texts in  olney hymns      chronicles             faith s review and expectation  was the title of the poem with the first line  amazing grace   how sweet the sound   

the general impact of  olney hymns  was immediate and it became a widely popular tool for evangelicals in britain for many years  scholars appreciated cowper s poetry somewhat more than newton s plaintive and plain language driven from his forceful personality  the most prevalent themes in the verses written by newton in  olney hymns  are faith in salvation  wonder at god s grace  his love for jesus  and his cheerful exclamations of the joy he found in his faith  as a reflection of newton s connection to his parishioners  he wrote many of the hymns in first person  admitting his own experience with sin  bruce hindmarsh in  sing them over again to me  hymns and hymnbooks in america  considers  amazing grace  an excellent example of newton s testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective  several of newton s hymns were recognized as great work   amazing grace  was not among them  while others seem to have been included to fill in when cowper was unable to write  jonathan aitken calls newton  specifically referring to  amazing grace   an  unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation   noting that only twenty one of the nearly     words used in all six verses have more than one syllable 

william phipps in the  anglican theological review  and author james basker have interpreted the first stanza of  amazing grace  as evidence of newton s realization that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness  perhaps representing a wider common understanding of newton s motivations  newton joined forces with a young man named william wilberforce  the british member of parliament who led the parliamentarian campaign to abolish the slave trade in the british empire  culminating in the slave trade act       however  newton became an ardent and outspoken abolitionist after he left olney in the     s  he never connected the construction of the hymn that became  amazing grace  to anti slavery sentiments  the lyrics in  olney hymns  were arranged by their association to the biblical verses that would be used by newton and cowper in their prayer meetings and did not address any political objective  for newton  the beginning of the year was a time to reflect on one s spiritual progress  at the same time he completed a diary which has since been lost that he had begun    years before  two years after he quit sailing  the last entry of      was a recounting of how much he had changed since then 

the title ascribed to the hymn     chronicles              refers to david s reaction to the prophet nathan telling him that god intends to maintain his family line forever  some christians interpret this as a prediction that jesus christ  as a descendant of david  was promised by god as the salvation for all people  newton s sermon on that january day in      focused on the necessity to express one s gratefulness for god s guidance  that god is involved in the daily lives of christians though they may not be aware of it  and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await  newton saw himself a sinner like david who had been chosen  perhaps undeservedly  and was humbled by it  according to newton  unconverted sinners were  blinded by the god of this world  until  mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired      our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace  

the new testament served as the basis for many of the lyrics of  amazing grace   the first verse  for example  can be traced to the story of the prodigal son  in the gospel of luke the father says   for this son of mine was dead and is alive again  he was lost  and is found   the story of jesus healing a blind man who tells the pharisees that he can now see is told in the gospel of john  newton used the words  i was blind but now i see  and declared  oh to grace how great a debtor   in his letters and diary entries as early as       the effect of the lyrical arrangement  according to bruce hindmarsh  allows an instant release of energy in the exclamation  amazing grace    to be followed by a qualifying reply in  how sweet the sound   in  an annotated anthology of hymns   newton s use of an exclamation at the beginning of his verse is called  crude but effective  in an overall composition that  suggest s  a forceful  if simple  statement of faith   grace is recalled three times in the following verse  culminating in newton s most personal story of his conversion  underscoring the use of his personal testimony with his parishioners 

the sermon preached by newton was his last  of those that william cowper heard in olney  since cowper s mental instability returned shortly thereafter  steve turner  author of  amazing grace  the story of america s most beloved song   suggests newton may have had his friend in mind  employing the themes of assurance and deliverance from despair for cowper s benefit 

although it had its roots in england   amazing grace  became an integral part of the christian tapestry in the united states  more than    of newton and cowper s hymns were republished in other british hymnals and magazines  but  amazing grace  was not  appearing only once in a      hymnal sponsored by the countess of huntingdon  scholar john julian commented in his       a dictionary of hymnology  that outside of the united states  the song was unknown and it was  far from being a good example of newton s finest work   between      and       four variations of newton s hymn were published in the u s  in baptist  dutch reformed  and congregationalist hymnodies  by      presbyterians and methodists also included newton s verses in their hymnals 

the greatest influences in the   th century that propelled  amazing grace  to spread across the u s  and become a staple of religious services in many denominations and regions were the second great awakening and the development of shape note singing communities  a tremendous religious movement swept the u s  in the early   th century  marked by the growth and popularity of churches and religious revivals that got their start in kentucky and tennessee  unprecedented gatherings of thousands of people attended camp meetings where they came to experience salvation  preaching was fiery and focused on saving the sinner from temptation and backsliding  religion was stripped of ornament and ceremony  and made as plain and simple as possible  sermons and songs often used repetition to get across to a rural population of poor and mostly uneducated people the necessity of turning away from sin  witnessing and testifying became an integral component to these meetings  where a congregation member or even a stranger would rise and recount his turn from a sinful life to one of piety and peace   amazing grace  was one of many hymns that punctuated fervent sermons  although the contemporary style used a refrain  borrowed from other hymns  that employed simplicity and repetition such as 

simultaneously  an unrelated movement of communal singing was established throughout the south and western states  a format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in       it used four sounds to symbolize the basic scale  fa sol la fa sol la mi fa  each sound was accompanied by a specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing  the method was simple to learn and teach  so schools were established throughout the south and west  communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space  one member directing the group as a whole  most of the music was christian  but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual  communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a calvinistic sense of simplicity  so the songs were sung a cappella 

when originally used in olney  it is unknown what music  if any  accompanied the verses written by john newton  contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry  the first known instance of newton s lines joined to music was in  a companion to the countess of huntingdon s hymns   london         where it is set to the tune  hephzibah  by english composer john husband  common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes  more than twenty musical settings of  amazing grace  circulated with varying popularity until      when william walker assigned newton s words to a traditional song named  new britain   which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies   gallaher  and  st  mary   first published in the  columbian harmony  by charles h  spilman and benjamin shaw  cincinnati         spilman and shaw  both students at kentucky s centre college  compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals  to satisfy  the wants of the church in her triumphal march   most of the tunes had been previously published  but  gallaher  and  st  mary  had not  as neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission  scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of british origin  a manuscript from      by lucius chapin  a famous hymn writer of that time  contains a tune very close to  st  mary   but that does not mean that he wrote it 

 amazing grace   with the words written by newton and joined with  new britain   the melody most currently associated with it  appeared for the first time in walker s shape note tunebook  southern harmony  in       it was  according to author steve turner  a  marriage made in heaven      the music behind  amazing  had a sense of awe to it  the music behind  grace  sounded graceful  there was a rise at the point of confession  as though the author was stepping out into the open and making a bold declaration  but a corresponding fall when admitting his blindness   walker s collection was enormously popular  selling about         copies all over the u s  when the total population was just over    million  another shape note tunebook named  the sacred harp         by georgia residents benjamin franklin white and elisha j  king became widely influential and continues to be used 

another verse was first recorded in harriet beecher stowe s immensely influential      anti slavery novel  uncle tom s cabin   three verses were emblematically sung by tom in his hour of deepest crisis  he sings the sixth and fifth verses in that order  and stowe included another verse not written by newton that had been passed down orally in african american communities for at least    years  it was originally one of between    and    verses of a song titled  jerusalem  my happy home  that first appeared in a      book called  a collection of sacred ballads  

 amazing grace  came to be an emblem of a christian movement and a symbol of the u s  itself as the country was involved in a great political experiment  attempting to employ democracy as a means of government  shape note singing communities  with all the members sitting around an open center  each song employing a different director  illustrated this in practice  simultaneously  the u s  began to expand westward into previously unexplored territory that was often wilderness  the  dangers  toils  and snares  of newton s lyrics had both literal and figurative meanings for americans  this became poignantly true during the most serious test of american cohesion in the u s  civil war                 amazing grace  set to  new britain  was included in two hymnals distributed to soldiers and with death so real and imminent  religious services in the military became commonplace  the hymn was translated into other languages as well  while on the trail of tears  the cherokee sang christian hymns as a way of coping with the ongoing tragedy  and a version of the song by samuel worcester that had been translated into the cherokee language became very popular 

although  amazing grace  set to  new britain  was popular  other versions existed regionally  primitive baptists in the appalachian region often used  new britain  with other hymns  and sometimes sing the words of  amazing grace  to other folk songs  including titles such as  in the pines    pisgah    primrose   and  evan   as all are able to be sung in common meter  of which the majority of their repertoire consists  a tune named  arlington  accompanied newton s verses as much as  new britain  for a time in the late   th century 

two musical arrangers named dwight moody and ira sankey heralded another religious revival in the cities of the u s  and europe  giving the song international exposure  moody s preaching and sankey s musical gifts were significant  their arrangements were the forerunners of gospel music  and churches all over the u s  were eager to acquire them  moody and sankey began publishing their compositions in       and  amazing grace  appeared three times with three different melodies  but they were the first to give it its title  hymns were typically published using the first line of the lyrics  or the name of the tune such as  new britain   a publisher named edwin othello excell gave the version of  amazing grace  set to  new britain  immense popularity by publishing it in a series of hymnals that were used in urban churches  excell altered some of walker s music  making it more contemporary and european  giving  new britain  some distance from its rural folk music origins  excell s version was more palatable for a growing urban middle class and arranged for larger church choirs  several editions featuring newton s first three stanzas and the verse previously included by harriet beecher stowe in  uncle tom s cabin  were published by excell between      and       and his version of  amazing grace  became the standard form of the song in american churches 

with the advent of recorded music and radio   amazing grace  began to cross over from primarily a gospel standard to secular audiences  the ability to record combined with the marketing of records to specific audiences allowed  amazing grace  to take on thousands of different forms in the   th century  where edwin othello excell sought to make the singing of  amazing grace  uniform throughout thousands of churches  records allowed artists to improvise with the words and music specific to each audience  allmusic lists more than       recordings including re releases and compilations as of september       its first recording is an a cappella version from      by the sacred harp choir  it was included from      to      in okeh records  catalogue  which typically concentrated strongly on blues and jazz  demand was high for black gospel recordings of the song by h  r  tomlin and j  m  gates  a poignant sense of nostalgia accompanied the recordings of several gospel and blues singers in the     s and     s who used the song to remember their grandparents  traditions  and family roots  it was recorded with musical accompaniment for the first time in      by fiddlin  john carson  although to another folk hymn named  at the cross   not to  new britain    amazing grace  is emblematic of several kinds of folk music styles  often used as the standard example to illustrate such musical techniques as lining out and call and response  that have been practiced in both black and white folk music 

mahalia jackson s      version received significant radio airplay  and as her popularity grew throughout the     s and     s  she often sang it at public events such as concerts at carnegie hall  author james basker states that the song has been employed by african americans as the  paradigmatic negro spiritual  because it expresses the joy felt at being delivered from slavery and worldly miseries  anthony heilbut  author of  the gospel sound   states that the  dangers  toils  and snares  of newton s words are a  universal testimony  of the african american experience  during the civil rights movement and opposition to the vietnam war  the song took on a political tone  mahalia jackson employed  amazing grace  for civil rights marchers  writing that she used it  to give magical protection a charm to ward off danger  an incantation to the angels of heaven to descend      i was not sure the magic worked outside the church walls      in the open air of mississippi  but i wasn t taking any chances   folk singer judy collins  who knew the song before she could remember learning it  witnessed fannie lou hamer leading marchers in mississippi in       singing  amazing grace   collins also considered it a talisman of sorts  and saw its equal emotional impact on the marchers  witnesses  and law enforcement who opposed the civil rights demonstrators  according to fellow folk singer joan baez  it was one of the most requested songs from her audiences  but she never realized its origin as a hymn  by the time she was singing it in the     s she said it had  developed a life of its own   it even made an appearance at the woodstock music festival in      during arlo guthrie s performance 

collins decided to record it in the late     s amid an atmosphere of counterculture introspection  she was part of an encounter group that ended a contentious meeting by singing  amazing grace  as it was the only song to which all the members knew the words  her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her      album  whales   nightingales   collins  who had a history of alcohol abuse  claimed that the song was able to  pull her through  to recovery  it was recorded in st  paul s  the chapel at columbia university  chosen for the acoustics  she chose an  a cappella  arrangement that was close to edwin othello excell s  accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers  collins connected it to the vietnam war  to which she objected   i didn t know what else to do about the war in vietnam  i had marched  i had voted  i had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates i believed in  the war was still raging  there was nothing left to do  i thought      but sing  amazing grace    gradually and unexpectedly  the song began to be played on the radio  and then be requested  it rose to number    on the  billboard  hot      remaining on the charts for    weeks  as if  she wrote  her fans had been  waiting to embrace it   in the uk  it charted   times between      and       peaking at number   and spending a total of    weeks on popular music charts  her rendition also reached number   in new zealand and number    in ireland in      

although collins used it as a catharsis for her opposition to the vietnam war  two years after her rendition  the royal scots dragoon guards  senior scottish regiment of the british army  recorded an instrumental version featuring a bagpipe soloist accompanied by a pipe and drum band  the tempo of their arrangement was slowed to allow for the bagpipes  but it was based on collins   it began with a bagpipe solo introduction similar to her lone voice  then it was accompanied by the band of bagpipes and horns  whereas in her version she is backed up by a chorus  it topped the  rpm  national singles chart in canada for three weeks  and rose as high as number    in the u s  it is also a controversial instrumental  as it combined pipes with a military band  the pipe major of the royal scots dragoon guards was summoned to edinburgh castle and chastised for demeaning the bagpipes 

aretha franklin and rod stewart also recorded  amazing grace  around the same time  and both of their renditions were popular  all four versions were marketed to distinct types of audiences thereby assuring its place as a pop song  johnny cash recorded it on his      album  sings precious memories   dedicating it to his older brother jack  who had been killed in a mill accident when they were boys in dyess  arkansas  cash and his family sang it to themselves while they worked in the cotton fields following jack s death  cash often included the song when he toured prisons  saying  for the three minutes that song is going on  everybody is free  it just frees the spirit and frees the person  

the u s  library of congress has a collection of       versions of and songs inspired by  amazing grace   some of which were first time recordings by folklorists alan and john lomax  a father and son team who in      traveled thousands of miles across the south to capture the different regional styles of the song  more contemporary renditions include samples from such popular artists as sam cooke and the soul stirrers         the byrds         elvis presley         skeeter davis         mighty clouds of joy         amazing rhythm aces         willie nelson         the lemonheads        and mnl          

following the appropriation of the hymn in secular music   amazing grace  became such an icon in american culture that it has been used for a variety of secular purposes and marketing campaigns  placing it in danger of becoming a clich    it has been mass produced on souvenirs  lent its name to a superman villain  appeared on  the simpsons  to demonstrate the redemption of a murderous character named sideshow bob  incorporated into hare krishna chants and adapted for wicca ceremonies  it can also be sung to the theme from  the mickey mouse club   as garrison keillor has observed  the hymn has been employed in several films  including  alice s restaurant    coal miner s daughter   and  silkwood   it is referenced in the      film  amazing grace   which highlights newton s influence on the leading british abolitionist william wilberforce  and in the upcoming film biography of newton   newton s grace   the      science fiction film    used  amazing grace  amid a context of christian symbolism  to memorialize mr  spock following his death  but more practically  because the song has become  instantly recognizable to many in the audience as music that sounds appropriate for a funeral  according to a  star trek  scholar  since       when an organ instrumental of  new britain  became a bestseller   amazing grace  has been associated with funerals and memorial services  it has become a song that inspires hope in the wake of tragedy  becoming a sort of  spiritual national anthem  according to authors mary rourke and emily gwathmey  for example  president barack obama recited and then sang the hymn at the memorial service for clementa pinckney  one of the victims of the      charleston church shooting 

in recent years  the words of the hymn have been changed in some religious publications to downplay a sense of imposed self loathing by its singers  the second line   that saved a wretch like me   has been rewritten as  that saved and strengthened me    save a soul like me   or  that saved and set me free   kathleen norris in her book  amazing grace  a vocabulary of faith  characterizes this transformation of the original words as  wretched english  making the line that replaces the original  laughably bland   part of the reason for this change has been the altered interpretations of what wretchedness and grace means  newton s calvinistic view of redemption and divine grace formed his perspective that he considered himself a sinner so vile that he was unable to change his life or be redeemed without god s help  yet his lyrical subtlety  in steve turner s opinion  leaves the hymn s meaning open to a variety of christian and non christian interpretations   wretch  also represents a period in newton s life when he saw himself outcast and miserable  as he was when he was enslaved in sierra leone  his own arrogance was matched by how far he had fallen in his life 

the communal understanding of redemption and human self worth has changed since newton s time  since the     s  self help books  psychology  and some modern expressions of christianity have viewed this disparity in terms of grace being an innate quality within all people who must be inspired or strong enough to find it  something to achieve  in contrast to newton s vision of wretchedness as his willful sin and distance from god  wretchedness has instead come to mean an obstacle of physical  social  or spiritual nature to overcome in order to achieve a state of grace  happiness  or contentment  since its immense popularity and iconic nature   grace  and the meaning behind the words of  amazing grace  have become as individual as the singer or listener  bruce hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of  amazing grace  is due to the absence of any mention of god in the lyrics until the fourth verse  by excell s version  the fourth verse begins  when we ve been there ten thousand years    and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of god   grace   however  to john newton had a clearer meaning  as he used the word to represent god or the power of god 

the transformative power of the song was investigated by journalist bill moyers in a documentary released in       moyers was inspired to focus on the song s power after watching a performance at lincoln center  where the audience consisted of christians and non christians  and he noticed that it had an equal impact on everybody in attendance  unifying them  james basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose  amazing grace  to represent a collection of anti slavery poetry   there is a transformative power that is applicable        the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace  of suffering into beauty  of alienation into empathy and connection  of the unspeakable into imaginative literature  

moyers interviewed collins  cash  opera singer jessye norman  appalachian folk musician jean ritchie and her family  white sacred harp singers in georgia  black sacred harp singers in alabama  and a prison choir at the texas state penitentiary at huntsville  collins  cash  and norman were unable to discern if the power of the song came from the music or the lyrics  norman  who once notably sang it at the end of a large outdoor rock concert for nelson mandela s   th birthday  stated   i don t know whether it s the text i don t know whether we re talking about the lyrics when we say that it touches so many people or whether it s that tune that everybody knows   a prisoner interviewed by moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse    twas grace that taught my heart to fear  and grace my fears relieved  by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realized he may never get his life in order  compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison  gospel singer marion williams summed up its effect   that s a song that gets to everybody  

the  dictionary of american hymnology  claims it is included in more than a thousand published hymnals  and recommends its use for  occasions of worship when we need to confess with joy that we are saved by god s grace alone  as a hymn of response to forgiveness of sin or as an assurance of pardon  as a confession of faith or after the sermon

the mass distribution of these disks was seen as wasteful by the public and led to protest groups  one such was no more aol cds  a web based effort by two it workers to collect one million disks with the intent to return the disks to aol  the website was started in august       and an estimated         cds were collected by august      when the project was shut down 


when aol gave clients access to usenet in       they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view   alt aol sucks   aol did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view  but changed the description to  flames and complaints about america online   with aol clients swarming usenet newsgroups  the old  existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both aol and its clients  referring to the new state of affairs as eternal september 

aol discontinued access to usenet on june           no official details were provided as to the cause of decommissioning usenet access  except providing users the suggestion to access usenet services from a third party  google groups  aol then provided community based message boards in lieu of usenet 

aol has a detailed set of guidelines and expectations for users on their service  known as the terms of service  tos  also known as conditions of service  or cos in the uk   it is separated into three different sections   member agreement    community guidelines  and  privacy policy   all three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the aol service  during the period when volunteer chat room hosts and board monitors were used  chat room hosts were given a brief online training session and test on terms of service violations 

there have been many complaints over rules that govern an aol user s conduct  some users disagree with the tos  citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the tos may change without users being made aware  a considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of user generated content during the earlier years of growth for aol 

in early       aol stated its intention to implement a certified email system called goodmail  which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have pre existing business relationships  with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without the risk that the email messages might be blocked or stripped by spam filters 

this decision drew fire from moveon  which characterized the program as an  email tax   and the eff  which characterized it as a shakedown of non profits  a website called dearaol com was launched  with an online petition and a blog that garnered hundreds of signatures from people and organizations expressing their opposition to aol s use of goodmail 

esther dyson defended the move in an editorial in  the new york times   saying  i hope goodmail succeeds  and that it has lots of competition  i also think it and its competitors will eventually transform into services that more directly serve the interests of mail recipients  instead of the fees going to goodmail and eon  they will also be shared with the individual recipients  

tim lee of the technology liberation front posted an article that questioned the eff s adopting a confrontational posture when dealing with private companies  lee s article cited a series of discussions on declan mccullagh s politechbot mailing list on this subject between the eff s danny o brien and antispammer suresh ramasubramanian  who has also compared the eff s tactics in opposing goodmail to tactics used by republican political strategist karl rove  spamassassin developer justin mason posted some criticism of the eff s and moveon s  going overboard  in their opposition to the scheme 

the dearaol com campaign lost momentum and disappeared  with the last post to the now defunct dearaol com blog    aol starts the shakedown  being made on may         

comcast  who also used the service  announced on its website that goodmail had ceased operations and as of february         they no longer used the service 

on august          aol released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing    million search keywords for over         users over a   month period between march         and may     intended for research purposes  aol pulled the file from public access by august    but not before its wide distribution on the internet by others  derivative research  titled  a picture of search  was published by authors pass  chowdhury and torgeson for the first international conference on scalable information systems 

the data were used by websites such as aolstalker for entertainment purposes  where users of aolstalker are encouraged to judge aol clients based on the humorousness of personal details revealed by search behavior 

in       jason smathers  an aol employee  was convicted of stealing america online s    million screen names and selling them to a known spammer  smathers pled guilty to conspiracy charges in       smathers pled guilty to violations of the us can spam act of       he was sentenced in august      to    months in prison  the sentencing judge also recommended smathers be forced to pay         in restitution  triple the         that he sold the addresses for 

on february          a class action lawsuit was filed against support com  inc  and partner aol  inc  the lawsuit alleged support com and aol s computer checkup  scareware   which uses software developed by support com  misrepresented that their software programs would identify and resolve a host of technical problems with computers  offered to perform a free    scan     which often found problems with users  computers  the companies then offered to sell software   for which aol allegedly charged       a month and support com       to remedy those problems  both aol  inc  and support com  inc  settled on may          for      million  this included        to each valid class member and          each to consumer watchdog and the electronic frontier foundation  judge jacqueline scott corley wrote     distributing a portion of the  funds  to consumer watchdog will meet the interests of the silent class members because the organization will use the funds to help protect consumers across the nation from being subject to the types of fraudulent and misleading conduct that is alleged here     and    eff   s mission includes a strong consumer protection component  especially in regards to online protection    

aol continues to market  computer checkup   it is not clear if this latest  computer checkup  continues to use scareware techniques 

following media reports about prism  nsa s massive electronic surveillance program  in june       several technology companies were identified as participants  including aol  according to leaks of said program  aol joined the prism program in      

at one time  most aol users had an online  profile  hosted by the aol hometown service  when aol hometown was discontinued  users had to create a new profile on bebo  this was an unsuccessful attempt to create a social network that would compete with facebook  when the value of bebo decreased to a tiny fraction of the      million aol paid for it  users were forced to recreate their profiles yet again  on a new service called aol lifestream 

aol took the decision to shut down lifestream on february           and gave users one month s notice to save off photos and videos that had been uploaded to lifestream  following the shutdown  aol no longer provides any option for hosting user profiles 

during the hometown bebo lifestream era  another user s profile could be displayed by clicking the  buddy info  button in the aol desktop software  after the shutdown of lifestream  clicking  buddy info  does something that provides no information whatsoever about the selected buddy  it causes the aim home page  www aim com  to be displayed 





anno domini

the terms  ad  and before christ  bc  are used to label or number years in the julian and gregorian calendars  the term    is medieval latin and means  in the year of the lord   but is often presented using  our lord  instead of  the lord   taken from the full original phrase   anno domini nostri jesu christi    which translates to   in the year of our lord jesus christ  

this calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of jesus of nazareth  with  ad  counting years from the start of this epoch  and  bc  denoting years before the start of the era  there is no year zero in this scheme  so the year ad    immediately follows the year    bc  this dating system was devised in     by dionysius exiguus of scythia minor  but was not widely used until after     

the gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today  for decades  it has been the unofficial global standard  adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication  transportation  and commercial integration  and recognized by international institutions such as the united nations 

traditionally  english followed latin usage by placing the  ad  abbreviation before the year number  however  bc is placed after the year number  for example  ad        but     bc   which also preserves syntactic order  the abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a century or millennium  as in  fourth century ad  or  second millennium ad   although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions   because bc is the english abbreviation for  before christ   it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that ad means  after death   i e   after the death of jesus  however  this would mean that the approximate    years commonly associated with the life of jesus would neither be included in the bc nor the ad time scales 

terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non christian people is to call this the current or common era  abbreviated as ce   with the preceding years referred to as before the common or current era  bce   astronomical year numbering and iso      avoid words or abbreviations related to christianity  but use the same numbers for ad years 

the  anno domini  dating system was devised in     by dionysius exiguus to enumerate the years in his easter table  his system was to replace the diocletian era that had been used in an old easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted christians  the last year of the old table  diocletian      was immediately followed by the first year of his table  ad      when he devised his table  julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year   he himself stated that the  present year  was  the consulship of probus junior   which was     years  since the incarnation of our lord jesus christ   thus dionysius implied that jesus  incarnation occurred     years earlier  without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred   however  nowhere in his exposition of his table does dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system  whether consulate  olympiad  year of the world  or regnal year of augustus  much less does he explain or justify the underlying date  

bonnie j  blackburn and leofranc holford strevens briefly present arguments for   bc    bc  or ad   as the year dionysius intended for the nativity or incarnation  among the sources of confusion are 

it is not known how dionysius established the year of jesus s birth  two major theories are that dionysius based his calculation on the gospel of luke  which states that jesus was  about thirty years old  shortly after  the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar   and hence subtracted thirty years from that date  or that dionysius counted back     years from the first year of his new table 
it has also been speculated by georges declercq that dionysius  desire to replace diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world  at the time  it was believed by some that the resurrection of the dead and end of the world would occur     years after the birth of jesus  the old  anno mundi  calendar theoretically commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the old testament  it was believed that  based on the  anno mundi  calendar  jesus was born in the year       or      years after the world was created  with the year      of the  anno mundi  calendar marking the end of the world   anno mundi        approximately ad      was thus equated with the resurrection and the end of the world but this date had already passed in the time of dionysius 

the anglo saxon historian the venerable bede  who was familiar with the work of dionysius exiguus  used  anno domini  dating in his  ecclesiastical history of the english people   completed in      in this same history  he also used another latin term   ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo    in fact in the   th year before the time of the lord s incarnation    equivalent to the english  before christ   to identify years before the first year of this era  both dionysius and bede regarded  anno domini  as beginning at the incarnation of jesus  but  the distinction between incarnation and nativity was not drawn until the late  th century  when in some places the incarnation epoch was identified with christ s conception  i e   the annunciation on march       annunciation style   
on the continent of europe   anno domini  was introduced as the era of choice of the carolingian renaissance by the english cleric and scholar alcuin in the late eighth century  its endorsement by emperor charlemagne and his successors popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the carolingian empire ultimately lies at the core of the system s prevalence  according to the catholic encyclopedia  popes continued to date documents according to regnal years for some time  but usage of ad gradually became more common in roman catholic countries from the   th to the   th centuries  in       portugal became the last western european country to switch to the system begun by dionysius  eastern orthodox countries only began to adopt ad instead of the byzantine calendar in      when russia did so  with others adopting it in the   th and   th centuries 

although  anno domini  was in widespread use by the  th century  the term  before christ   or its equivalent  did not become common until much later  bede used the expression   anno igitur ante incarnationem dominicam    so in the year before the incarnation of the lord  twice    anno an xpi nativitate    in the year before the birth of christ  is found in      in a work by a german monk  in       the french jesuit theologian denis p  tau  dionysius petavius in latin   with his work  de doctrina temporum   popularized the usage  ante christum   latin for  before christ   to mark years prior to ad 

when the reckoning from jesus  incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western europe  various people chose different christian feast days to begin the year  christmas  annunciation  or easter  thus  depending on the time and place  the year number changed on different days in the year  which created slightly different styles in chronology 
with these various styles  the same day could  in some cases  be dated in            or      

the date of birth of jesus of nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text  but most scholars assume a date of birth between   bc and   bc  the historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating  but the date is estimated through two different approaches     one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the nativity accounts in the gospels of luke and matthew  and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the ministry of jesus 

during the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the christian era  european countries used various systems to count years  systems in use included consular dating  imperial regnal year dating  and creation dating 

although the last non imperial consul  basilius  was appointed in     by emperor justinian i  later emperors through constans ii             were appointed consuls on the first   january after their accession  all of these emperors  except justinian  used imperial post consular years for the years of their reign  along with their regnal years  long unused  this practice was not formally abolished until novell xciv of the law code of leo vi did so in     

another calculation had been developed by the alexandrian monk annianus around the year ad      placing the annunciation on    march ad    julian    eight to ten years after the date that dionysius was to imply  although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the byzantine empire  years numbered from it  an  era of incarnation   were exclusively used and are yet used  in ethiopia  this accounts for the seven  or eight year discrepancy between the gregorian and ethiopian calendars  byzantine chroniclers like maximus the confessor  george syncellus  and theophanes dated their years from annianus  creation of the world  this era  called  anno mundi    year of the world   abbreviated am   by modern scholars  began its first year on    march      bc  later byzantine chroniclers used  anno mundi  years from   september      bc  the byzantine era  no single  anno mundi  epoch was dominant throughout the christian world  eusebius of caesarea in his  chronicle  used an era beginning with the birth of abraham  dated in      bc  ad          anno abrahami  

spain and portugal continued to date by the era of the caesars or spanish era  which began counting from    bc  well into the middle ages  in       portugal became the last catholic country to adopt the  anno domini  system 

the era of martyrs  which numbered years from the accession of diocletian in      who launched the last yet most severe persecution of christians  was used by the church of alexandria and is still used  officially  by the coptic orthodox and coptic catholic churches  it was also used by the ethiopian church  another system was to date from the crucifixion of jesus  which as early as hippolytus and tertullian was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the gemini  ad      which appears in some medieval manuscripts 

alternative names for the  anno domini  era include  vulgaris aerae   found      in latin  
 vulgar era   in english  as early as       
 christian era   in english  in       
 common era   in english        
and  current era  
since       the alternative abbreviations ce and bce   sometimes written c e  and b c e   are sometimes used in place of ad and bc 

the  common current era    ce   terminology is often preferred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly make religious references 
for example  cunningham and starr        write that  b c e  c e     do not presuppose faith in christ and hence are more appropriate for interfaith dialog than the conventional b c  a d   upon its foundation  the republic of china adopted the minguo era  but used the western calendar for international purposes  the translated term was          x   yu  n    western era    later  in       the people s republic of china adopted          g  ngyu  n    common era   for all purposes domestic and foreign 

in the ad year numbering system  whether applied to the julian or gregorian calendars  ad   is preceded by   bc  there is no year     between them  so a new century begins in a year which has      as the final digits  e g                      new millennia likewise are considered to have begun in      and       this is at odds with the common conception that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes                    etc    for example  the worldwide celebration of the new millennium took place on new year s eve       when the year number ticked over to      

for computational reasons  astronomical year numbering and the iso      standard designate years so that ad     year      bc   year      bc   year       etc  in common usage  ancient dates are expressed in the julian calendar  but iso      uses the gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application  thus dates using the year   or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to bc or ad

alcuin

alcuin of york                 may     ad    also called ealhwine  alhwin or alchoin   was an english scholar  clergyman  poet and teacher from york  northumbria  he was born around     and became the student of archbishop ecgbert at york  at the invitation of charlemagne  he became a leading scholar and teacher at the carolingian court  where he remained a figure in the    s and    s 

alcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises  as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems  he was made abbot of tours in      where he remained until his death   the most learned man anywhere to be found   according to einhard s  life of charlemagne    ca             he is considered among the most important architects of the carolingian renaissance  among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the carolingian era 

alcuin was born in northumbria  presumably sometime in the    s  virtually nothing is known of his parents  family background  or origin  in common hagiographical fashion  the  vita alcuini  asserts that alcuin was  of noble english stock   and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars  alcuin s own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as wilgils  father of the missionary saint willibrord  and beornred  abbot of echternach and bishop of sens  who was more distantly related 

in his  life  of st willibrord  alcuin writes that wilgils  called a  paterfamilias   had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the humber  which had fallen into alcuin s possession by inheritance  because in early anglo latin writing  paterfamilias    head of a family  householder   usually referred to a ceorl  donald a  bullough suggests that alcuin s family was of cierlisc status   i e    free but subordinate to a noble lord  and that alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy  if so  alcuin s origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as deira 

the young alcuin came to the cathedral church of york during the golden age of archbishop ecgbert and his brother  the northumbrian king eadberht  ecgbert had been a disciple of the venerable bede  who urged him to raise york to an archbishopric  king eadberht and archbishop ecgbert oversaw the re energising and re organisation of the english church  with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that bede had begun  ecgbert was devoted to alcuin  who thrived under his tutelage 

the york school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts  literature  and science  as well as in religious matters  it was from here that alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the frankish court  he revived the school with the trivium and quadrivium disciplines  writing a codex on the trivium  while his student hraban wrote one on the quadrivium 

alcuin graduated to become a teacher during the    s  his ascendancy to the headship of the york school  the ancestor of st peter s school  began after aelbert became archbishop of york in      around the same time alcuin became a deacon in the church  he was never ordained a priest  though there is no real evidence that he took monastic vows  he lived as if he had 

in      king elfwald sent alcuin to rome to petition the pope for official confirmation of york s status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop  eanbald i  on his way home he met charlemagne  whom he had met once before   this time in the italian city of parma 

alcuin s intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join charlemagne s court  he joined an illustrious group of scholars that charlemagne had gathered around him  the mainsprings of the carolingian renaissance  peter of pisa  paulinus of aquileia  rado  and abbot fulrad  alcuin would later write that  the lord was calling me to the service of king charles  

alcuin became master of the palace school of charlemagne in aachen   urbs regale   in      it had been founded by the king s ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children  mostly in manners and the ways of the court   however  charlemagne wanted to include the liberal arts and  most importantly  the study of religion  from     to      alcuin taught charlemagne himself  his sons pepin and louis  as well as young men sent to be educated at court  and the young clerics attached to the palace chapel  bringing with him from york his assistants pyttel  sigewulf  and joseph  alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the palace school  introducing charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning  to the extent that the institution came to be known as the  school of master albinus  

in this role as adviser  he took issue with the emperor s policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death  arguing   faith is a free act of the will  not a forced act  we must appeal to the conscience  not compel it by violence  you can force people to be baptised  but you cannot force them to believe   his arguments seem to have prevailed     charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in     

charlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court  and became far more than just the king at the centre  it seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors  they referred to him as  david   a reference to the biblical king david  alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with charlemagne and the other men at court  where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames  alcuin himself was known as  albinus  or  flaccus   while at aachen  alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils     derived mainly from virgil s  eclogues   according to the  encyclop  dia britannica    he loved charlemagne and enjoyed the king s esteem  but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love 

in     alcuin returned from the court of charlemagne to england  to which he had remained attached  he dwelt there for some time  but charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the adoptionist heresy which was at that time making great progress in toledo  the old capital of the visigoths and still a major city for the christians under islamic rule in spain  he is believed to have had contacts with beatus of li  bana  from the kingdom of asturias  who fought against adoptionism  at the council of frankfurt in      alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by felix of urgel  an heresiarch according to the catholic encyclopaedia  having failed during his stay in northumbria to influence king   thelred in the conduct of his reign  alcuin never returned home 

he was back at charlemagne s court by at least mid      writing a series of letters to   thelred  to hygbald  bishop of lindisfarne  and to   thelhard  archbishop of canterbury in the succeeding months  dealing with the viking attack on lindisfarne in july      these letters and alcuin s poem on the subject   de clade lindisfarnensis monasterii   provide the only significant contemporary account of these events  in his description of the viking attack  he wrote    never before has such terror appeared in britain  behold the church of st cuthbert  splattered with the blood of god s priests  robbed of its ornaments   

in     alcuin was in his sixties  he hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of abbot itherius of saint martin at tours  charlemagne put marmoutier abbey into alcuin s care  with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel  there he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful carolingian minuscule script  ancestor of modern roman typefaces 

alcuin died on    may      some ten years before the emperor  and was buried at st  martin s church under an epitaph that partly read 
the majority of details on alcuin s life come from his letters and poems  there are also autobiographical sections in alcuin s poem on york and in the  vita alcuini   a  life  written for him at ferri  res in the    s  possibly based in part on the memories of sigwulf  one of alcuin s pupils 

the collection of mathematical and logical word problems entitled  propositiones ad acuendos juvenes    problems to sharpen youths   is sometimes attributed to alcuin  in a     letter to charlemagne the scholar claimed to have sent  certain figures of arithmetic for the joy of cleverness   which some scholars have identified with the  propositiones  
the text contains about    mathematical word problems  with solutions   in no particular pedagogical order  among the most famous of these problems are  four that involve river crossings  including the problem of three anxious brothers  each of whom has an unmarried sister whom he cannot leave alone with either of the other men lest she be defiled  problem      the problem of the wolf  goat  and cabbage  problem      and the problem of  the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults   problem      alcuin s sequence is the solution to one of the problems of that book 

alcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it  he had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful calligraphy  the carolingian minuscule based on round and legible uncial letters  he wrote many letters to his english friends  to arno  bishop of salzburg and above all to charlemagne  these letters  of which     are extant  are filled mainly with pious meditations  but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of humanism during the carolingian age  alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety  and it was in the midst of these pursuits that he died 

alcuin is the most prominent figure of the carolingian renaissance  in which three main periods have been distinguished  in the first of these  up to the arrival of alcuin at the court  the italians occupy a central place  in the second  alcuin and the anglo saxons are dominant  in the third  from       the influence of theodulf  the visigoth is preponderant 

alcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work     a grammar and works on rhetoric and dialectics  these are written in the form of dialogues  and in two of them the interlocutors are charlemagne and alcuin  he wrote several theological treatises  a  de fide trinitatis   and commentaries on the bible  alcuin is credited with inventing the first known question mark  though it didn t resemble the modern symbol 

alcuin transmitted to the franks the knowledge of latin culture which had existed in anglo saxon england  a number of his works still exist  besides some graceful epistles in the style of venantius fortunatus  he wrote some long poems  and notably he is the author of a history  in verse  of the church at york   versus de patribus  regibus et sanctis eboracensis ecclesiae  

according to david clark  passages in some of alcuin s writings display homosocial desire  even possibly homoerotic imagery  however  clark says it is not possible to determine whether they were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings  historian john boswell cited this as a personal outpouring of alcuin s internalized homosexual feelings  others agree that alcuin at times  comes perilously close to communicating openly his same sex desires   and this reflects the erotic subculture of the carolingian monastic school  but also perhaps a  queer space  where  erotic attachment and affections may be safely articulated  

erotic and religious love are intertwined in alcuin s writings  and he frequently  eroticizes his personal relationships to his beloved friends   alcuin s friendships also extended to the ladies of the court  especially the queen mother and the king s daughters  though david bromell is of the opinion that alcuin s relationships with these women never reached the intense level of those of the men around him 

alcuin was a close friend of charlemagne s sister gisela  abbess of chelles  whom he  hailed as a noble sister in the bond of sweet love   he wrote to charlemagne s daughters rotrudis and bertha that  the devotion of my heart specially tends towards you both because of the familiarity and dedication you have shown me   his nickname for gisela was  julia   for rotrudis  columba   he dedicated the last two books of his commentary on john s gospel to them both 

the interpretation of homosexual desire has been disputed by allen frantzen  who identifies alcuin s language with that of medieval christian  amicitia  or friendship  karl liersch  in his      inaugural dissertation  cites several passages from poems by theodulf of orleans  in these poems theodulf reports that alcuin had a female muse named delia at the king s court  she was probably charlemagne s daughter   delia is also the addressee of several poems by alcuin 

douglas dales and rowan williams say  the use of language drawn  by alcuin  from the  song of songs  transforms apparently erotic language into something within christian friendship    an ordained affection   

despite inconclusive evidence of alcuin s personal passions  he was clear in his own writings that the men of sodom had been punished with fire for  sinning against nature with men      a view commonly held by the church at the time  such sins  argued alcuin  were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women  for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the flood  and merit to be  withered by flames unto eternal barrenness  

in several churches of the anglican communion  alcuin is celebrated on    may  the first available day after the day of his death  as dunstan is celebrated on    may  

alcuin college  one of the colleges of the university of york  england  is named after him

angilbert

saint angilbert           february       sometimes known as angilberk or engelbert  was a noble frankish poet who was educated under alcuin and served charlemagne as a secretary  diplomat  and son in law  he was venerated as a pre congregation saint and is still honored on the day of his death     february 

angilbert seems to have been brought up at the court of charlemagne at the palace school in aquae grani  aachen   he was educated there as the pupil and then friend of the great english scholar alcuin  when charlemagne sent his young son pepin to italy as king of the lombards angilbert went along as  primicerius palatii   a high administrator of the satellite court  as the friend and adviser of pepin  he assisted for a while in the government of italy  angilbert delivered the document on iconoclasm from the frankish synod of frankfurt to pope adrian i  and was later sent on three important embassies to the pope  in           and      at one time  he served an officer of the maritime provinces  he accompanied charlemagne to rome in     and was one of the witnesses to his will in     

there are various traditions concerning angilbert s relationship with bertha  daughter of charlemagne  one holds that they were married  another that they were not  they had  however  at least two sons and one daughter  one of whom  nithard  became a notable figure in the mid  th century  and the daughter bertha  went on to marry helgaud ii  count of ponthieu  control of marriage and the meanings of legitimacy were hotly contested in the middle ages  bertha and angilbert are an example of how resistance to the idea of a sacramental marriage could coincide with holding church offices  on the other hand  some historians have speculated that charlemagne opposed formal marriages for his daughters out of concern for political rivalries from their potential husbands  none of charlemagne s daughters were married  despite political offers of arranged marriages 

in      he retired to the abbey of centulum  the  monastery of st richarius     at present day saint riquier in picardy  elected abbot in      he rebuilt the monastery and endowed it with a library of     volumes  it was not uncommon for the merovingian  carolingian  or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries  the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation  angilbert  in contrast  spent a great deal rebuilding saint riquier  when he completed it  charlemagne spent easter of the year     there  in keeping with carolingian policies  angilbert established a school at saint riquier to educate the local boys 

his latin poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world  enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family  charlemagne and the other men at court were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames  charlemagne was referred to as  david   a reference to the biblical king david  angilbert was nicknamed  homer  because he wrote poetry  and was the probable author of an epic  of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between charlemagne and leo iii  it is a mosaic from virgil  ovid  lucan and venantius fortunatus  composed in the manner of einhard s use of suetonius  of the shorter poems  besides the greeting to pippin on his return from the campaign against the avars        an epistle to david  i e   charlemagne  incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperor s palace  the reference to bertha  however  is distant and respectful  her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation 

angilbert s poems were published by ernst d  mmler in the  monumenta germaniae historica   for criticisms of this edition  see ludwig traube in max roediger s  schriften f  r germanische philologie

amine

in organic chemistry  amines      are compounds and functional groups that contain a basic nitrogen atom with a lone pair  amines are formally derivatives of ammonia  wherein one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced by a substituent such as an alkyl or aryl group  these may respectively be called alkylamines and arylamines  amines in which both types of substituent are attached to one nitrogen atom may be called alkylarylamines   important amines include amino acids  biogenic amines  trimethylamine  and aniline  see for a list of amines  inorganic derivatives of ammonia are also called amines  such as chloramine  nclh   see  

the substituent  nh is called an amino group 

compounds with a nitrogen atom attached to a carbonyl group  thus having the structure r   co   nr   r     are called amides and have different chemical properties from amines 

amines can be classified according to the nature and number of substituents on nitrogen  aliphatic amines contain only h and alkyl substituents  aromatic amines have the nitrogen atom connected to an aromatic ring 
amines  alkyl and aryl alike  are organized into three subcategories based on the number of carbon atoms adjacent to the nitrogen 


a fourth subcategory is determined by the connectivity of the substituents attached to the nitrogen 

it is also possible to have four organic substituents on the nitrogen  these species are not amines but are quaternary ammonium cations and have a charged nitrogen center  quaternary ammonium salts exist with many kinds of anions 

amines are named in several ways  typically  the compound is given the prefix  amino   or the suffix    amine   the prefix   n    shows substitution on the nitrogen atom  an organic compound with multiple amino groups is called a diamine  triamine  tetraamine and so forth 

systematic names for some common amines 
hydrogen bonding significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines  for example  methyl and ethyl amines are gases under standard conditions  whereas the corresponding methyl and ethyl alcohols are liquids  amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell  liquid amines have a distinctive  fishy  smell 

the nitrogen atom features a lone electron pair that can bind h to form an ammonium ion rnh  the lone electron pair is represented in this article by a two dots above or next to the n  the water solubility of simple amines is enhanced by hydrogen bonding involving these lone electron pairs  typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water  primary ammonium      secondary ammonium      tertiary ammonium  rnh   small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many solvents  whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic  aromatic amines  such as aniline  have their lone pair electrons conjugated into the benzene ring  thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished  their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low 

typically the presence of an amine functional group is deduced by a combination of techniques  including mass spectrometry as well as nmr and ir spectroscopies  h nmr signals for amines disappear upon treatment of the sample with do  in their infrared spectrum primary amines exhibit two n h bands  whereas secondary amines exhibit only one 

alkyl amines characteristically feature tetrahedral nitrogen centers  c n c and c n h angles approach the idealized angle of        c n distances are slightly shorter than c c distances  the energy barrier for the nitrogen inversion of the stereocenter is about    kcal mol for a trialkylamine  the interconversion has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella into a strong wind 

amines of the type nhrr    and nrr   r    are chiral  the nitrogen center bears four substituents counting the lone pair  because of the low barrier to inversion  amines of the type nhrr    cannot be obtained in optical purity  for chiral tertiary amines  nrr   r    can only be resolved when the r  r     and r    groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as n substituted aziridines  quaternary ammonium salts are resolvable  
in aromatic amines   anilines    nitrogen is often nearly planar owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent  the c n distance is correspondingly shorter  in aniline  the c n distance is the same as the c c distances 

like ammonia  amines are bases  compared to alkali metal hydroxides  amines are weaker  see table for examples of conjugate acid  k  values   

the basicity of amines depends on 

owing to inductive effects  the basicity of an amine might be expected to increase with the number of alkyl groups on the amine  correlations are complicated owing to the effects of solvation which are opposite the trends for inductive effects  solvation effects also dominate the basicity of aromatic amines  anilines   for anilines  the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen delocalises into the ring  resulting in decreased basicity  substituents on the aromatic ring  and their positions relative to the amine group  also affect basicity as seen in the table 

solvation significantly affects the basicity of amines  n h groups strongly interact with water  especially in ammonium ions  consequently  the basicity of ammonia is enhanced by    by solvation  the intrinsic basicity of amines  i e  the situation where solvation is unimportant  has been evaluated in the gas phase  in the gas phase  amines exhibit the basicities predicted from the electron releasing effects of the organic substituents  thus tertiary amines are more basic than secondary amines  which are more basic than primary amines  and finally ammonia is least basic  the order of pk s  basicities in water  does not follow this order  similarly aniline is more basic than ammonia in the gas phase  but ten thousand times less so in aqueous solution 

in aprotic polar solvents such as dmso  dmf  and acetonitrile the energy of solvation is not as high as in protic polar solvents like water and methanol  for this reason  the basicity of amines in these aprotic solvents is almost solely governed by the electronic effects 

the most industrially significant amines are prepared from ammonia by alkylation with alcohols 
unlike the reaction of amines with alkyl halides  the industrial method is green insofar that the coproduct is water  the reaction of amines and ammonia with alkyl halides is used for synthesis in the laboratory 
such reactions  which are most useful for alkyl iodides and bromides  are rarely employed because the degree of alkylation is difficult to control  selectivity can be improved via the del  pine reaction  although this is rarely employed on an industrial scale 

via the process of hydrogenation  nitriles are reduced to amines using hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst  reactions are sensitive to acidic or alkaline conditions  which can cause hydrolysis of the    cn group  lialh is more commonly employed for the reduction of nitriles on the laboratory scale  similarly  lialh reduces amides to amines  many amines are produced from aldehydes and ketones via reductive amination  which can either proceed catalytically or stoichiometrically 

aniline  chnh  and its derivatives are prepared by reduction of the nitroaromatics  in industry  hydrogen is the preferred reductant  whereas  in the laboratory  tin and iron are often employed 

many laboratory methods exist for the preparation of amines  many of these methods being rather specialized 

aside from their basicity  the dominant reactivity of amines is their nucleophilicity  most primary amines are good ligands for metal ions to give coordination complexes  amines are alkylated by alkyl halides  acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides react with primary and secondary amines to form amides  the  schotten   baumann reaction   

similarly  with sulfonyl chlorides  one obtains sulfonamides  this transformation  known as the hinsberg reaction  is a chemical test for the presence of amines 

because amines are basic  they neutralize acids to form the corresponding ammonium salts rnh  when formed from carboxylic acids and primary and secondary amines  these salts thermally dehydrate to form the corresponding amides 

amines react with nitrous acid to give diazonium salts  the alkyl diazonium salts are of little synthetic importance because they are too unstable  the most important members are derivatives of aromatic amines such as aniline   phenylamine    a   aryl or naphthyl  

anilines and naphthylamines form more stable diazonium salts  which can be isolated in the crystalline form  diazonium salts undergo a variety of useful transformations involving replacement of the n group with anions  for example  cuprous cyanide gives the corresponding nitriles 

aryldiazonium couple with electron rich aromatic compounds such as a phenol to form azo compounds  such reactions are widely applied to the production of dyes 

imine formation is an important reaction  primary amines react with ketones and aldehydes to form imines  in the case of formaldehyde  r       h   these products typically exist as cyclic trimers 
reduction of these imines gives secondary amines 

similarly  secondary amines react with ketones and aldehydes to form enamines 

an overview of the reactions of amines is given below 
amines are ubiquitous in biology  the breakdown of amino acids releases amines  famously in the case of decaying fish which smell of trimethylamine  many neurotransmitters are amines  including epinephrine  norepinephrine  dopamine  serotonin  and histamine  protonated amino groups    are the most common positively charged moieties in proteins  specifically in the amino acid lysine  the anionic polymer dna is typically bound to various amine rich proteins  additionally  the terminal charged primary ammonium on lysine forms salt bridges with carboxylate groups of other amino acids in polypeptides  which is one of the primary influences on the three dimensional structures of proteins 

primary aromatic amines are used as a starting material for the manufacture of azo dyes  it reacts with nitrous acid to form diazonium salt  which can undergo coupling reaction to form an azo compound  as azo compounds are highly coloured  they are widely used in dyeing industries  such as 


many drugs are designed to mimic or to interfere with the action of natural amine neurotransmitters  exemplified by the amine drugs 

aqueous monoethanolamine  mea   diglycolamine  dga   diethanolamine  dea   diisopropanolamine  dipa  and methyldiethanolamine  mdea  are widely used industrially for removing carbon dioxide  co  and hydrogen sulfide  hs  from natural gas and refinery process streams  they may also be used to remove co from combustion gases and flue gases and may have potential for abatement of greenhouse gases  related processes are known as sweetening 

low molecular weight simple amines  such as ethylamine  are only weakly toxic with ld   between     and      mg kg  they are skin irritants  especially as some are easily absorbed through the skin  amines are a broad class of compounds  and more complex members of the class can be extremely bioactive  for example strychnine and heroin

absolute zero

absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale  a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value  taken as    the fundamental particles of nature have minimal vibrational motion  retaining only quantum mechanical  zero point energy induced particle motion  the theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law  by international agreement  absolute zero is taken as             on the celsius scale  international system of units   which equals             on the fahrenheit scale  united states customary units or imperial units   the corresponding kelvin and rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition 

it is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible  but it is not the lowest  enthalpy  state possible  because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid  and then to solid  and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization  gas to liquid  and enthalpy of fusion  liquid to solid  exceeds the ideal gas s change in enthalpy to absolute zero  in the quantum mechanical description  matter  solid  at absolute zero is in its ground state  the point of lowest internal energy 

the laws of thermodynamics indicate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means  because the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically  and a system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanical zero point energy  the energy of its ground state at absolute zero  the kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed  
scientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero  where matter exhibits quantum effects such as superconductivity and superfluidity 

at temperatures near   nearly all molecular motion ceases and    s        for any adiabatic process  where  s  is the entropy  in such a circumstance  pure substances can  ideally  form perfect crystals as  t         max planck s strong form of the third law of thermodynamics states the entropy of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero  the original nernst  heat theorem  makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any isothermal process approaches zero as  t        

the implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal simply approaches a constant value 

the nernst postulate identifies the isotherm t       as coincident with the adiabat s        although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct  as no two adiabats intersect  no other adiabat can intersect the t       isotherm  consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature        callen  pp             

a perfect crystal is one in which the internal lattice structure extends uninterrupted in all directions  the perfect order can be represented by translational symmetry along three  not usually orthogonal  axes  every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place  whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping  for substances that exist in two  or more  stable crystalline forms  such as diamond and graphite for carbon  there is a kind of  chemical degeneracy   the question remains whether both can have zero entropy at  t        even though each is perfectly ordered 

perfect crystals never occur in practice  imperfections  and even entire amorphous material inclusions  can and do simply get  frozen in  at low temperatures  so transitions to more stable states do not occur 

using the debye model  the specific heat and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to  t   while the enthalpy and chemical potential are proportional to  t    guggenheim  p        these quantities drop toward their  t        limiting values and approach with  zero  slopes  for the specific heats at least  the limiting value itself is definitely zero  as borne out by experiments to below     k  even the less detailed einstein model shows this curious drop in specific heats  in fact  all specific heats vanish at absolute zero  not just those of crystals  likewise for the coefficient of thermal expansion  maxwell s relations show that various other quantities also vanish  these phenomena were unanticipated 

since the relation between changes in gibbs free energy   g    the enthalpy   h   and the entropy is

thus  as  t  decreases     g  and    h  approach each other  so long as    s  is bounded   experimentally  it is found that all spontaneous processes  including chemical reactions  result in a decrease in  g  as they proceed toward equilibrium  if    s  and or  t  are small  the condition    g        may imply that    h         which would indicate an exothermic reaction  however  this is not required  endothermic reactions can proceed spontaneously if the  t    s  term is large enough 

moreover  the slopes of the derivatives of    g  and    h  converge and are equal to zero at  t         this ensures that    g  and    h  are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate empirical principle of thomsen and berthelot  which states that  the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one that evolves the greatest amount of heat   i e   an actual process is the  most exothermic one    callen  pp             

one model that estimates the properties of an electron gas at absolute zero in metals is the fermi gas  the electrons  being fermions  must be in different quantum states  which leads the electrons to get very high typical velocities  even at absolute zero  the maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the fermi energy  the fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by boltzmann s constant  and is of the order of        k for typical electron densities found in metals  for temperatures significantly below the fermi temperature  the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero  this explains the failure of the classical equipartition theorem for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late   th century 

a bose   einstein condensate  bec  is a state of matter of a dilute gas of weakly interacting bosons confined in an external potential and cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero  under such conditions  a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest quantum state of the external potential  at which point quantum effects become apparent on a macroscopic scale 

this state of matter was first predicted by satyendra nath bose and albert einstein in            bose first sent a paper to einstein on the quantum statistics of light quanta  now called photons   einstein was impressed  translated the paper from english to german and submitted it for bose to the  zeitschrift f  r physik   which published it  einstein then extended bose s ideas to material particles  or matter  in two other papers 

seventy years later  in       the first gaseous condensate was produced by eric cornell and carl wieman at the university of colorado at boulder nist jila lab  using a gas of rubidium atoms cooled to      nanokelvins  nk     

a record cold temperature of            picokelvins  pk     in a bose   einstein condensate  bec  of sodium atoms was achieved in      by researchers at mit  the associated black body  peak emittance  wavelength of       kilometers is roughly the radius of earth 

absolute  or thermodynamic  temperature is conventionally measured in kelvins  celsius scaled increments  and in the rankine scale  fahrenheit scaled increments  with increasing rarity  absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the  degree   so the  ratios  of two absolute temperatures   t   t   are the same in all scales  the most transparent definition of this standard comes from the maxwell   boltzmann distribution  it can also be found in fermi   dirac statistics  for particles of half integer spin  and bose   einstein statistics  for particles of integer spin   all of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing exponential functions of energy  at the particle level  over  kt   with  k  representing the boltzmann constant and  t  representing the temperature observed at the macroscopic level 

temperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar celsius or fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales  certain systems can achieve truly negative temperatures  that is  their thermodynamic temperature  expressed in kelvins  can be of a negative quantity  a system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero  rather  a system with a negative temperature is hotter than  any  system with a positive temperature  in the sense that if a negative temperature system and a positive temperature system come in contact  heat flows from the negative to the positive temperature system 

most familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their entropy  however  some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold  and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease  because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy  such a system s temperature becomes negative  even though energy is being added  as a result  the boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy  therefore  no complete system  i e  including the electromagnetic modes  can have negative temperatures  since there is no highest energy state  so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures  however  for quasi equilibrium systems  e g  spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field  this argument does not apply  and negative effective temperatures are attainable 

on   january       physicists announced that they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom for the first time 

one of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was robert boyle  his       new experiments and observations touching cold   articulated the dispute known as the  primum frigidum   the concept was well known among naturalists of the time  some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth  as one of the four classical elements   others within water  others air  and some more recently within nitre  but all of them seemed to agree that   there is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality  

the question whether there is a limit to the degree of coldness possible  and  if so  where the zero must be placed  was first addressed by the french physicist guillaume amontons in       in connection with his improvements in the air thermometer  his instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury   the volume  or  spring  of the air varying with temperature  amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing  he used a scale that marked the boiling point of water at     and the melting point of ice at    so that the zero was equivalent to about        on the celsius scale 

this close approximation to the modern value of              c for the zero of the air thermometer was further improved upon in      by johann heinrich lambert  who observed that might be regarded as absolute cold 

values of this order for the absolute zero were not  however  universally accepted about this period  pierre simon laplace and antoine lavoisier  in their      treatise on heat  arrived at values ranging from       to       below the freezing point of water  and thought that in any case it must be at least     below  john dalton in his  chemical philosophy  gave ten calculations of this value  and finally adopted            c as the natural zero of temperature 

after james prescott joule had determined the mechanical equivalent of heat  lord kelvin approached the question from an entirely different point of view  and in      devised a scale of absolute temperature that was independent of the properties of any particular substance and was based on carnot s theory of the motive power of heat and data published by henri victor regnault  it followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at           c  at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air thermometer  this value was not immediately accepted  values ranging from to   derived from laboratory measurements and observations of astronomical refraction  remained in use in the early   th century 

with a better theoretical understanding of absolute zero  scientists were eager to reach this temperature in the lab  by       michael faraday had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist  and reached a new record for lowest temperatures by reaching   faraday believed that certain gases  such as oxygen  nitrogen  and hydrogen  were permanent gases and could not be liquefied  decades later  in      dutch theoretical scientist johannes diderik van der waals demonstrated that these gases could be liquefied  but only under conditions of very high pressure and very low temperatures  in       louis paul cailletet in france and raoul pictet in switzerland succeeded in producing the first droplets of liquid air   this was followed in      by the production of liquid oxygen by the polish professors zygmunt wr  blewski and karol olszewski 

scottish chemist and physicist james dewar and the dutch physicist heike kamerlingh onnes took on the challenge to liquefy the remaining gases hydrogen and helium  in       after    years of effort  dewar was first to liquefy hydrogen  reaching a new low temperature record of   however onnes  his rival  was the first to liquefy helium  in       using several precooling stages and the hampson   linde cycle  he lowered the temperature to the boiling point of helium   by reducing the pressure of the liquid helium he achieved an even lower temperature  near     k  these were the coldest temperatures achieved on earth at the time and his achievement earned him the nobel prize in       onnes would continue to study the properties of materials at temperatures near absolute zero  describing superconductivity and superfluids for the first time 

the average temperature of the universe today is approximately   based on measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation 

absolute zero cannot be achieved  although it is possible to reach temperatures close to it through the use of cryocoolers  dilution refrigerators  and nuclear adiabatic demagnetization  the use of laser cooling has produced temperatures less than a billionth of a kelvin  at very low temperatures in the vicinity of absolute zero  matter exhibits many unusual properties  including superconductivity  superfluidity  and bose   einstein condensation  to study such phenomena  scientists have worked to obtain even lower temperatures 






adiabatic process

in thermodynamics  an adiabatic process is one that occurs without transfer of heat or mass of substances between a thermodynamic system and its surroundings  in an adiabatic process  energy is transferred to the surroundings only as work  the adiabatic process provides a rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the first law of thermodynamics  and as such it is a key concept in thermodynamics 

some chemical and physical processes occur so rapidly that they may be conveniently described by the term  adiabatic approximation   meaning that there is not enough time for the transfer of energy as heat to take place to or from the system 

by way of example  the adiabatic flame temperature is an idealization that uses the  adiabatic approximation  so as to provide an upper limit calculation of temperatures produced by combustion of a fuel  the adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature that would be achieved by a flame if the process of combustion took place in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings 

in meteorology and oceanography  the adiabatic cooling process produces condensation of moisture or salinity and the parcel becomes oversaturated  therefore  it is necessary to take away the excess  there the process becomes a  pseudo adiabatic process  in which the liquid water salt that condenses is assumed to be removed as soon as it is formed  by idealized instantaneous precipitation  the pseudoadiabatic process is only defined for expansion  since a parcel that is compressed become warmer and remains undersaturated 

a process that does not involve the transfer of heat or matter into or out of a system  so that   is called an adiabatic process  and such a system is said to be adiabatically isolated  the assumption that a process is adiabatic is a frequently made simplifying assumption  for example  the compression of a gas within a cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process  little of the system s energy can be transferred out as heat to the surroundings  even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive  that process is idealized to be adiabatic  the same can be said to be true for the expansion process of such a system 

the assumption of adiabatic isolation of a system is a useful one  and is often combined with others so as to make the calculation of the system s behaviour possible  such assumptions are idealizations  the behaviour of actual machines deviates from these idealizations  but the assumption of such  perfect  behaviour provide a useful first approximation of how the real world works  according to laplace  when sound travels in a gas  there is no time for heat conduction in the medium and so the propagation of sound is adiabatic  for such an adiabatic process  the modulus of elasticity  young s modulus  can be expressed as   where is the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and at constant volume     and is the pressure of the gas  

for a closed system  one may write the first law of thermodynamics as     where denotes the change of the system s internal energy  the quantity of energy added to it as heat  and the work done on it by its surroundings 


naturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible  entropy is produced  

the transfer of energy as work into an adiabatically isolated system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds  in one such kind  there is no entropy produced within the system  no friction  viscous dissipation  etc    and the work is only pressure volume work  denoted by    in nature  this ideal kind occurs only approximately  because it demands an infinitely slow process and no sources of dissipation 

the other extreme kind of work is isochoric work     for which energy is added as work solely through friction or viscous dissipation within the system  a stirrer that transfers energy to a viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls  without phase change  will cause a rise in temperature of the fluid  but that work is not recoverable  isochoric work is irreversible  the second law of thermodynamics observes that a natural process  of transfer of energy as work  always consists at least of isochoric work and often both of these extreme kinds of work  every natural process  adiabatic or not  is irreversible  with   as friction or viscosity are always present to some extent 

the adiabatic compression of a gas causes a rise in temperature of the gas  adiabatic expansion against pressure  or a spring  causes a drop in temperature  in contrast  free expansion is an isothermal process for an ideal gas 

adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings  e g   a piston compressing a gas contained within a cylinder and raising the temperature where in many practical situations heat conduction through walls can be slow compared with the compression time  this finds practical application in diesel engines which rely on the lack of heat dissipation during the compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it 

adiabatic heating occurs in the earth s atmosphere when an air mass descends  for example  in a katabatic wind  foehn wind  or chinook wind flowing downhill over a mountain range  when a parcel of air descends  the pressure on the parcel increases  due to this increase in pressure  the parcel s volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air  thus increasing its internal energy  which manifests itself by a rise in the temperature of that mass of air  the parcel of air can only slowly dissipate the energy by conduction or radiation  heat   and to a first approximation it can be considered adiabatically isolated and the process an adiabatic process 

adiabatic cooling occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased  allowing it to expand  thus causing it to do work on its surroundings  when the pressure applied on a parcel of air is reduced  the air in the parcel is allowed to expand  as the volume increases  the temperature falls as its internal energy decreases  adiabatic cooling occurs in the earth s atmosphere with orographic lifting and lee waves  and this can form pileus or lenticular clouds 

adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid  one technique used to reach very low temperatures  thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero  is via adiabatic demagnetisation  where the change in magnetic field on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling  also  the contents of an expanding universe can be described  to first order  as an adiabatically cooling fluid   see heat death of the universe  

rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption  particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as kimberlites 

such temperature changes can be quantified using the ideal gas law  or the hydrostatic equation for atmospheric processes 

in practice  no process is truly adiabatic  many processes rely on a large difference in time scales of the process of interest and the rate of heat dissipation across a system boundary  and thus are approximated by using an adiabatic assumption  there is always some heat loss  as no perfect insulators exist 

the mathematical equation for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible  i e   no entropy generation  adiabatic process can be represented by the polytropic process equation 
where is pressure  is volume  and for this case   where 

for a monatomic ideal gas    and for a diatomic gas  such as nitrogen and oxygen  the main components of air    note that the above formula is only applicable to classical ideal gases and not bose   einstein or fermi gases 

for reversible adiabatic processes  it is also true that

where  t  is an absolute temperature  this can also be written as

the compression stroke in a gasoline engine can be used as an example of adiabatic compression  the model assumptions are  the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is one litre     l         cm          m   the gas within is the air consisting of molecular nitrogen and oxygen only  thus a diatomic gas with   degrees of freedom  and so    the compression ratio of the engine is       that is  the    l volume of uncompressed gas is reduced to      l by the piston   and the uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure  a warm room temperature of        c  or      k  and a pressure of    bar        kpa  i e  typical sea level atmospheric pressure  

so our adiabatic constant for this example is about       pa   m 

the gas is now compressed to a      l          m  volume  we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas through the walls   the adiabatic constant remains the same  but with the resulting pressure unknown

so solving for  p  

or       bar  note that this pressure increase is more than a simple      compression ratio would indicate  this is because the gas is not only compressed  but the work done to compress the gas also increases its internal energy  which manifests itself by a rise in the gas temperature and an additional rise in pressure above what would result from a simplistic calculation of    times the original pressure 

we can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well  using the ideal gas law   pv       nrt    n  is amount of gas in moles and  r  the gas constant for that gas   our initial conditions being      kpa of pressure     l volume  and      k of temperature  our experimental constant   nr   is 

we know the compressed gas has          l and       so we can solve for temperature 

that is a final temperature of      k  or        c  or        f  well above the ignition point of many fuels  this is why a high compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self ignite  which would cause engine knocking when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure   or that a supercharger with an intercooler to provide a pressure boost but with a lower temperature rise would be advantageous  a diesel engine operates under even more extreme conditions  with compression ratios of      or more being typical  in order to provide a very high gas temperature  which ensures immediate ignition of the injected fuel 

for an adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas  the gas is contained in an insulated container and then allowed to expand in a vacuum  because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against  the work done by or on the system is zero  since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work  the first law of thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero  for an ideal gas  the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case  since at constant temperature  the entropy is proportional to the volume  the entropy increases in this case  therefore this process is irreversible 

the definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero    then  according to the first law of thermodynamics 

where is the change in the internal energy of the system and is work done  by  the system  any work    done must be done at the expense of internal energy   since no heat is being supplied from the surroundings  pressure   volume work done  by  the system is defined as

however  does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but instead changes along with  

it is desired to know how the values of and relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds  for an ideal gas the internal energy is given by

where is the number of degrees of freedom divided by two  is the universal gas constant and is the number of moles in the system  a constant  

differentiating equation     and use of the ideal gas law    yields

equation     is often expressed as because  

now substitute equations     and     into equation     to obtain

factorize  

and divide both sides by  

after integrating the left and right sides from to and from to and changing the sides respectively 

exponentiate both sides  substitute with   the heat capacity ratio

and eliminate the negative sign to obtain

therefore 

and

substituting the ideal gas law into the above  we obtain

which simplifies to

the change in internal energy of a system  measured from state   to state    is equal to

at the same time  the work done by the pressure   volume changes as a result from this process  is equal to

since we require the process to be adiabatic  the following equation needs to be true

by the previous derivation 

rearranging     gives

substituting this into     gives

substituting this expression and     in     gives

an adiabat is a curve of constant entropy in a diagram  some properties of adiabats on a  p     v  diagram are indicated  these properties may be read from the classical behaviour of ideal gases  except in the region where  pv  becomes small  low temperature   where quantum effects become important 


the following diagram is a  p     v  diagram with a superposition of adiabats and isotherms 

the isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves 

the adiabats are isentropic 

volume is the horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis 

the term  adiabatic     is an anglicization of the greek term                      impassable   used by xenophon of rivers  
it is used in the thermodynamic sense by rankine         and adopted by maxwell in       explicitly attributing the term to rankine   
the etymological origin corresponds here to an impossibility of transfer of energy as heat and of transfer of matter across the wall  

the greek word                     is formed from privative        not   and                    passable   in turn deriving from          through    and                   to walk  go  come   

the adiabatic process has been important for thermodynamics since its early days  it was important in the work of joule  because it provided a way of nearly directly relating quantities of heat and work 

for a thermodynamic system that is enclosed by walls that do not allow mass transfer  energy can pass in and out only as heat or work  thus a quantity of work can be related almost directly to an equivalent quantity of heat in a cycle of two limbs  the first is an isochoric adiabatic work process that adds to the system s internal energy  then an isochoric and workless heat transfer returns the system to its original state  the first limb adds a definite amount of energy and the second removes it  accordingly  rankine measured quantity of heat in units of work  rather than as a calorimetric quantity   in       rankine used a quantity that he called  the thermodynamic function  that later was called entropy  and at that time he wrote also of the  curve of no transmission of heat   which he later called an adiabatic curve  besides it two isothermal limbs  carnot s cycle has two adiabatic limbs 

for the foundations of thermodynamics  the conceptual importance of this was emphasized by bryan  by carath  odory  and by born  the reason is that calorimetry presupposes a type of temperature as already defined before the statement of the first law of thermodynamics  such as one based on empirical scales  such a presupposition involves making the distinction between empirical temperature and absolute temperature  rather  the definition of absolute thermodynamic temperature is best left till the second law is available as a conceptual basis 

in the eighteenth century  the law of conservation of energy was yet to be fully formulated or established  and the nature of heat was debated  one approach to these problems was to regard heat  measured by calorimetry  as a primary substance that is conserved in quantity  by the middle of the nineteenth century  it was recognized as a form of energy  and the law of conservation of energy was thereby also recognized  the view that eventually established itself  and is currently regarded as right  is that the law of conservation of energy is a primary axiom  and that heat is to be analyzed as consequential  in this light  heat cannot be a component of the total energy of a single body because it is not a state variable  but  rather  is a variable that describes a process of transfer between two bodies  the adiabatic process is important because it is a logical ingredient of this current view 

this present article is written from the viewpoint of macroscopic thermodynamics  and the word  adiabatic  is used in this article in the traditional way of thermodynamics  introduced by rankine  it is pointed out in the present article that  for example  if a compression of a gas is rapid  then there is little time for heat transfer to occur  even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall  in this sense  a rapid compression of a gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be  adiabatic   though often far from isentropic  even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall 

quantum mechanics and quantum statistical mechanics  however  use the word  adiabatic  in a very different sense  one that can at times seem almost opposite to the classical thermodynamic sense  in quantum theory  the word  adiabatic  can mean something perhaps near isentropic  or perhaps near quasi static  but the usage of the word is very different between the two disciplines 

on the one hand  in quantum theory  if a perturbative element of compressive work is done almost infinitely slowly  that is to say quasi statically   it is said to have been done  adiabatically   the idea is that the shapes of the eigenfunctions change slowly and continuously  so that no quantum jump is triggered  and the change is virtually reversible  while the occupation numbers are unchanged  nevertheless there is change in the energy levels of one to one corresponding  pre  and post compression  eigenstates  thus a perturbative element of work has been done without heat transfer and without introduction of random change within the system  for example  max born writes  actually  it is usually the  adiabatic  case with which we have to do  i e  the limiting case where the external force  or the reaction of the parts of the system on each other  acts very slowly  in this case  to a very high approximation

that is  there is no probability for a transition  and the system is in the initial state after cessation of the perturbation  such a slow perturbation is therefore reversible  as it is classically  

on the other hand  in quantum theory  if a perturbative element of compressive work is done rapidly  it randomly changes the occupation numbers of the eigenstates  as well as changing their shapes  in that theory  such a rapid change is said not to be  adiabatic   and the contrary word  diabatic  is applied to it  one might guess that perhaps clausius  if he were confronted with this  in the now obsolete language he used in his day  would have said that  internal work  was done and that  heat was generated though not transferred  

in classical thermodynamics  such a rapid change would still be called adiabatic because the system is adiabatically isolated  and there is no transfer of energy as heat  the strong irreversibility of the change  due to viscosity or other entropy production  does not impinge on this classical usage 

thus for a mass of gas  in macroscopic thermodynamics  words are so used that a compression is sometimes loosely or approximately said to be adiabatic if it is rapid enough to avoid heat transfer  even if the system is not adiabatically isolated  but in quantum statistical theory  a compression is not called adiabatic if it is rapid  even if the system is adiabatically isolated in the classical thermodynamic sense of the term  the words are used differently in the two disciplines  as stated just above 







amide

an amide   or or    also known as an acid amide  is a compound with the functional group re o nr     r and r    refer to h or organic groups   most common are carboxamides  organic amides    n         e     c   x          but many other important types of amides are known  including phosphoramides   n         e     p   x        and many related formulas  and sulfonamides  e     s   x          the term amide refers both to  classes of compounds  and to the  functional group   re o nr     within those compounds 

amide can also refer to the conjugate base of ammonia  the anion hn  or of an organic amine  an anion rn   for discussion of these  anionic amides   see alkali metal amides 

due to the dual use of the word  amide   there is debate as to how to properly and unambiguously name the derived  anions  of amides in the first sense  i e   deprotonated acylated amines   a few of which are commonly used as nonreactive counterions  

the remainder of this article is about the carbonyl   nitrogen sense of  amide  

the simplest amides are derivatives of ammonia wherein one hydrogen atom has been replaced by an acyl group  the ensemble is generally represented as rc o nh and is described as a primary amide  closely related and even more numerous are secondary amides which can be derived from primary amines  r   nh  and have the formula rc o nhr     tertiary amides are commonly derived from secondary amines  r   r   nh  and have the general structure rc o nr   r     amides are usually regarded as derivatives of carboxylic acids in which the hydroxyl group has been replaced by an amine or ammonia 
the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen is delocalized into the carbonyl  thus forming a partial double bond between n and the carbonyl carbon  consequently  the nitrogen in amides is not pyramidal  it is estimated that acetamide is described by resonance structure a for     and by b for      which does not sum to      because there are additional resonance forms that are not depicted in the above figure   one final thing to note when looking at the bonds of an amide is that there is also a hydrogen bond present between the active groups hydrogen and nitrogen atoms 

in the usual nomenclature  one adds the term  amide  to the stem of the parent acid s name  for instance  the amide derived from acetic acid is named acetamide  chconh   iupac recommends ethanamide  but this and related formal names are rarely encountered  when the amide is derived from a primary or secondary amine  the substituents on nitrogen are indicated first in the name  thus  the amide formed from dimethylamine and acetic acid is  n   n  dimethylacetamide  chconme  where me   ch   usually even this name is simplified to dimethylacetamide  cyclic amides are called lactams  they are necessarily secondary or tertiary amides  functional groups consisting of    p o nr and    sonr are phosphonamides and sulfonamides  respectively  

some chemists make a pronunciation distinction between the two  saying for the carbonyl   nitrogen compound and for the anion  others replace one of these with   while still others pronounce both   making them homonyms 

compared to amines  amides are very weak bases  while the conjugate acid of an amine has a p k  of about      the conjugate acid of an amide has a p k  around         therefore  amides don t have as clearly noticeable acid   base properties in water  this relative lack of basicity is explained by the electron withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group where the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen is delocalized by resonance  on the other hand  amides are much stronger bases than carboxylic acids  esters  aldehydes  and ketones  their conjugate acids  p k s are between      and         it is estimated in silico that acetamide is represented by resonance structure a for     and by b for      resonance is largely prevented in the very strained quinuclidone 

because of the greater electronegativity of oxygen  the carbonyl  c o  is a stronger dipole than the n   c dipole  the presence of a c o dipole and  to a lesser extent a n   c dipole  allows amides to act as h bond acceptors  in primary and secondary amides  the presence of n   h dipoles allows amides to function as h bond donors as well  thus amides can participate in hydrogen bonding with water and other protic solvents  the oxygen atom can accept hydrogen bonds from water and the n   h hydrogen atoms can donate h bonds  as a result of interactions such as these  the water solubility of amides is greater than that of corresponding hydrocarbons 

the proton of a primary or secondary amide does not dissociate readily under normal conditions  its p k  is usually well above     conversely  under extremely acidic conditions  the carbonyl oxygen can become protonated with a p k  of roughly      

the solubilities of amides and esters are roughly comparable  typically amides are less soluble than comparable amines and carboxylic acids since these compounds can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds  tertiary amides  with the important exception of  n   n  dimethylformamide  exhibit low solubility in water 

the presence of the functional group is generally easily established  at least in small molecules  they are the most common non basic functional group  they can be distinguished from nitro and cyano groups by their ir spectra  amides exhibit a moderately intense      band near       cm  by h nmr spectroscopy  conhr signals occur at low fields  in x ray crystallography  the c o n center together with the three immediately adjacent atoms characteristically define a plane 

amides are pervasive in nature and technology as structural materials  the amide linkage is easily formed  confers structural rigidity  and resists hydrolysis  nylons are polyamides  as are the very resilient materials aramid  twaron  and kevlar  amide linkages constitute a defining molecular feature of proteins  the secondary structure of which is due in part to the hydrogen bonding abilities of amides  amide linkages in a biochemical context are called peptide bonds when they occur in the main chain of a protein and isopeptide bonds when they occur to a side chain of the protein  proteins can have structural roles  such as in hair or spider silk  but also nearly all enzymes are proteins  low molecular weight amides  such as dimethylformamide  hc o n ch    are common solvents  many drugs are amides  including paracetamol  penicillin and lsd  moreover  plant  n  alkylamides have a wide range of biological functionalities 

many methods exist in amide synthesis  on paper  the simplest method for making amides is by coupling a carboxylic acid with an amine  in general this reaction is thermodynamically favorable  however it suffers from a high activation energy  largely due to the amine first deprotonating the carboxylic acid  which reduces its reactivity  as such the direct reaction often requires high temperatures 

many methods are known for driving the equilibrium to the right  for the most part these reactions involve  activating  the carboxylic acid by first converting it to a better electrophile  such as esters  acid chlorides  schotten baumann reaction  or anhydrides  lumi  re   barbier method   conventional methods in peptide synthesis use coupling agents such as hatu  hobt  or pybop  in recent years there has also been a surge in the development of boron reagents for amide bond formation  including catalytic use of   iodophenylboronic acid or miba  and tris       trifluoroethyl  borate 

dehydrogenative acylation of amines is catalyzed by organoruthenium complexes 

the reaction proceed by one dehydrogenation of the alcohol to the aldehyde followed by formation of a hemiaminal  which undergoes a second dehydrogenation to the amide  elimination of water in the hemiaminal to the imine is not observed 

transamidation is typically very slow  but it is accelerated with lewis acid and organometallic catalysts 

primary amides  rc o nh  are more amenable to this reaction 

amides undergo many chemical reactions  although they are less reactive than esters  amides hydrolyse in hot alkali as well as in strong acidic conditions  acidic conditions yield the carboxylic acid and the ammonium ion while basic hydrolysis yield the carboxylate ion and ammonia  amides are also versatile precursors to many other functional groups  electrophiles attack the carbonyl oxygen  this step often precedes hydrolysis  which is catalyzed by both br  nsted acids and lewis acids  enzymes  e g  peptidases and artificial catalysts  are known to accelerate the hydrolysis reactions 






animism

animism  from latin      breath  spirit  life   is the religious belief that objects  places and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence  potentially  animism perceives all things   animals  plants  rocks  rivers  weather systems  human handiwork and perhaps even words   as animated and alive  animism is the world s oldest religion   animism predates any form of organized religion and is said to contain the oldest spiritual and supernatural perspective in the world  it dates back to the paleolithic age  to a time when     humans roamed the plains hunting and gathering  and communing with the spirit of nature  

animism is used in the anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system of many indigenous peoples  especially in contrast to the relatively more recent development of organised religions  although each culture has its own different mythologies and rituals   animism  is said to describe the most common  foundational thread of indigenous peoples   spiritual  or  supernatural  perspectives  the animistic perspective is so widely held and inherent to most indigenous peoples that they often do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to  animism   or even  religion    the term is an anthropological construct 

largely due to such ethnolinguistic and cultural discrepancies  opinion has differed on whether  animism  refers to an ancestral mode of experience common to indigenous peoples around the world  or to a full fledged religion in its own right  the currently accepted definition of animism was only developed in the late   th century        by sir edward tylor  who created it as  one of anthropology s earliest concepts  if not the first  

animism encompasses the beliefs that all material phenomena have agency  that there exists no hard and fast distinction between the spiritual and physical  or material  world and that soul or spirit or sentience exists not only in humans  but also in other animals  plants  rocks  geographic features such as mountains or rivers or other entities of the natural environment  including thunder  wind and shadows  animism thus rejects cartesian dualism  animism may further attribute souls to abstract concepts such as words  true names or metaphors in mythology  some members of the non tribal world also consider themselves animists  such as author daniel quinn  sculptor lawson oyekan and many contemporary pagans  

earlier anthropological perspectives  which have since been termed the  old animism   were concerned with knowledge on what is alive and what factors make something alive  the  old animism  assumed that animists were individuals who were unable to understand the difference between persons and things 
critics of the  old animism  have accused it of preserving  colonialist and dualist worldviews and rhetoric  

the idea of animism was developed by the anthropologist sir edward tylor in his      book  primitive culture   in which he defined it as  the general doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings in general   according to tylor  animism often includes  an idea of pervading life and will in nature   a belief that natural objects other than humans have souls  that formulation was little different from that proposed by auguste comte as  fetishism   but the terms now have distinct meanings 

for tylor  animism represented the earliest form of religion  being situated within an evolutionary framework of religion which has developed in stages and which will ultimately lead to humanity rejecting religion altogether in favor of scientific rationality 
thus  for tylor  animism was fundamentally seen as a mistake  a basic error from which all religion grew  he did not believe that animism was inherently illogical  but he suggested that it arose from early humans  dreams and visions and thus was a rational system  however  it was based on erroneous  unscientific observations about the nature of reality  stringer notes that his reading of  primitive culture  led him to believe that tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to  primitive  populations than many of his contemporaries and that tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of  savage  people and westerners 

tylor had initially wanted to describe the phenomenon as  spiritualism  but realised that would cause confusion with the modern religion of spiritualism  that was then prevalent across western nations  he adopted the term  animism  from the writings of the german scientist georg ernst stahl  who  in       had developed the term    as a biological theory that souls formed the vital principle and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes  the first known usage in english appeared in      

the idea that there had once been  one universal form of primitive religion   whether labelled  animism    totemism   or  shamanism   has been dismissed as  unsophisticated  and  erroneous  by the archaeologist timothy insoll  who stated that  it removes complexity  a precondition of religion now  in  all  its variants  

tylor s definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of  primitive society  by lawyers  theologians and philologists  the debate defined the field of research of a new science  anthropology  by the end of the   th century  an orthodoxy on  primitive society  had emerged  but few anthropologists still would accept that definition  the    th century armchair anthropologists  argued  primitive society   an evolutionary category  was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous descent groups related by a series of marriage exchanges  their religion was animism  the belief that natural species and objects had souls  with the development of private property  the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state  these rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of  developed  religions  according to tylor  the more scientifically advanced a society became  the fewer members of that society believed in animism  however  any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits  to tylor  represented  survivals  of the original animism of early humanity 

in       three years after tylor proposed his definition of animism   the edinburgh lawyer  john ferguson mclennan  argued that the animistic thinking evident in fetishism gave rise to a religion he named totemism  primitive people believed  he argued  that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal  subsequent debate by the  armchair anthropologists   including j  j  bachofen    mile durkheim and sigmund freud  remained focused on totemism rather than animism  with few directly challenging tylor s definition  indeed  anthropologists  have commonly avoided the issue of animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich ethnographies  

according to the anthropologist tim ingold  animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life  whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source  such as the land itself or the ancestors  who provide the basis to life  certain indigenous religious groups such as the australian aboriginals are more typically totemic  whereas others like the inuit are more typically animistic in their worldview 

from his studies into child development  jean piaget suggested that children were born with an innate animist worldview in which they anthropomorphized inanimate objects  and that it was only later that they grew out of this belief  conversely  from her ethnographic research  margaret mead argued the opposite  believing that children were not born with an animist worldview but that they became acculturated to such beliefs as they were educated by their society 
stewart guthrie saw animism     or  attribution  as he preferred it     as an evolutionary strategy to aid survival  he argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats  his suggested explanation  however  did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to religion 

in       guthrie suggested that the  most widespread  concept of animism was that it was the  attribution of spirits to natural phenomena
such as stones and trees  

many anthropologists ceased using the term  animism   deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic  however  the term had also been claimed by religious groups     namely indigenous communities and nature worshipers     who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs  and who in some cases actively identified as  animists   it was thus readopted by various scholars  however they began using the term in a different way  placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other persons  some of whom aren t human  as the religious studies scholar graham harvey stated  while the  old animist  definition had been problematic  the term  animism  was nevertheless  of considerable value as a critical  academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world  
the  new animism  emerged largely from the publications of the anthropologist irving hallowell which were produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the ojibwe communities of canada in the mid   th century  for the ojibwe encountered by hallowell   personhood  did not require human likeness  but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons  who for instance included rock persons and bear persons  for the ojibwe  these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others  through respectfully interacting with other persons  they themselves learned to  act as a person   hallowell s approach to the understanding of ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism  he emphasized the need to challenge the modernist  western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide views 

hallowell s approach influenced the work of anthropologist nurit bird david  who produced a scholarly article reassessing the idea of animism in       seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal  debating bird david s ideas 

more recently post modern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism  modernism is characterized by a cartesian subject object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective  and culture from nature  in this view  animism is the inverse of scientism  and hence inherently invalid  drawing on the work of bruno latour  these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions  and theorize that all societies continue to  animate  the world around them  and not just as a tylorian survival of primitive thought  rather  the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our  professional subcultures   which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity  we  like animists  also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so called objective world  whether pets  cars or teddy bears  who we recognize as subjects  as such  these entities are  approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists   these approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans  and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul 

nurit bird david argues that  positivistic ideas about the meaning of  nature    life  and  personhood  misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts  classical theoreticians  it is argued  attributed their own modernist ideas of self to  primitive peoples  while asserting that the  primitive peoples  read their idea of self into others   she argues that animism is a  relational epistemology   and not a tylorian failure of primitive reasoning  that is  self identity among animists is based on their relationships with others  rather than some distinctive feature of the self  instead of focusing on the essentialized  modernist self  the  individual    persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships   dividuals    some of which are with  superpersons   i e  non humans  

guthrie expressed criticism of bird david s attitude toward animism  believing that it promulgated the view that  the world is in large measure whatever our local imagination makes it   this  he felt  would result in anthropology abandoning  the scientific project  

tim ingold  like bird david  argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment   hunter gatherers do not  as a rule  approach their environment as an external world of nature that has to be  grasped  intellectually       indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice   willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this cartesian dualism  and that the animist self identifies with the world   feeling at once  within  and  apart  from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit   the animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter  but  through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint  senses  and sensibilities of his prey  to be one with it  shamanism  in this view  is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey 

cultural ecologist and philosopher david abram articulates and elaborates an intensely ethical and ecological form of animism grounded in the phenomenology of sensory experience  in his books  becoming animal  and  the spell of the sensuous   abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct experience  holding rather that perceived things actively  solicit our attention  or  call our focus   coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things  in the absence of intervening technologies  sensory experience is inherently animistic  disclosing a material field that is animate and self organizing from the get go  drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science  as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous  oral cultures  abram proposes a richly pluralist and story based cosmology  in which matter is alive through and through  such an ontology is in close accord  he suggests  with our spontaneous perceptual experience  it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more than human community of animals  plants  soils  mountains  waters and weather patterns that materially sustains us  in contrast to a long standing tendency in the western social sciences  which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience  abram develops an animistic account of reason itself  he holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs  indeed  as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen  these letters speak to us   we  see what they say    much as ancient trees and gushing streams and lichen encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors  hence reading is an intensely concentrated form of animism  one that effectively eclipses all of the other  older  more spontaneous forms of participation in which we once engaged   to tell the story in this manner   to provide an animistic account of reason  rather than the other way around   is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term  and that oral  mimetic modes of experience still underlie  and support  all our literate and technological modes of reflection  when reflection s rootedness in such bodily  participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious  reflective reason becomes dysfunctional  unintentionally destroying the corporeal  sensuous world that sustains it  

the religious studies scholar graham harvey defined animism as the belief  that the world is full of persons  only some of whom are human  and that life is always lived in relationship with others   he added that it is therefore  concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons  
graham harvey  in his      handbook of contemporary animism  identifies the animist perspective in line with martin buber s  i thou  as opposed to  i it   in such  harvey says  the animist takes an i thou approach to relating to his world  where objects and animals are treated as a  thou  rather than as an  it  

there is ongoing disagreement  and no general consensus  as to whether animism is merely a singular  broadly encompassing religious belief or a worldview in and of itself  comprising many diverse mythologies found worldwide in many diverse cultures  this also raises a controversy regarding the ethical claims animism may or may not make  whether animism ignores questions of ethics altogether or  by endowing various non human elements of nature with spirituality or personhood  in fact promotes a complex ecological ethics 

in many animistic world views  the human being is often regarded as on a roughly equal footing with other animals  plants  and natural forces 

a shaman is a person regarded as having access to  and influence in  the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits  who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual  and practices divination and healing  according to mircea eliade  shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds  shamans are said to treat ailments illness by mending the soul  alleviating traumas affecting the soul spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness  the shaman also enters supernatural realms or dimensions to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community  shamans may visit other worlds dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements  the shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world  which in turn affects the human world  the restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment  abram  however  articulates a less supernatural and much more ecological understanding of the shaman s role than that propounded by eliade  drawing upon his own field research in indonesia  nepal  and the americas  abram suggests that in animistic cultures  the shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more than human community of active agencies     the local animals  plants  and landforms  mountains  rivers  forests  winds and weather patterns  all of whom are felt to have their own specific sentience   hence the shaman s ability to heal individual instances of dis ease  or imbalance  within the human community is a by product of her his more continual practice of balancing the reciprocity between the human community and the wider collective of animate beings in which that community is embedded 

animism is not the same as pantheism  although the two are sometimes confused  some religions are both pantheistic and animistic  one of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature  they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united  monism   the way pantheists do  as a result  animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul  in pantheism  everything shares the same spiritual essence  rather than having distinct spirits and or souls 


animism entails the belief that  all living things have a soul   and thus a central concern of animist thought surrounds how animals can be eaten or otherwise used for humans  subsistence needs  the actions of non human animals are viewed as  intentional  planned and purposive   and they are understood to be persons because they are both alive and communicate with others  in animist world views  non human animals are understood to participate in kinship systems and ceremonies with humans  as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies  harvey cited an example of an animist understanding of animal behaviour that occurred at a powwow held by the conne river mi kmaq in       an eagle flew over the proceedings  circling over the central drum group  the assembled participants called out  kitpu    eagle    conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty  and they later articulated the view that the eagle s actions reflected its approval of the event and the mi kmaq s return to traditional spiritual practices 

some animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly  the most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former s collection of the latter for food  and for animists this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully  harvey cited the example of maori communities in new zealand  who often offer  karakia  invocations to sweet potatoes as they dig the latter up  while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the maori and the sweet potatoes  with both understood as having arrived in aotearoa together in the same canoes  in other instances  animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable  among some modern pagans  for instance  relationships are cultivated with specific trees  who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts  such as flowers  sap  or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a wand  in return  these pagans give offerings to the tree itself  which can come in the form of libations of mead or ale  a drop of blood from a finger  or a strand of wool 

various animistic cultures also comprehend as stones as persons  discussing ethnographic work conducted among the ojibwe  harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate  but with two notable exceptions  the stones of the bell rocks and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning  which were understood to have become thunderers themselves  the ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood  with storms being conceived of as persons known as  thunderers  whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests  throwing lightning at lake monsters  wind  similarly  can be conceived as a person in animistic thought 

the importance of place is also a recurring element of animism  with some places being understood to be persons in their own right 

animism can also entail relationships being established with non corporeal spirit entities 

in the early   th century  william mcdougall defended a form of animism in his book  body and mind  a history and defence of animism         

the physicist nick herbert has argued for  quantum animism  in which mind permeates the world at every level 

werner krieglstein wrote regarding his quantum animism 

ashley curtis has argued in  error and loss  a licence to enchantment  that the cartesian idea of an experiencing subject facing off with an inert physical world is incoherent at its very foundation  and that this incoherence is predicted rather than belied by darwinism  human reason  and its rigorous extension in the natural sciences  fits an evolutionary niche just as echolocation does for bats and infrared vision does for pit vipers  and is   according to western science s own dictates   epistemologically on a par with rather than superior to such capabilities  the meaning or aliveness of the  objects  we encounter   rocks  trees  rivers  other animals   thus depends for its validity not on a detached cognitive judgment but purely on the quality of our experience  the animist experience  and  indeed  the wolf s or raven s experience  thus become licenced as equally valid world views to the modern western scientific one   indeed  they are more valid  since they are not plagued with the incoherence that inevitably crops up when  objective existence  is separated from  subjective experience  

harvey opined that animism s views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of modernity  because it accords  intelligence  rationality  consciousness  volition  agency  intentionality  language and desire  to non humans  similarly  it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both abrahamic religions and western rationalism 

animist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork  for instance  among the maori communities of new zealand  there is an acknowledgment that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person  and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process  any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land  while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect  harvey therefore argued that the creation of art among the maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display  but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship 

harvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature  citing such examples as the writings of alan garner  leslie silko  barbara kingsolver  alice walker  daniel quinn  linda hogan  david abram  patricia grace  chinua achebe  ursula le guin  louise erdrich  and marge piercy  animist worldviews have also been identified in the animated films of hayao miyazaki 







antonio vivaldi

antonio lucio vivaldi      march              july       was an italian baroque musical composer  virtuoso violinist  teacher  and priest  born in venice  the capital of the venetian republic  he is regarded as one of the greatest baroque composers  and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across europe  he composed many instrumental concertos  for the violin and a variety of other instruments  as well as sacred choral works and more than forty operas  his best known work is a series of violin concertos known as the  four seasons  

many of his compositions were written for the all female music ensemble of the  ospedale della piet     a home for abandoned children  vivaldi had worked there as a catholic priest for years and was employed there from      to      and from      to       vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in venice  mantua and vienna  after meeting the emperor charles vi  vivaldi moved to vienna  hoping for royal support  however  the emperor died soon after vivaldi s arrival  and vivaldi himself died  in poverty  less than a year later 

antonio lucio vivaldi was born on   march      in venice  then the capital of the venetian republic  he was baptized immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife  which led to a belief that his life was somehow in danger  though the reasons for the child s immediate baptism are not known for certain  it was done most likely due either to his poor health or to an earthquake that shook the city that day  in the trauma of the earthquake  vivaldi s mother may have dedicated him to the priesthood  the ceremonies which had been omitted were supplied two months later 

vivaldi s parents were giovanni battista vivaldi and camilla calicchio  as recorded in the register of san giovanni in bragora  vivaldi had eight siblings  iseppo santo vivaldi  iseppo gaetano vivaldi  bonaventura tomaso vivaldi  margarita gabriela vivaldi  cecilia maria vivaldi  gerolama michela vivaldi  francesco gaetano vivaldi  and zanetta anna vivaldi  giovanni battista  who was a barber before becoming a professional violinist  taught antonio to play the violin and then toured venice playing the violin with his young son  antonio was probably taught at an early age  judging by the extensive musical knowledge he had acquired by the age of     when he started working at the ospedale della piet    giovanni battista was one of the founders of the  sovvegno dei musicisti di santa cecilia   an association of musicians 

the president of the  sovvegno  was giovanni legrenzi  an early baroque composer and the  maestro di cappella  at st mark s basilica  it is possible that legrenzi gave the young antonio his first lessons in composition  the luxembourg scholar walter kolneder has discerned the influence of legrenzi s style in vivaldi s early liturgical work  laetatus sum   rv anh      written in      at the age of thirteen  vivaldi s father may have been a composer himself  in       an opera titled  la fedelt   sfortunata  was composed by a giovanni battista rossi   the name under which vivaldi s father had joined the sovvegno di santa cecilia 

vivaldi s health was problematic  one of his symptoms   strettezza di petto    tightness of the chest    has been interpreted as a form of asthma  this did not prevent him from learning to play the violin  composing  or taking part in musical activities  although it did stop him from playing wind instruments  in       at the age of fifteen  he began studying to become a priest  he was ordained in       aged     and was soon nicknamed  il prete rosso    the red priest       is italian for  red   and would have referred to the color of his hair  a family trait  

not long after his ordination  in       he was given a dispensation from celebrating mass because of his ill health  vivaldi said mass as a priest only a few times  and appeared to have withdrawn from liturgical duties  though he formally remained a member of the priesthood  he remained committed to catholicism  to the extent that by old age  ernst ludwig gerber  writing in       considered him extraordinarily bigoted 

in september       vivaldi became  maestro di violino   master of violin  at an orphanage called the pio ospedale della piet    devout hospital of mercy  in venice  while vivaldi is most famous as a composer  he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well  the german architect johann friedrich armand von uffenbach referred to vivaldi as  the famous composer and violinist  and said that  vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently  and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy  an improvised cadenza  which absolutely astounded me  for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played  or ever will play  in such a fashion  
vivaldi was only    when he started working at the orphanage  over the next thirty years he composed most of his major works while working there  there were four similar institutions in venice  their purpose was to give shelter and education to children who were abandoned or orphaned  or whose families could not support them  they were financed by funds provided by the republic  the boys learned a trade and had to leave when they reached the age of fifteen  the girls received a musical education  and the most talented among them stayed and became members of the ospedale s renowned orchestra and choir 

shortly after vivaldi s appointment  the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad  too  vivaldi wrote concertos  cantatas and sacred vocal music for them  these sacred works  which number over     are varied  they included solo motets and large scale choral works for soloists  double chorus  and orchestra  in       the position of teacher of  viola all inglese  was added to his duties as violin instructor  the position of  maestro di coro   which was at one time filled by vivaldi  required a lot of time and work  he had to compose an oratorio or concerto at every feast and teach the orphans both music theory and how to play certain instruments 

his relationship with the board of directors of the ospedale was often strained  the board had to take a vote every year on whether to keep a teacher  the vote on vivaldi was seldom unanimous  and went   to   against him in       after a year as a freelance musician  he was recalled by the ospedale with a unanimous vote in       clearly during his year s absence the board had realized the importance of his role  he became responsible for all of the musical activity of the institution when he was promoted to  maestro de  concerti   music director  in      

in       the first collection   connor cassara   of his works was published by giuseppe sala  his opus   is a collection of    sonatas for two violins and basso continuo  in a conventional style  in       a second collection of    sonatas for violin and basso continuo appeared   opus    a real breakthrough as a composer came with his first collection of    concerti for one  two  and four violins with strings   l estro armonico   opus     which was published in amsterdam in      by estienne roger  dedicated to grand prince ferdinand of tuscany  the prince sponsored many musicians including alessandro scarlatti and george frideric handel  he was a musician himself  and vivaldi probably met him in venice   l estro armonico  was a resounding success all over europe  it was followed in      by  la stravaganza   opus     a collection of concerti for solo violin and strings  dedicated to an old violin student of vivaldi s  the venetian noble vettor dolfin 

in february       vivaldi and his father traveled to brescia  where his setting of the stabat mater  rv      was played as part of a religious festival  the work seems to have been written in haste  the string parts are simple  the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three  and not all the text is set  nevertheless  perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music  the work is considered to be one of his early masterpieces 

despite his frequent travels from       the ospedale paid him   sequins to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in venice  the orphanage s records show that he was paid for     concerti between      and      

in early   th century venice  opera was the most popular musical entertainment  it proved most profitable for vivaldi  there were several theaters competing for the public s attention  vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline  his first opera   ottone in villa   rv      was performed not in venice  but at the garzerie theater in vicenza in       the following year  vivaldi became the impresario of the teatro san angelo in venice  where his opera  orlando finto pazzo   rv      was performed  the work was not to the public s taste  and it closed after a couple of weeks  being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year 

in       he presented  nerone fatto cesare   rv      now lost   with music by seven different composers  of which he was the leader  the opera contained eleven arias  and was a success  in the late season  vivaldi planned to put on an opera entirely of his own creation   arsilda  regina di ponto   rv       but the state censor blocked the performance  the main character  arsilda  falls in love with another woman  lisea  who is pretending to be a man  vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year  and it was a resounding success 

during this period  the  piet    commissioned several liturgical works  the most important were two oratorios   moyses deus pharaonis    rv      is now lost  the second   juditha triumphans   rv       celebrates the victory of the republic of venice against the turks and the recapture of the island of corfu  composed in       it is one of his sacred masterpieces  all eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the orphanage  both the female and male roles  many of the arias include parts for solo instruments   recorders  oboes  violas d amore  and mandolins   that showcased the range of talents of the girls 

also in       vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas   l incoronazione di dario   rv      and  la costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi   rv       the latter was so popular that it performed two years later  re edited and retitled  artabano re dei parti   rv      now lost   it was also performed in prague in       in the years that followed  vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over italy 
his progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians such as benedetto marcello  a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a pamphlet denouncing vivaldi and his operas  the pamphlet   il teatro alla moda   attacks the composer even as it does not mention him directly  the cover drawing shows a boat  the sant angelo   on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest s hat and playing the violin  the marcello family claimed ownership of the teatro sant angelo  and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution  without success  the obscure text under the engraving mentions non existent places and names  for example   aldiviva  is an anagram of  a  vivaldi  

in a letter written by vivaldi to his patron marchese bentivoglio in       he makes reference to his     operas   only around    operas by vivaldi have been discovered  and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists  although vivaldi may have been exaggerating  it is plausible that  in his dual role of composer and  impresario   he may have either written or been responsible for the production of as many as    operas   given that his career had by then spanned almost    years  while vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time  he never attained the prominence of other great composers such as alessandro scarlatti  johann adolph hasse  leonardo leo  and baldassare galuppi  as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for an extended period of time in any major opera house 

in      or       vivaldi was offered a prestigious new position as  maestro di cappella  of the court of prince philip of hesse darmstadt  governor of mantua  in the northwest of italy  he moved there for three years and produced several operas  among them  tito manlio   rv       in       he was in milan  where he presented the pastoral drama  la silvia   rv       nine arias from it survive  he visited milan again the following year with the oratorio  l adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino ges     rv      now lost   in      he moved to rome  where he introduced his operas  new style  the new pope benedict xiii invited vivaldi to play for him  in       vivaldi returned to venice  where he produced four operas in the same year 

during this period vivaldi wrote the  four seasons   four violin concertos that give musical expression to the seasons of the year  though three of the concerti are wholly original  the first   spring   borrows motifs from a sinfonia in the first act of vivaldi s contemporaneous opera  il giustino   the inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around mantua  they were a revolution in musical conception  in them vivaldi represented flowing creeks  singing birds  of different species  each specifically characterized   barking dogs  buzzing mosquitoes  crying shepherds  storms  drunken dancers  silent nights  hunting parties from both the hunters  and the prey s point of view  frozen landscapes  ice skating children  and warming winter fires  each concerto is associated with a sonnet  possibly by vivaldi  describing the scenes depicted in the music  they were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve   il cimento dell armonia e dell inventione   opus    published in amsterdam by michel charles le c  ne in      

during his time in mantua  vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer anna tessieri gir    who would become his student  prot  g  e  and favorite  prima donna   anna  along with her older half sister paolina  became part of vivaldi s entourage and regularly accompanied him on his many travels  there was speculation as to the nature of vivaldi s and gir   s relationship  but no evidence exists to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration  vivaldi  in fact  adamantly denied any romantic relationship with gir   in a letter to his patron bentivoglio dated    november      

at the height of his career  vivaldi received commissions from european nobility and royalty  the  serenata   cantata   gloria e imeneo   rv      was commissioned in      by the french ambassador to venice in celebration of the marriage of louis xv  the following year  another  serenata    la sena festeggiante   rv       was written for and premiered at the french embassy as well  celebrating the birth of the french royal princesses  henriette and louise   lisabeth  vivaldi s opus     la cetra   was dedicated to emperor charles vi  in       vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting trieste to oversee the construction of a new port  charles admired the music of the red priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years  he gave vivaldi the title of knight  a gold medal and an invitation to vienna  vivaldi gave charles a manuscript copy of  la cetra   a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as opus    the printing was probably delayed  forcing vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor 

accompanied by his father  vivaldi traveled to vienna and prague in       where his opera  farnace   rv      was presented  it garnered six revivals  some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of italy s major writers of the time   l olimpiade  and  catone in utica  were written by pietro metastasio  the major representative of the arcadian movement and court poet in vienna   la griselda  was rewritten by the young carlo goldoni from an earlier libretto by apostolo zeno 

like many composers of the time  vivaldi faced financial difficulties in his later years  his compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once had been in venice  changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded  in response  vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to vienna  the reasons for vivaldi s departure from venice are unclear  but it seems likely that  after the success of his meeting with emperor charles vi  he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court  on his way to vienna  vivaldi may have stopped in graz to see anna gir   

it is also likely that vivaldi went to vienna to stage operas  especially as he took up residence near the k  rntnertortheater  shortly after his arrival in vienna  charles vi died  which left the composer without any royal protection or a steady source of income  soon afterwards  vivaldi became impoverished and died during the night of       july       aged     of  internal infection   in a house owned by the widow of a viennese saddlemaker  on    july  vivaldi was buried in a simple grave in a burial ground that was owned by the public hospital fund  his funeral took place at st  stephen s cathedral  contrary to popular legend  the young joseph haydn had nothing to do with his burial  since no music was performed on that occasion  the cost of his funeral with a  kleingel  ut  was    gulden    kreuzer which was rather expensive for the lowest class of peal of bells 

vivaldi was buried next to karlskirche  a baroque church in an area which is now part of the site of the tu wien  the house where he lived in vienna has since been destroyed  the hotel sacher is built on part of the site  memorial plaques have been placed at both locations  as well as a vivaldi  star  in the viennese musikmeile and a monument at the rooseveltplatz 

only two  possibly three original portraits of vivaldi are known to survive  an engraving  an ink sketch and an oil painting  the engraving  which was the basis of several copies produced later by other artists  was made in      by fran  ois morellon la cave for the first edition of  il cimento dell armonia e dell inventione   and shows vivaldi holding a sheet of music  the ink sketch  a caricature  was done by ghezzi in      and shows vivaldi s head and shoulders in profile  it exists in two versions  a first jotting kept at the vatican library  and a much lesser known  slightly more detailed copy recently discovered in moscow  the oil painting  which can be seen in the international museum and library of music of bologna  is anonymous and is thought to depict vivaldi due to its strong resemblance to the la cave engraving 

vivaldi s music was innovative  he brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto  in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes  many of his compositions are flamboyantly  almost playfully  exuberant 

johann sebastian bach was deeply influenced by vivaldi s concertos and arias  recalled in his  st john passion    st matthew passion   and cantatas   bach transcribed six of vivaldi s concerti for solo keyboard  three for organ  and one for four harpsichords  strings  and basso continuo  bwv       based upon the concerto for four violins  two violas  cello  and basso continuo  rv      

during his lifetime  vivaldi was popular in many countries throughout europe  including france  but after his death his popularity dwindled  after the end of baroque period  vivaldi s published concerti became relatively unknown  and were largely ignored  even his most famous work  the  four seasons   was unknown in its original edition during the classical and romantic periods 

in the early   th century  fritz kreisler s concerto in c  in the style of vivaldi  which he passed off as an original vivaldi work  helped revive vivaldi s reputation  this spurred the french scholar marc pincherle to begin an academic study of vivaldi s oeuvre  many vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered  which were acquired by the turin national university library as a result of the generous sponsorship of turinese businessmen roberto foa and filippo giordano  in memory of their sons  this led to a renewed interest in vivaldi by  among others  mario rinaldi  alfredo casella  ezra pound  olga rudge  desmond chute  arturo toscanini  arnold schering and louis kaufman  all of whom were instrumental in the revival of vivaldi throughout the   th century 

in       in a monastery in piedmont  researchers discovered fourteen folios of vivaldi s work that were previously thought to have been lost during the napoleonic wars  some missing volumes in the numbered set were discovered in the collections of the descendants of the grand duke durazzo  who had acquired the monastery complex in the   th century  the volumes contained     concertos     operas and over     vocal instrumental works 

the resurrection of vivaldi s unpublished works in the   th century is mostly due to the efforts of alfredo casella  who in      organized the historic vivaldi week  in which the rediscovered gloria  rv      and l olimpiade were revived  since world war ii  vivaldi s compositions have enjoyed wide success  historically informed performances  often on  original instruments   have increased vivaldi s fame still further 

recent rediscoveries of works by vivaldi include two psalm settings of  nisi dominus   rv      in eight movements  and dixit dominus  rv      in eleven movements   these were identified in      and      respectively  by the australian scholar janice stockigt  the vivaldi scholar michael talbot described rv     as  arguably the best nonoperatic work from vivaldi s pen to come to light since       the     s   vivaldi s      opera  argippo   rv       which had been considered lost  was rediscovered in      by the harpsichordist and conductor ond  ej macek  whose hofmusici orchestra performed the work at prague castle on   may        its first performance since      

a composition by vivaldi is identified by rv number  which refers to its place in the  ryom verzeichnis  or  r  pertoire des oeuvres d antonio vivaldi   a catalog created in the   th century by the musicologist peter ryom 

 le quattro stagioni   the four seasons  of      is his most famous work  part of  il cimento dell armonia e dell inventione    the contest between harmony and invention    it depicts moods and scenes from each of the four seasons  this work has been described as an outstanding instance of pre   th century program music 

vivaldi wrote more than     other concertos  about     of these are for solo instrument and strings  of which     are for violin  the others being for bassoon  cello  oboe  flute  viola d amore  recorder  lute  or mandolin  about forty concertos are for two instruments and strings  and about thirty are for three or more instruments and strings 

as well as about    operas  vivaldi composed a large body of sacred choral music  other works include sinfonias  about    sonatas and chamber music 

some sonatas for flute  published as  il pastor fido   have been erroneously attributed to vivaldi  but were composed by nicolas ch  deville 

vivaldi s works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer  scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries which made old catalogs incomplete  works still in circulation today may be numbered under several different systems  some earlier catalogs are mentioned here  

because the simply consecutive complete edition  ce  numbers did not reflect the individual works  opus numbers  into which compositions were grouped  fanna numbers were often used in conjunction with ce numbers  combined complete edition  ce  fanna numbering was especially common in the work of italian groups driving the mid   th century revival of vivaldi  such as gli accademici di milano under piero santi  for example  the bassoon concerto in b major   la notte  rv      became ce     f  viii  

despite the awkwardness of having to overlay fanna numbers onto the complete edition number for meaningful grouping of vivaldi s oeuvre  these numbers displaced the older pincherle numbers as the  re  discovery of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete 

this cataloging work was led by the istituto italiano antonio vivaldi  where gian francesco malipiero was both the director and the editor of the published scores  edizioni g  ricordi   his work built on that of antonio fanna  a venetian businessman and the institute s founder  and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today 

compositions by vivaldi are identified today by rv number  the number assigned by danish musicologist peter ryom in works published mostly in the     s  such as the  ryom verzeichnis  or  r  pertoire des oeuvres d antonio vivaldi   like the complete edition before it  the rv does not typically assign its single  consecutive numbers to  adjacent  works that occupy one of the composer s single opus numbers  its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works 

the movie    was completed in      as an italian french co production under the direction of jean louis guillermou  in       abc radio national commissioned a radio play about vivaldi  which was written by sean riley  entitled  the angel and the red priest   the play was later adapted for the stage and was performed at the adelaide festival of the arts 

janice jordan shefelman wrote a children s book detailing the life of vivaldi entitled  i  vivaldi  

classical kids music education produces live theatre productions  and has issued a cd entitled  vivaldi s ring of mystery   it is an original story about an orphan girl in the early     s who goes in search of her roots  a central clue to the mystery is a missing stradivarius violin that the duke of cremona has brought to vivaldi s school of the  piet    in the hopes of finding his long lost grandchild  vivaldi s music is featured throughout the story 






adrian

adrian is a form of the latin given name  adrianus  or  hadrianus   its ultimate origin is most likely via the former river adria from the venetic and illyrian word  adur   meaning  sea  or  water   the adria was until the  th century bc the main channel of the po river into the adriatic sea but ceased to exist before the  st century bc  hecataeus of miletus  c       c     bc  asserted that both the etruscan harbor city of adria and the adriatic sea had been named after it  emperor hadrian s family was named after the city or region of adria hadria  now atri  in picenum  which most likely started as an etruscan or greek colony of the older harbor city of the same name  

several saints and six popes have borne this name  including the only english pope  adrian iv  and the only dutch pope  adrian vi  as an english name  it has been in use since the middle ages  although it did not become common until modern times 











aare

the aare    or aar is a tributary of the high rhine and the longest river that both rises and ends entirely within switzerland 

its total length from its source to its junction with the rhine comprises about   during which distance it descends   draining an area of   almost entirely within switzerland  and accounting for close to half the area of the country  including all of central switzerland 

there are more than    hydroelectric plants along the course of the aare river 

the river s name dates to at least the la t  ne period  and it is attested as  nantaror   aare valley  in the berne zinc tablet 

the name was latinized as  arula   arola   araris  

the aare rises in the great aargletschers  aare glaciers  of the bernese alps  in the canton of bern and west of the grimsel pass  the finsteraargletscher and lauteraargletscher come together to form the unteraargletscher  lower aar glacier   which is the main source of water for the grimselsee  lake of grimsel   the oberaargletscher  upper aar glacier  feeds the oberaarsee  which also flows into the grimselsee  the aare leaves the grimselsee just to the east to the grimsel hospiz  below the grimsel pass  and then flows northwest through the haslital  forming on the way the magnificent handegg waterfall    past guttannen 

right after innertkirchen it is joined by its first major tributary  the gamderwasser  less than later the river carves through a limestone ridge in the aare gorge     it is here that the aare proves itself to be more than just a river  as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge  a little past meiringen  near brienz  the river expands into lake brienz  near the west end of the lake it indirectly receives its first important tributary  the l  tschine  by the lake of brienz  it then runs across the swampy plain of the b  deli  swiss german diminutive for ground  between interlaken and unterseen before flowing into lake thun 

near the west end of lake thun  the river indirectly receives the waters of the kander  which has just been joined by the simme  by the lake of thun  lake thun marks the head of navigation  on flowing out of the lake it passes through thun  and then flows through the city of bern  passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply flanked peninsula on which the old city of berne is located  the river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction  but after receiving the saane or la sarine it turns north until it nears aarberg  there  in one of the major swiss engineering feats of the   th century  the jura water correction  the river  which had previously rendered the countryside north of bern a swampland through frequent flooding  was diverted by the aare hagneck canal into the lac de bienne  from the upper end of the lake  at nidau  the river issues through the nidau b  ren canal  also called the aare canal  and then runs east to b  ren  the lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the alps  and the former swamps have become fruitful plains  they are known as the  vegetable garden of switzerland  

from here the aare flows northeast for a long distance  past the ambassador town solothurn  below which the grosse emme flows in on the right   aarburg  where it is joined by the wigger   olten  aarau  near which is the junction with the suhre  and wildegg  where the seetal aabach falls in on the right  a short distance further  below brugg it receives first the reuss  its major tributary  and shortly afterwards the limmat  its second strongest tributary  it now turns to north  and soon becomes itself a tributary of the rhine  which it even surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite downstream from koblenz  switzerland   opposite waldshut in germany  the rhine  in turn  empties into the north sea after crossing into the netherlands 








abbotsford house

abbotsford is a historic country house in the scottish borders  near melrose  on the south bank of the river tweed  it was formerly the residence of historical novelist and poet  sir walter scott  it is a category a listed building 

the nucleus of the estate was a small farm of   called cartleyhole  nicknamed clarty  i e   muddy  hole  and was bought by scott on the lapse of his lease        of the neighbouring house of ashestiel  

he first built a small villa and named it abbotsford  creating the name from a ford nearby where previously abbots of melrose abbey used to cross the river  scott then built additions to the house and made it into a mansion  building into the walls many sculptured stones from ruined castles and abbeys of scotland  in it he gathered a large library  a collection of ancient furniture  arms and armour  and other relics and curiosities  especially connected with scottish history  notably the celtic torrs pony cap and horns and the woodwrae stone  all now in the museum of scotland 

the last and principal acquisition was that of toftfield  afterwards named huntlyburn   purchased in       the new house was then begun and completed in      

the general ground plan is a parallelogram  with irregular outlines  one side overlooking the tweed  and the style is mainly the scottish baronial  the estate is recognized as a highly influential creation for the scottish baronial style with themes from abbotsford being reflected across many buildings in the scottish borders  the manor as a whole appears as a  castle in miniature   with small towers and imitation battlements decorating the house and garden walls  into various parts of the fabric were built relics and curiosities from historical structures  such as the doorway of the old tolbooth in edinburgh  scott collected many of these curiosities to be built into the walls of the south garden  which previously hosted a colonnade of gothic arches along the garden walls  along the path of the former colonnade sits the remains of edinburgh s   th century mercat cross and several examples of classical sculpture 

the estate and its neo medieval features nod towards scott s desire for a historical feel  but the writer ensured that the house would provide all the comforts of modern living  as a result  scott used the space as a proving ground for new technologies  the house was outfitted with early gas lighting and pneumatic bells connecting residents with servants elsewhere in the house 

scott had only enjoyed his residence one year when        he met with that reverse of fortune which involved the estate in debt  in       the library and museum were presented to him as a free gift by the creditors  the property was wholly disencumbered in      by robert cadell  the publisher  who cancelled the bond upon it in exchange for the family s share in the copyright of sir walter s works  

scott s only son walter did not live to enjoy the property  having died on his way from india in       among subsequent possessors were scott s son in law  john gibson lockhart  j  r  hope scott  qc  and his daughter  scott s great granddaughter   the hon  mrs maxwell scott 
the house was opened to the public in       but continued to be occupied by scott s descendants until       the last of his direct descendants to hold the lairdship of abbotsford was his great great great granddaughter dame jean maxwell scott    june            may        she inherited it from her elder sister patricia maxwell scott in       the sisters turned the house into one of scotland s premier tourist attractions  after they had to rely on paying visitors to afford the upkeep of the house  it had electricity installed only in       

dame jean was at one time a lady in waiting to princess alice  duchess of gloucester  patron of the dandie dinmont club  a breed of dog named after one of sir walter scott s characters  and a horse trainer  one of whose horses  sir wattie  ridden by ian stark  won two silver medals at the      summer olympics 

in       scottish borders council was considering an application by a property developer to build a housing estate on the opposite bank of the river tweed from abbotsford  to which historic scotland and the national trust for scotland objected 

sir walter scott rescued the  jougs  from threave castle in dumfries and galloway and attached them to the castellated gateway he built at abbotsford 

tweedbank railway station is located near to abbotsford house 

abbotsford gave its name to the abbotsford club  founded by william barclay turnbull in      or      in scott s honour  and a successor to the bannatyne and maitland clubs  it was a text publication society  which existed to print and publish historical works connected with scott s writings  its publications extended from      to      

in       a new visitor centre opened at abbotsford which houses a small exhibition  gift shop and ochiltree s dining  a caf   restaurant with views over the house and grounds 

in      it won the european union prize for cultural heritage   europa nostra award for its recent conservation project

abraham

abraham  originally abram  is the common patriarch of the three abrahamic religions 
in judaism  he is the founding father of the covenant  the special relationship between the jewish people and god  in christianity  he is the prototype of all believers  jewish or gentile  and in islam he is seen as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with adam and culminates in muhammad 

the narrative in genesis revolves around the themes of posterity and land  abraham is called by god to leave the house of his father terah and settle in the land originally given to canaan but which god now promises to abraham and his progeny  various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after abraham  and  while promises are made to ishmael about founding a great nation  isaac  abraham s son by his half sister sarah  inherits god s promises to abraham  abraham purchases a tomb  the cave of the patriarchs  at hebron to be sarah s grave  thus establishing his right to the land  and  in the second generation  his heir isaac is married to a woman from his own kin  thus ruling the canaanites out of any inheritance  abraham later marries keturah and has six more sons  but  on his death  when he is buried beside sarah  it is isaac who receives  all abraham s goods   while the other sons receive only  gifts   genesis           

the abraham story cannot be definitively related to any specific time  and it is widely agreed that the patriarchal age  along with the exodus and the period of the judges  is a late literary construct that does not relate to any period in actual history  a common hypothesis among scholars is that it was composed in the early persian period  late  th century bce  as a result of tensions between jewish landowners who had stayed in judah during the babylonian captivity and traced their right to the land through their  father abraham   and the returning exiles who based their counter claim on moses and the exodus tradition 

terah  the ninth in descent from noah  was the father of three sons  abram  nahor  and haran  in his youth  abram worked in terah s idol shop  haran was the father of lot  and thus lot was abram s nephew  haran died in his native city  ur of the chaldees 

abram married sarah  sarai   who was barren  terah  with abram  sarai  and lot  then departed for canaan  but settled in a place named haran  where terah died at the age of      god had told abram to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him  and promised to make of him a great nation  bless him  make his name great  bless them that bless him  and curse them who may curse him  abram was    years old when he left haran with his wife sarai  his nephew lot  and the substance and souls that they had acquired  and traveled to shechem in canaan 

there was a severe famine in the land of canaan  so that abram and lot and their households  traveled to egypt  on the way abram told sarai to say that she was his sister  so that the egyptians would not kill him  when they entered egypt  the pharaoh s officials praised sarai s beauty to pharaoh  and they took her into the palace and gave abram goods in exchange  god afflicted pharaoh and his household with plagues  which led pharaoh to try to find out what was wrong  upon discovering that sarai was a married woman  pharaoh demanded that abram and sarai leave 

when they came back to the bethel and hai area  abram s and lot s sizable herds occupied the same pastures  this became a problem for the herdsmen who were assigned to each family s cattle  the conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that abram suggested that lot choose a separate area  either on the left hand or on the right hand  that there be no conflict amongst brethren  lot chose to go eastward to the plain of jordan where the land was well watered everywhere as far as zoar  and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward sodom  abram went south to hebron and settled in the plain of mamre  where he built another altar to worship god 

during the rebellion of the jordan river cities against elam  abram s nephew  lot  was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading elamite forces  the elamite army came to collect the spoils of war  after having just defeated the king of sodom s armies  lot and his family  at the time  were settled on the outskirts of the kingdom of sodom which made them a visible target 

one person who escaped capture came and told abram what happened  once abram received this news  he immediately assembled     trained servants  abram s force headed north in pursuit of the elamite army  who were already worn down from the battle of siddim  when they caught up with them at dan  abram devised a battle plan by splitting his group into more than one unit  and launched a night raid  not only were they able to free the captives  abram s unit chased and slaughtered the elamite king chedorlaomer at hobah  just north of damascus  they freed lot  as well as his household and possessions  and recovered all of the goods from sodom that had been taken 

upon abram s return  sodom s king came out to meet with him in the valley of shaveh  the  king s dale   also  melchizedek king of salem  jerusalem   a priest of god most high  brought out bread and wine and blessed abram and god  abram then gave melchizedek a tenth of everything  the king of sodom then offered to let abram keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people  abram refused any deal from the king of sodom  other than the share to which his allies were entitled 

the voice of the lord came to abram in a vision and repeated the promise of the land and descendants as numerous as the stars  abram and god made a covenant ceremony  and god told of the future bondage of israel in egypt  god described to abram the land that his offspring would claim  the land of the kenites  kenizzites  kadmonites  hittites  perizzites  rephaims  amorites  canaanites  girgashites  and jebusites 

abram and sarai tried to make sense of how he would become a progenitor of nations  because after    years of living in canaan  no child had been born  sarai then offered her egyptian handmaiden  hagar  to abram with the intention that she would bear him a son 

after hagar found she was pregnant  she began to despise her mistress  sarai  sarai responded by mistreating hagar  and hagar fled into the wilderness  an angel spoke with hagar at the fountain on the way to shur  he instructed her to return to the camp of abram  and that her son would be  a wild ass of a man  his hand shall be against every man  and every man s hand against him  and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren   she was told to call her son ishmael  hagar then called god who spoke to her  el roi     thou god seest me   kjv   from that day onward  the well was called beer lahai roi    the well of him that liveth and seeth me   kjv margin   she then did as she was instructed by returning to her mistress in order to have her child  abram was    years of age when ishmael was born 

thirteen years later  when abram was    years of age  god declared abram s new name   abraham        a father of many nations   abraham then received the instructions for the covenant  of which circumcision was to be the sign 

god declared sarai s new name   sarah   blessed her  and told abraham   i will give thee a son also of her   abraham laughed  and  said in his heart   shall a  child  be born unto him that is a hundred years old  and shall sarah  that is ninety years old  bear    immediately after abraham s encounter with god  he had his entire household of men  including himself  age     and ishmael  age      circumcised 

not long afterward  during the heat of the day  abraham had been sitting at the entrance of his tent by the terebinths of mamre  he looked up and saw three men in the presence of god  then he ran and bowed to the ground to welcome them  abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread  to which they assented  abraham rushed to sarah s tent to order cakes made from choice flour  then he ordered a servant boy to prepare a choice calf  when all was prepared  he set curds  milk and the calf before them  waiting on them  under a tree  as they ate 

one of the visitors told abraham that upon his return next year  sarah would have a son  while at the tent entrance  sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages  the visitor inquired of abraham why sarah laughed at bearing a child at her age  as nothing is too hard for god  frightened  sarah denied laughing 

after eating  abraham and the three visitors got up  they walked over to the peak that overlooked the  cities of the plain  to discuss the fate of sodom and gomorrah for their detestable sins that were so great  it moved god to action  because abraham s nephew was living in sodom  god revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities  at this point  the two other visitors left for sodom  then abraham turned to god and pleaded decrementally with him  from fifty persons to less  that  if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city  would not god spare the city   for the sake of ten righteous people  god declared that he would not destroy the city 

when the two visitors got to sodom to conduct their report  they planned on staying in the city square  however  abraham s nephew  lot  met with them and strongly insisted that these two  men  stay at his house for the night  a rally of men stood outside of lot s home and demanded that they bring out his guests so that they may  know   v    them  however  lot objected and offered his virgin daughters who had not  known   v    man to the rally of men instead  they rejected that notion and sought to break down lot s door to get to his male guests  thus confirming the wickedness of the city and portending their imminent destruction 

early the next morning  abraham went to the place where he stood before god  he  looked out toward sodom and gomorrah  and saw what became of the cities of the plain  where not even  ten righteous   v        had been found  as  the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace  

abraham settled between kadesh and shur in the land of the philistines  while he was living in gerar  abraham openly claimed that sarah was his sister  upon discovering this news  king abimelech had her brought to him  god then came to abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a man s wife  abimelech had not laid hands on her  so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation  especially since abraham had claimed that he and sarah were siblings  in response  god told abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist  however  should he not return the wife of abraham back to him  god would surely destroy abimelech and his entire household  abimelech was informed that abraham was a prophet who would pray for him 

early next morning  abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom  abraham stated that he thought there was no fear of god in that place  and that they might kill him for his wife  then abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all   and yet indeed  she is  my sister  she  is  the daughter of my father  but not the daughter of my mother  and she became my wife   abimelech returned sarah to abraham  and gave him gifts of sheep  oxen  and servants  and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in abimelech s lands  further  abimelech gave abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as sarah s vindication before all  abraham then prayed for abimelech and his household  since god had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of sarah 

after living for some time in the land of the philistines  abimelech and phicol  the chief of his troops  approached abraham because of a dispute that resulted in a violent confrontation at a well  abraham then reproached abimelech due to his philistine servant s aggressive attacks and the seizing of abraham s well  abimelech claimed ignorance of the incident  then abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to abimelech  further  to attest that abraham was the one who dug the well  he also gave abimelech seven ewes for proof  because of this sworn oath  they called the place of this well  beersheba  after abimelech and phicol headed back to philistia  abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called upon  the name of the   the everlasting god  

as had been prophesied in mamre the previous year  sarah became pregnant and bore a son to abraham  on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision  abraham was  an hundred years old   when his son whom he named isaac was born  and he circumcised him when he was eight days old  for sarah  the thought of giving birth and nursing a child  at such an old age  also brought her much laughter  as she declared   god hath made me to laugh  so that all that hear will laugh with me   isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned  abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion  during the celebration  however  sarah found ishmael mocking  an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of isaac 

ishmael was fourteen years old when abraham s son isaac was born to sarah  when she found ishmael teasing isaac  sarah told abraham to send both ishmael and hagar away  she declared that ishmael would not share in isaac s inheritance  abraham was greatly distressed by his wife s words and sought the advice of his god  god told abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded  god reassured abraham that  in isaac shall seed be called to thee   he also said that ishmael would make a nation   because he is thy seed  

early the next morning  abraham brought hagar and ishmael out together  he gave her bread and water and sent them away  the two wandered in the wilderness of beersheba until her bottle of water was completely consumed  in a moment of despair  she burst into tears  after god heard the boy s voice  an angel of the lord confirmed to hagar that he would become a great nation  and will be  living on his sword   a well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives  as the boy grew  he became a skilled archer living in the wilderness of paran  eventually his mother found a wife for ishmael from her home country  the land of egypt 

at some point in isaac s youth  abraham was commanded by god to offer his son up as a sacrifice in the land of moriah  the patriarch traveled three days until he came to the mount that god told him of  he then commanded the servants to remain while he and isaac proceeded alone into the mount  isaac carried the wood upon which he would be sacrificed  along the way  isaac asked his father where the animal for the burnt offering was  to which abraham replied  god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering   just as abraham was about to sacrifice his son  he was interrupted by the angel of the lord  and he saw behind him a  ram caught in a thicket by his horns   which he sacrificed instead of his son  for his obedience he received another promise of numerous descendants and abundant prosperity  after this event  abraham went to beersheba 

sarah died  and abraham buried her in the cave of the patriarchs  the  cave of machpelah    near hebron which he had purchased along with the adjoining field from ephron the hittite  after the death of sarah  abraham took another wife  a concubine named keturah  by whom he had six sons  zimran  jokshan  medan  midian  ishbak  and shuah  according to the bible  reflecting the change of his name to  abraham  meaning  a father of many nations   abraham is considered to be the progenitor of many nations mentioned in the bible  among others the israelites  ishmaelites  edomites   amalekites  kenizzites  midianites and assyrians  and through his nephew lot he was also related to the moabites and ammonites  abraham lived to see his son marry rebekah   and to see the birth of his twin grandsons jacob and esau   he died at age      and was buried in the cave of machpelah by his sons isaac and ishmael 

in the early and middle   th century  leading archaeologists such as william f  albright and biblical scholars such as albrecht alt believed that the patriarchs and matriarchs were either real individuals or believable composites of people who lived in the  patriarchal age   the  nd millennium bce  but  in the     s  new arguments concerning israel s past and the biblical texts challenged these views  these arguments can be found in thomas l  thompson s  the historicity of the patriarchal narratives          and john van seters   abraham in history and tradition          thompson  a literary scholar  based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts  his thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the  nd millennium bce  and noted how certain biblical texts reflected first millennium conditions and concerns  van seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names  social milieu  and messages strongly suggested that they were iron age creations  by the beginning of the   st century  archaeologists had given up hope of recovering any context that would make abraham  isaac or jacob credible historical figures 

abraham s name is apparently very ancient  as the tradition found in genesis no longer understands its original meaning  probably  father is exalted      the meaning offered in genesis        father of a multitude   is a popular etymology   the story  like those of the other patriarchs  most likely had a substantial oral prehistory  at some stage the oral traditions became part of the written tradition of the pentateuch  a majority of scholars believe this stage belongs to the persian period  roughly           bce  the mechanisms by which this came about remain unknown  but there are currently two important hypotheses  the first  called persian imperial authorisation  is that the post exilic community devised the torah as a legal basis on which to function within the persian imperial system  the second is that pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for who would belong to the post exilic jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups  notably the priesthood and the lay  elders  

nevertheless  the completion of the torah and its elevation to the centre of post exilic judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones     the final pentateuch was based on existing traditions  in ezekiel   written during the exile  i e   in the first half of the  th century bce   ezekiel  an exile in babylon  tells how those who remained in judah are claiming ownership of the land based on inheritance from abraham  but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they do not observe torah  isaiah similarly testifies of tension between the people of judah and the returning post exilic jews  the  g  l      stating that god is the father of israel and that israel s history begins with the exodus and not with abraham  the conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence  e g   ezra nehemiah   is that the figure of abraham must have been preeminent among the great landowners of judah at the time of the exile and after  serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles 

abraham is given a high position of respect in three major world faiths  judaism  christianity and islam  in judaism he is the founding father of the covenant  the special relationship between the jewish people and god      a belief which gives the jews a unique position as the chosen people of god  in christianity  the apostle paul taught that abraham s faith in god     preceding the mosaic law     made him the prototype of all believers  circumcised and uncircumcised  the islamic prophet muhammad claimed abraham  whose submission to god constituted  islam  as a  believer before the fact  and undercut jewish claims to an exclusive relationship with god and the covenant 

in jewish tradition  abraham is called  avraham avinu                            our father abraham   signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the jews and the father of judaism  the first jew  his story is read in the weekly torah reading portions  predominantly in the parashot  lech lecha                      vayeira                     chayei sarah                              and toledot                      

in jewish legend  god created heaven and earth for the sake of the merits of abraham  after the deluge  abraham was the only one among the pious who solemnly swear never forsaking god  and studied in house of noah and shem to learn about  ways of god   and continuing the line of high priest from noah and shem  then he descended the office to levi and his seed forever  before leaving his fathers  land  abraham was miraculously saved from the fiery furnace of nimrod following his brave action of breaking the idols of the chaldeans into pieces  during his sojourning in canaan  abraham was accustomed to extend hospitality to travelers and strangers and taught how to praise god also knowledge of god to those who had received his kindness 

besides isaac and jacob  he is the one whose name would appear united with god  as god in judaism was called  elohei abraham  elohei yitzchaq ve elohei ya aqob    god of abraham  god of isaac  and god of jacob   and never the god of any one else  he was also mentioned as the father of thirty nations 

abraham does not loom so large in christianity as he does in judaism and islam  it is jesus as the jewish messiah who is central to christianity  and the idea of a divine messiah is what separates christianity from the other two religions  in romans    abraham s merit is less his obedience to the divine will than his faith in god s ultimate grace  this faith provides him the merit for god having chosen him for the covenant  and the covenant becomes one of faith  not obedience 

the roman catholic church calls abraham  our father in faith  in the eucharistic prayer of the roman canon  recited during the mass  see  abraham in the catholic liturgy    he is also commemorated in the calendars of saints of several denominations  on    august by the maronite church     august in the coptic church and the assyrian church of the east  with the full office for the latter   and on   october by the roman catholic church and the lutheran church   missouri synod  in the introduction to his   th century translation of the golden legend s account of abraham  william caxton noted that this patriarch s life was read in church on quinquagesima sunday 
he is the patron saint of those in the hospitality industry  the eastern orthodox church commemorates him as the  righteous forefather abraham   with two feast days in its liturgical calendar  the first time is on   october  for those churches which follow the traditional julian calendar    october falls on    october of the modern gregorian calendar   where he is commemorated together with his nephew  righteous lot   the other is on the  sunday of the forefathers   two sundays before christmas   when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of jesus  abraham is also mentioned in the divine liturgy of saint basil the great  just before the anaphora  and abraham and sarah are invoked in the prayers said by the priest over a newly married couple 

islam regards abraham as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with adam and culminates in muhammad 
ibr  h  m is mentioned in    chapters of the quran  more often than any other biblical personage apart from moses  he is called both a  hanif   monotheist  and  muslim   one who submits   and muslims regard him as a prophet and patriarch  the archetype of the perfect muslim  and the revered reformer of the kaaba in mecca  islamic traditions consider ibr  h  m  abraham  the first pioneer of islam  which is also called  millat ibrahim   the  religion of abraham    and that his purpose and mission throughout his life was to proclaim the oneness of god  in islam  abraham holds an exalted position among the major prophets and he is referred to as  ibrahim khalilullah   meaning  abraham the beloved of allah  

besides ishaq and yaqub  ibrahim is among the most honorable and the most excellent men in sight of god  ibrahim was also mentioned in quran as  father of muslims  and the role model for the community 

paintings on the life of abraham tend to focus on only a few incidents  the sacrifice of isaac  meeting melchizedek  entertaining the three angels  hagar in the desert  and a few others  additionally  martin o kane  a professor of biblical studies  writes that the parable of lazarus resting in the  bosom of abraham   as described in the gospel of luke  became an iconic image in christian works  according to o kane  artists often chose to divert from the common literary portrayal of lazarus sitting next to abraham at a banquet in heaven and instead focus on the  somewhat incongruous notion of abraham  the most venerated of patriarchs  holding a naked and vulnerable child in his bosom   several artists have been inspired by the life of abraham  including albrecht d  rer                caravaggio                donatello  raphael  philip van dyck  dutch painter                and claude lorrain  french painter                rembrandt  dutch               created at least seven works on abraham  peter paul rubens               did several  marc chagall did at least five on abraham  gustave dor    french illustrator               did six  and james tissot  french painter and illustrator               did over twenty works on the subject 
the sarcophagus of junius bassus depicts a set of biblical stories  including abraham about to sacrifice isaac  these sculpted scenes are on the outside of a marble early christian sarcophagus used for the burial of junius bassus  he died in      this sarcophagus has been described as  probably the single most famous piece of early christian relief sculpture   the sarcophagus was originally placed in or under old st  peter s basilica  was rediscovered in       and is now below the modern basilica in the museo storico del tesoro della basilica di san pietro  museum of st  peter s basilica  in the vatican  the base is approximately             feet  the old testament scenes depicted were chosen as precursors of christ s sacrifice in the new testament  in an early form of typology  just to the right of the middle is daniel in the lion s den and on the left is abraham about to sacrifice isaac 

george segal created figural sculptures by molding plastered gauze strips over live models in his      work  abraham s farewell to ishmael   the human condition was central to his concerns  and segal used the old testament as a source for his imagery  this sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by abraham when sarah demanded that he expel hagar and ishmael  in the sculpture  the father s tenderness  sarah s rage  and hagar s resigned acceptance portray a range of human emotions  the sculpture was donated to the miami art museum after the artist s death in      

usually abraham can be identified by the context of the image the meeting with melchizedek    or   in solo portraits a sword or knife may be used as his attribute  as in by gian maria morlaiter or by lorenzo monaco  he always wears a gray or white beard 

as early as the beginning of the  rd century  christian art followed christian typology in making the sacrifice of isaac a foreshadowing of christ s sacrifice on the cross and its memorial in the sacrifice of the mass  see for example engraved with abraham s and other sacrifices taken to prefigure that of christ in the eucharist 

some early christian writers interpreted the three visitors as the triune god  thus in santa maria maggiore  rome  portrays only the visitors against a gold ground and puts semitransparent copies of them in the  heavenly  space above the scene  in eastern orthodox art the visit is the chief means by which the trinity is pictured     some images do not include abraham and sarah  like andrei rublev s  trinity   which shows only the three visitors as beardless youths at a table 

 fear and trembling   original danish title   frygt og b  ven   is an influential philosophical work by s  ren kierkegaard  published in      under the pseudonym  johannes de silentio    john the silent    kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in abraham when god asked him to sacrifice his son 

in       steve reich released an opera named  the cave   the title refers to the cave of the patriarchs  the narrative of the opera is based on the story of abraham and his immediate family as it is recounted in the various religious texts  and as it is understood by individual people from different cultures and religious traditions 

bob dylan s  highway    revisited  is the title track for his      album  highway    revisited   in        rolling stone  magazine ranked the song as number     in their     greatest songs of all time  the song has five stanzas  in each stanza  someone describes an unusual problem that is ultimately resolved on highway     in stanza    god tells abraham to  kill me a son   god wants the killing done on highway     abram  the original name of the biblical abraham  is also the name of dylan s own father 






abraxas

abraxas  gk                  variant form abrasax                  is a word of mystic meaning in the system of the gnostic basilides  being there applied to the  great archon   gk    megas arch  n    the princeps of the     spheres  gk    ouranoi    the word is found in gnostic texts such as the  holy book of the great invisible spirit   and also appears in the greek magical papyri  it was engraved on certain antique gemstones  called on that account abraxas stones  which were used as amulets or charms  as the initial spelling on stones was  abrasax                    the spelling of  abraxas  seen today probably originates in the confusion made between the greek letters sigma      and xi      in the latin transliteration 

the seven letters spelling its name may represent each of the seven classic planets  the word may be related to  abracadabra   although other explanations exist 

there are similarities and differences between such figures in reports about basilides s teaching  ancient gnostic texts  the larger greco roman magical traditions  and modern magical and esoteric writings  speculations have proliferated on abraxas in recent centuries  who has been claimed to be both an egyptian god and a demon 

gaius julius hyginus   fab        gives  abrax aslo therbeeo  as names of horses of the sun mentioned by  homerus   the passage is miserably corrupt  but it may not be accidental that the first three syllables make abraxas 

the proper form of the name is evidently  abrasax   as with the greek writers  hippolytus  epiphanias  didymus   de trin   iii       and theodoret  also augustine and  praedestinatus   and in nearly all the legends on gems  by a probably euphonic inversion the translator of irenaeus and the other latin authors have  abraxas   which is found in the magical papyri  and even  though most sparingly  on engraved stones 

the attempts to discover a derivation for the name  greek  hebrew  coptic  or other  have not been entirely successful 




perhaps the word may be included among those mysterious expressions discussed by adolf von harnack     which belong to no known speech  and by their singular collocation of vowels and consonants give evidence that they belong to some mystic dialect  or take their origin from some supposed divine inspiration    

the egyptian author of the book  de mysteriis  in reply to porphyry  vii     admits a preference of  barbarous  to vernacular names in sacred things  urging a peculiar sanctity in the languages of certain nations  as the egyptians and assyrians  and origen   contra cels   i      refers to the  potent names  used by egyptian sages  persian magi  and indian brahmins  signifying deities in the several languages 

it is uncertain what the actual role and function of abraxas was in the basilidian system  as our authorities  see below  often show no direct acquaintance with the doctrines of basilides himself 

in the system described by irenaeus   the unbegotten father  is the progenitor of  nous   and from  nous logos   from  logos phronesis   from  phronesis sophia  and  dynamis   from  sophia  and  dynamis  principalities  powers  and angels  the last of whom create  the first heaven   they in turn originate a second series  who create a second heaven  the process continues in like manner until     heavens are in existence  the angels of the last or visible heaven being the authors of our world   the ruler    principem  i e    probably  ton archonta   of the     heavens  is abraxas  and for this reason he contains within himself     numbers  

the name occurs in the  refutation of all heresies   vii      by hippolytus  who appears in these chapters to have followed the  exegetica  of basilides  after describing the manifestation of the gospel in the ogdoad and hebdomad  he adds that the basilidians have a long account of the innumerable creations and powers in the several  stages  of the upper world   diastemata    in which they speak of     heavens and say that  their great archon  is abrasax  because his name contains the number      the number of the days in the year  i e  the sum of the numbers denoted by the greek letters in                according to the rules of isopsephy is     

epiphanius   haer          f   appears to follow partly irenaeus  partly the lost compendium of hippolytus  he designates abraxas more distinctly as  the power above all  and first principle    the cause and first archetype  of all things  and mentions that the basilidians referred to     as the number of parts   mele   in the human body  as well as of days in the year 

the author of the appendix to tertullian  de praescr  haer    c      who likewise follows hippolytus s compendium  adds some further particulars  that  abraxas  gave birth to mind   nous    the first in the series of primary powers enumerated likewise by irenaeus and epiphanius  that the world  as well as the     heavens  was created in honour of  abraxas   and that christ was sent not by the maker of the world but by  abraxas  

nothing can be built on the vague allusions of jerome  according to whom  abraxas  meant for basilides  the greatest god    de vir  ill         the highest god    dial  adv  lucif         the almighty god    comm  in amos  iii      and  the lord the creator    comm  in nah   i       the notices in theodoret   haer  fab   i      augustine   haer       and  praedestinatus   i      have no independent value 

it is evident from these particulars that abrasax was the name of the first of the     archons  and accordingly stood below sophia and dynamis and their progenitors  but his position is not expressly stated  so that the writer of the supplement to tertullian had some excuse for confusing him with  the supreme god  

with the availability of primary sources  such as those in the nag hammadi library  the identity of abrasax remains unclear  the  holy book of the great invisible spirit   for instance  refers to abrasax as an aeon dwelling with sophia and other aeons of the pleroma in the light of the luminary eleleth  in several texts  the luminary eleleth is the last of the luminaries  spiritual lights  that come forward  and it is the aeon sophia  associated with eleleth  who encounters darkness and becomes involved in the chain of events that leads to the demiurge s rule of this world  and the salvage effort that ensues  as such  the role of aeons of eleleth  including abraxas  sophia  and others  pertains to this outer border of the pleroma that encounters the ignorance of the world of lack and interacts to rectify the error of ignorance in the world of materiality 

the catholic church later deemed abraxas a pagan god  and ultimately branded him a demon as documented in j  collin de plancy s  infernal dictionary   abraxas  or abracax  is labeled the  supreme god  of the basilidians  whom he describes as  heretics of the second century   he further indicated the basilidians attributed to abraxas the rule over      skies  and      virtues   in a final statement on basilidians  de plancy states that their view was that jesus christ was merely a  benevolent ghost sent on earth by abracax  

a vast number of engraved stones are in existence  to which the name  abrasax stones  has long been given  one particularly fine example was included as part of the thetford treasure from fourth century norfolk  uk  the subjects are mythological  and chiefly grotesque  with various inscriptions  in which                often occurs  alone or with other words  sometimes the whole space is taken up with the inscription  in certain obscure magical writings of egyptian origin                 or                 is found associated with other names which frequently accompany it on gems  it is also found on the greek metal  tesser    among other mystic words  the meaning of the legends is seldom intelligible  but some of the gems are amulets  and the same may be the case with nearly all 


in a great majority of instances the name abrasax is associated with a singular composite figure  having a chimera like appearance somewhat resembling a basilisk or the greek primordial god chronos  not to be confused with the greek titan cronus   according to e  a  wallis budge   as a pantheus  i e  all god  he appears on the amulets with the head of a cock  ph  bus  or of a lion  ra or mithras   the body of a man  and his legs are serpents which terminate in scorpions  types of the agathodaimon  in his right hand he grasps a club  or a flail  and in his left is a round or oval shield   this form was also referred to as the anguipede  budge surmised that abrasax was  a form of the adam kadmon of the kabbalists and the primal man whom god made in his own image  

some parts at least of the figure mentioned above are solar symbols  and the basilidian abrasax is manifestly connected with the sun  j  j  bellermann has speculated that  the whole represents the supreme being  with his five great emanations  each one pointed out by means of an expressive emblem  thus  from the human body  the usual form assigned to the deity  forasmuch as it is written that god created man in his own image  issue the two supporters   nous  and  logos   symbols of the inner sense and the quickening understanding  as typified by the serpents  for the same reason that had induced the old greeks to assign this reptile for an attribute to pallas  his head   a cock s   represents  phronesis   the fowl being emblematical of foresight and vigilance  his two hands bear the badges of  sophia  and  dynamis   the shield of wisdom  and the scourge of power  

in the absence of other evidence to show the origin of these curious relics of antiquity the occurrence of a name known as basilidian on patristic authority has not unnaturally been taken as a sufficient mark of origin  and the early collectors and critics assumed this whole group to be the work of gnostics  during the last three centuries attempts have been made to sift away successively those gems that had no claim to be considered in any sense gnostic  or specially basilidian  or connected with abrasax  the subject is one which has exercised the ingenuity of many savants  but it may be said that all the engraved stones fall into three classes 

while it would be rash to assert positively that no existing gems were the work of gnostics  there is no valid reason for attributing all of them to such an origin  the fact that the name occurs on these gems in connection with representations of figures with the head of a cock  a lion  or an ass  and the tail of a serpent was formerly taken in the light of what irenaeus says about the followers of basilides 

incantations by mystic names were characteristic of the hybrid gnosticism planted in spain and southern gaul at the end of the fourth century and at the beginning of the fifth  which jerome connects with basilides and which  according to his  epist    lxxv   used the name abrasax 

it is therefore not unlikely that some gnostics used amulets  though the confident assertions of modern writers to this effect rest on no authority  isaac de beausobre properly calls attention to the significant silence of clement in the two passages in which he instructs the christians of alexandria on the right use of rings and gems  and the figures which may legitimately be engraved on them   paed       ff       ff    but no attempt to identify the figures on existing gems with the personages of gnostic mythology has had any success  and  abrasax  is the only gnostic term found in the accompanying legends that is not known to belong to other religions or mythologies  the present state of the evidence therefore suggests that their engravers and the basilidians received the mystic name from a common source now unknown 

having due regard to the magic papyri  in which many of the unintelligible names of the abrasax stones reappear  besides directions for making and using gems with similar figures and formulas for magical purposes  it can scarcely be doubted that many of these stones are pagan amulets and instruments of magic 

the magic papyri reflect the same ideas as the abrasax gems and often bear hebraic names of god  the following example is illustrative   i conjure you by ia   saba  th ad  nai abrasax  and by the great god  iae     the patriarchs are sometimes addressed as deities  for which fact many instances may be adduced  in the group  iakoubia  ia  saba  th ad  nai abrasax   the first name seems to be composed of jacob and ya  similarly  entities considered angels in judaism are invoked as gods alongside abrasax  thus  i conjure you    by the god micha  l  by the god souri  l  by the god gabri  l  by the god rapha  l  by the god abrasax ablathanalba akrammachari     

in text pgm v          abrasax is identified as part of the  true name which has been transmitted to the prophets of israel  of the  headless one  who created heaven and earth  who created night and day    osoronnophris whom none has ever seen    awesome and invisible god with an empty spirit   the name also includes ia   and ad  nai   osoronnophris  represents egyptian  wsir wn nfr    osiris the perfect being   another identification with osiris is made in pgm vii           you are not wine  but the guts of osiris  the guts of    ablanathanalba akrammachamarei eee  who has been stationed over necessity  iakoub ia ia   saba  th ad  nai abrasax   pgm viii        on the other hand  identifies abrasax as a name of  hermes   i e  thoth   here the numerological properties of the name are invoked  with its seven letters corresponding to the seven planets and its isopsephic value of     corresponding to the days of the year  thoth is also identified with abrasax in pgm lxxix        i am the soul of darkness  abrasax  the eternal one  micha  l  but my true name is th  outh  th  outh  

one papyrus titled the  monad  or the  eighth book of moses   pgm xiii         contains an invocation to a supreme creator god  abrasax is given as being the name of this god in the language of the baboons  the papyrus goes on to describe a cosmogonic myth about abrasax  describing how he created the ogdoad by laughing  his first laughter created light  his second divided the primordial waters  his third created the mind  his fourth created fertility and procreation  his fifth created fate  his sixth created time  as the sun and moon   and his seventh and final laughter created the soul  then  from various sounds made by abrasax  there arose the serpent python who  foreknew all things   the first man  or fear   and the god ia     who is lord of all   the man fought with ia    and abrasax declared that ia   s power would derive from both of the others  and that ia   would take precedence over all the other gods  this text also describes helios as an archangel of god abrasax 

the leyden papyrus recommends that this invocation be pronounced to the moon 
the magic word  ablanathanalba   which reads in greek the same backward as forward  also occurs in the abrasax stones as well as in the magic papyri  this word is usually conceded to be derived from the hebrew  aramaic   meaning  thou art our father                    and also occurs in connection with abrasax  the following inscription is found upon a metal plate in the carlsruhe museum 

              
              
            














absalom

absalom     avshalom    father of peace    according to the hebrew bible  was the third son of david  king of israel with maacah  daughter of talmai  king of geshur 

absalom  david s third son  by maacah  was born in hebron  he moved at an early age along with the transfer of the capital to jerusalem  where he spent most of his life  he was a great favorite of his father  and of the people  his charming manners  personal beauty  insinuating ways  love of pomp  and royal pretensions  captivated the hearts of the people from the beginning  he lived in great style  drove in a magnificent chariot  and had fifty men run before him 

little is known of absalom s family life  but the biblical narrative states that he had three sons and one daughter  whose name was tamar   from the language of    i have no son to keep my name in remembrance   it is inferred that his sons died at an early age 

absalom s sister  who was also called tamar  was raped by amnon  who was their half brother  amnon was also david s eldest son  after the rape  absalom waited two years  and then avenged tamar by sending his servants to murder a drunken amnon at a feast  to which absalom had invited all the king s sons    

after this murder absalom fled to talmai  who was the king of geshur and absalom s maternal grandfather  see also or    it was not until three years later that absalom was fully reinstated in his father s favour and finally returned to jerusalem  see joab  

while at jerusalem  absalom built support for himself by speaking to those who came to king david for justice  saying     see  your claims are good and right  but there is no one deputed by the king to hear you   perhaps reflecting flaws in the judicial system of the united monarchy   if only i were the judge of the land  then all who had a suit or cause might come to me  and i would give them justice   he made gestures of flattery by kissing those who bowed before him instead of accepting supplication  he  stole the hearts of the people of israel  

after four years he declared himself king  raised a revolt at hebron  the former capital  and slept with his father s concubines  all israel and judah flocked to him  and david  attended only by the cherethites and pelethites and his former bodyguard  which had followed him from gath  found it expedient to flee  the priests zadok and abiathar remained in jerusalem  and their sons jonathan and ahimaaz served as david s spies  absalom reached the capital and consulted with the renowned ahithophel  sometimes spelled achitophel  

david took refuge from absalom s forces beyond the jordan river  however  he took the precaution of instructing a servant  hushai  to infiltrate absalom s court and subvert it  hushai convinced absalom to ignore ahithophel s advice to attack his father while he was on the run  and instead to prepare his forces for a major attack  this gave david critical time to prepare his own troops for the battle 

a fateful battle was fought in the wood of ephraim  the name suggests a locality west of the jordan  and absalom s army was completely routed  absalom s head was caught in the boughs of an oak tree as the mule he was riding ran beneath it  he was discovered there still alive by one of david s men  who reported this to joab  the king s commander  joab  accustomed to avenging himself  took this opportunity to even the score with absalom  absalom had once set joab s field on fire and then made amasa captain of the host instead of joab  killing absalom was against david s explicit command   beware that none touch the young man absalom   joab killed absalom with three darts through the heart 

when david heard that absalom was killed  although not how he was killed  he greatly sorrowed 
david withdrew to the city  mahanaim  in mourning  until joab roused him from  the extravagance of his grief  and called on him to fulfil his duty to his people 

absalom had erected a monument near jerusalem to perpetuate his name 

now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar  which is in the king s dale  for he said  i have no son to keep my name in remembrance  and he called the pillar after his own name  and it is called unto this day  absalom s place 

an ancient monument in the kidron valley near the old city of jerusalem  known as the tomb of absalom or absalom s pillar and traditionally identified as the monument of the biblical narrative  is now dated by modern archeologists to the first century ad

abydos  egypt

abydos    sahidic    is one of the oldest cities of ancient egypt  and also of the eighth nome in upper egypt  of which it was the capital city  it is located about west of the nile at latitude          n  near the modern egyptian towns of el  araba el madfuna and al balyana  in the ancient egyptian language  the city was called abdju        b   w  or  abdw    the english name  abydos  comes from the greek   a name borrowed by greek geographers from the unrelated city of abydos on the hellespont 

considered one of the most important archaeological sites in egypt  the sacred city of abydos was the site of many ancient temples  including umm el qa ab  a royal necropolis where early pharaohs were entombed  these tombs began to be seen as extremely significant burials and in later times it became desirable to be buried in the area  leading to the growth of the town s importance as a cult site  

today  abydos is notable for the memorial temple of seti i  which contains an inscription from the nineteenth dynasty known to the modern world as the abydos king list  it is a chronological list showing cartouches of most dynastic pharaohs of egypt from menes until seti i s father  ramesses i 

the great temple and most of the ancient town are buried under the modern buildings to the north of the seti temple  many of the original structures and the artifacts within them are considered irretrievable and lost  many may have been destroyed by the new construction 

abydos was occupied by the rulers of the predynastic period  whose town  temple and tombs have been found there  the temple and town continued to be rebuilt at intervals down to the times of the thirtieth dynasty  and the cemetery was used continuously 

the pharaohs of the first dynasty were buried in abydos  including narmer  who is regarded as founder of the first dynasty  and his successor  aha  it was in this time period that the abydos boats were constructed  some pharaohs of the second dynasty were also buried in abydos  the temple was renewed and enlarged by these pharaohs as well  funerary enclosures  misinterpreted in modern times as great  forts   were built on the desert behind the town by three kings of the second dynasty  the most complete is that of khasekhemwy 

from the fifth dynasty  the deity khentiamentiu   foremost of the westerners   came to be seen as a manifestation of the dead pharaoh in the underworld  pepi i  sixth dynasty  constructed a funerary chapel which evolved over the years into the great temple of osiris  the ruins of which still exist within the town enclosure  abydos became the centre of the worship of the isis and osiris cult 

during the first intermediate period  the principal deity of the area  khentiamentiu  began to be seen as an aspect of osiris  and the deities gradually merged and came to be regarded as one  khentiamentiu s name became an epithet of osiris  king mentuhotep ii was the first one building a royal chapel  in the twelfth dynasty a gigantic tomb was cut into the rock by senusret iii  associated with this tomb was a  cenotaph   a cult temple and a small town known as  wah sut   that was used by the workers for these structures  next to that cenotaph were buried at least two kings of the thirteenth dynasty  in tombs s  and s    and some rulers of the second intermediate period  such as senebkay  an indigenous line of kings  the abydos dynasty  may have ruled the region from abydos at the time 

the building during the eighteenth dynasty began with a large chapel of ahmose i  the pyramid of ahmose i was also constructed at abydos   the only pyramid in the area  very little of it remains today 

thutmose iii built a far larger temple  about   he also made a processional way leading past the side of the temple to the cemetery beyond  featuring a great gateway of granite 

seti i  in the nineteenth dynasty  founded a temple to the south of the town in honor of the ancestral pharaohs of the early dynasties  this was finished by ramesses ii  who also built a lesser temple of his own  merneptah added the osireion just to the north of the temple of seti 

ahmose ii in the twenty sixth dynasty rebuilt the temple again  and placed in it a large monolith shrine of red granite  finely wrought  the foundations of the successive temples were comprised within approximately   depth of the ruins discovered in modern times  these needed the closest examination to discriminate the various buildings  and were recorded by more than       measurements and       levellings 

the latest building was a new temple of nectanebo i  built in the thirtieth dynasty  from the ptolemaic times of the greek occupancy of egypt  that began three hundred years before the roman occupancy that followed  the structure began to decay and no later works are known 

from earliest times  abydos was a cult centre  first of the local deity  khentiamentiu  and from the end of the old kingdom  the rising cult of osiris and isis 

a tradition developed that the early dynastic cemetery was the burial place of osiris and the tomb of djer was reinterpreted as that of osiris 

decorations in tombs throughout egypt  such as the one displayed to the right  record journeys to and from abydos  as important pilgrimages made by individuals who were proud to have been able to make the vital trip 

successively from the first dynasty to the twenty sixth dynasty  nine or ten temples were built on one site at abydos  the first was an enclosure  about   surrounded by a thin wall of unbaked bricks  incorporating one wall of this first structure  the second temple of about square was built within a wall about thick  an outer  temenos   enclosure  wall surrounded the grounds  this outer wall was thickened about the second or third dynasty  the old temple entirely vanished in the fourth dynasty  and a smaller building was erected behind it  enclosing a wide hearth of black ashes  pottery models of offerings are found in these ashes and probably were the substitutes for live sacrifices decreed by khufu  or cheops  in his temple reforms 

at an undetermined date  a great clearance of temple offerings had been made and a modern discovery of a chamber into which they were gathered yielded the fine ivory carvings and the glazed figures and tiles that show the splendid work of the first dynasty  a vase of menes with purple hieroglyphs inlaid into a green glaze and tiles with relief figures are the most important pieces found  the noble statuette of cheops in ivory  found in the stone chamber of the temple  gives the only portrait of this great pharaoh 

the temple was rebuilt entirely on a larger scale by pepi i in the sixth dynasty  he placed a great stone gateway to the temenos  an outer temenos wall and gateway  with a colonnade between the gates  his temple was about inside  with stone gateways front and back  showing that it was of the processional type  in the eleventh dynasty mentuhotep i added a colonnade and altars  soon after  mentuhotep ii entirely rebuilt the temple  laying a stone pavement over the area  about square  and added subsidiary chambers  soon thereafter in the twelfth dynasty  senusret i laid massive foundations of stone over the pavement of his predecessor  a great temenos was laid out enclosing a much larger area and the new temple itself was about three times the earlier size 

the temple of seti i was built on entirely new ground half a mile to the south of the long series of temples just described  this surviving building is best known as the great temple of abydos  being nearly complete and an impressive sight  a principal purpose of the temple was that of a memorial temple to the king seti i  as well as reverence of the early pharaohs  which is incorporated within as part of the  rite of the ancestors   the long list of the pharaohs of the principal dynasties   recognized by seti   are carved on a wall and known as the  abydos king list   showing the cartouche name of many dynastic pharaohs of egypt from the first  narmer or menes  until his time   with the exception of those noted above  there were significant names deliberately left out of the list  so rare as an almost complete list of pharaoh names  the table of abydos  re discovered by william john bankes  has been called the  rosetta stone  of egyptian archaeology  analogous to the rosetta stone for egyptian writing  beyond the narmer palette 

there also were seven chapels built for the worship of the pharaoh and principal deities  being the  state  deities ptah  re horakhty  and  centrally positioned  amun re  the remaining three chapels are dedicated to the abydos triad of osiris  isis and horus  the rites recorded in the deity chapels represent the first complete form of the daily ritual  which was performed throughout temples daily in egypt throughout the pharaonic period  at the back of the temple is an enigmatic structure known as the osireion  which served as a cenotaph for seti osiris  and is thought to be connected with the worship of osiris as an  osiris tomb   it is possible that from those chambers led out the great hypogeum for the celebration of the osiris mysteries  built by merenptah  the temple was originally long  but the forecourts are scarcely recognizable  and the part still in good condition is about

except for the list of pharaohs and a panegyric on ramesses ii  the subjects are not historical  but religious in nature  dedicated to the transformation of the king after his death  the temple reliefs are celebrated for their delicacy and artistic refinement  utilizing both the archaism of earlier dynasties with the vibrancy of late   th dynasty reliefs  the sculptures had been published mostly in hand copy  not facsimile  by auguste mariette in his  abydos   i  the temple has been partially recorded epigraphically by amice calverley and myrtle broome in their   volume publication of  the temple of king sethos i at abydos                

the adjacent temple of ramesses ii was much smaller and simpler in plan  but it had a fine historical series of scenes around the outside that lauded his achievements  of which the lower parts remain  the outside of the temple was decorated with scenes of the battle of kadesh  his list of pharaohs  similar to that of seti i  formerly stood here  but the fragments were removed by the french consul and sold to the british museum 

the royal necropolis of the earliest dynasties were placed about a mile into the great desert plain  in a place now known as umm el qa ab  the mother of pots  because of the shards remaining from all of the devotional objects left by religious pilgrims 

the earliest burial is about inside  a pit lined with brick walls  and originally roofed with timber and matting  others also built before menes are   the probable tomb of menes is of the latter size  afterward the tombs increase in size and complexity  the tomb pit is surrounded by chambers to hold offerings  the sepulchre being a great wooden chamber in the midst of the brick lined pit  rows of small pits  tombs for the servants of the pharaoh surround the royal chamber  many dozens of such burials being usual  some of the offerings included sacrificed animals  such as the asses found in the tomb of merneith  evidence of human sacrifice exists in the early tombs  such as the     servants in the tomb of merneith  but this practice was changed into symbolic offerings later 

by the end of the second dynasty the type of tomb constructed changed to a long passage bordered with chambers on either side  the royal burial being in the middle of the length  the greatest of these tombs with its dependencies  covered a space of over   however it is possible for this to be several tombs which have met in the making of a tomb  the egyptians had no means of mapping the positioning of the tombs  the contents of the tombs have been nearly destroyed by successive plunderers  but enough remained to show that rich jewellery was placed on the mummies  a profusion of vases of hard and valuable stones from the royal table service stood about the body  the store rooms were filled with great jars of wine  perfumed ointments  and other supplies  and tablets of ivory and of ebony were engraved with a record of the yearly annals of the reigns  the seals of various officials  of which over     varieties have been found  give an insight into the public arrangements 

the cemetery of private persons began during the first dynasty with some pit tombs in the town  it was extensive in the twelfth and thirteenth dynasties and contained many rich tombs  a large number of fine tombs were made in the eighteenth to twentieth dynasties  and members of later dynasties continued to bury their dead here until the roman period  many hundreds of funeral steles were removed by auguste mariette s workmen  without any record of the burials being made  later excavations have been recorded by edward r  ayrton  abydos  iii   maclver   el amrah and abydos   and garstang   el arabah  

some of the tomb structures  referred to as  forts  by modern researchers  lay behind the town  known as shunet ez zebib  it is about over all  and one still stands high  it was built by khasekhemwy  the last pharaoh of the second dynasty  another structure nearly as large adjoined it  and probably is older than that of khasekhemwy  a third  fort  of a squarer form is now occupied by a convent of the coptic orthodox church of alexandria  its age cannot be ascertained 

some of the hieroglyphs carved over an arch on the site have been interpreted in esoteric and  ufological  circles as depicting modern technology 

the carvings are often thought to be a helicopter  a battle tank or submarine  and a fighter plane  some interpret this as a u f o   however  these conjectures are largely based in pseudoarchaeology  and the picture often claimed as  evidence  has been retouched  see right  







abydos  hellespont 

abydos      was an ancient city and bishopric in mysia  it was located at the nara burnu promontory on the asian coast of the hellespont  opposite the ancient city of sestos  and near the city of   anakkale in turkey  abydos was founded in c      at the most narrow point in the straits  and thus was one of the main crossing points between europe and asia  until its replacement by the crossing between lampsacus and kallipolis in the   th century  and the abandonment of abydos in the early   th century 

in greek mythology  abydos is presented in the myth of hero and leander as the home of leander  the city is also mentioned in  rodanthe and dosikles   a novel written by theodore prodromos  a   th century writer  in which dosikles kidnaps rodanthe at abydos 

in       the site of abydos was first identified  and was subsequently visited by numerous classicists and travellers  such as robert wood  richard chandler  and lord byron  the city s acropolis is known in turkish as mal tepe 

following the city s abandonment  the ruins of abydos were scavenged for building materials from the   th to the   th century  and remains of walls and buildings continued to be reported until at least the   th century  however  little remains and the area was declared a restricted military zone in the early   th century  thus little to no excavation has taken place 

abydos is mentioned in the  iliad  as a trojan ally  and  according to strabo  was occupied by bebryces and later thracians after the trojan war  it has been suggested that the city was originally a phoenician colony as there was a temple of aphrodite porne  aphrodite the harlot  within abydos  abydos was settled by milesian colonists contemporaneously with the foundation of the cities of priapos and prokonnesos in   strabo related that gyges  king of lydia  granted his consent to the milesians to settle abydos  it is argued that this was carried out by milesian mercenaries to act as a garrison to prevent thracian raids into asia minor  the city became a thriving centre for tuna exportation as a result of the high yield of tuna in the hellespont 

abydos was ruled by daphnis  a pro persian tyrant  in the    s bc  but was occupied by the persian empire in      darius i destroyed the city following his scythian campaign in      abydos participated in the ionian revolt in the early  th century bc  however  the city returned briefly to persian control as  in      at the onset of the second persian invasion of greece  xerxes i and the persian army passed through abydos on their march to greece  after the failed persian invasion  abydos became a member of the athenian led delian league  and was part of the hellespontine district  ostensibly an ally  abydos was hostile to athens throughout this time  and contributed a  phoros  of     talents  xenophon documented that abydos possessed gold mines at astyra or kremaste at the time of his writing 

during the second peloponnesian war  a spartan expedition led by dercylidas arrived at abydos in early may     bc and successfully convinced the city to defect from the delian league and fight against athens  at which time he was made harmost  commander governor  of abydos  a spartan fleet was defeated by athens at abydos in the autumn of     bc  abydos was attacked by the athenians in the winter of         bc  but was repelled by a persian force led by pharnabazus  satrap  governor  of hellespontine phrygia  dercylidas held the office of harmost of abydos until at least   according to aristotle  abydos had an oligarchic constitution at this time  at the beginning of the corinthian war in     bc  agesilaus ii  king of sparta  passed through abydos into thrace  abydos remained an ally of sparta throughout the war and dercylidas served as harmost of the city from     until he was replaced by anaxibius in   the latter was killed in an ambush near abydos by the athenian general iphicrates in   at the conclusion of the corinthian war  under the terms of the peace of antalcidas in     bc  abydos was annexed to the persian empire  within the persian empire  abydos was administered as part of the satrapy of hellespontine phrygia  and was ruled by the tyrant philiscus in      in   the city came under the control of the tyrant iphiades 

abydos remained under persian control until it was seized by a macedonian army led by parmenion  a general of alexander the great  in the spring of     bc  in      whilst parmenion besieged the city of pitane  abydos was besieged by a persian army led by memnon of rhodes  forcing parmenion to abandon his siege of pitane and march north to relieve abydos  alexander ferried across from sestos to abydos in     and travelled south to the city of troy  after which he returned to abydos  the following day  alexander left abydos and led his army north to percote  alexander later established a royal mint at abydos  as well as at other cities in asia minor 

after the death of alexander the great in     bc  abydos  as part of the satrapy of hellespontine phrygia  came under the control of leonnatus as a result of the partition of babylon  at the partition of triparadisus in     bc  arrhidaeus succeeded leonnatus as satrap of hellespontine phrygia 

in      during the fourth war of the diadochi  lysimachus  king of thrace  crossed over into asia minor and invaded the kingdom of antigonus i  unlike the neighbouring cities of parium and lampsacus which surrendered  abydos resisted lysimachus and was besieged  lysimachus was forced to abandon the siege  however  after the arrival of a relief force sent by demetrius  son of king antigonus i  according to polybius  by the third century bc  the neighbouring city of arisbe had become subordinate to abydos  the city of dardanus also came under the control of abydos at some point in the hellenistic period  abydos became part of the seleucid empire after     bc  the city was conquered by ptolemy iii euergetes  king of egypt  in     bc  and remained under ptolemaic control until at least      as abydos had become part of the kingdom of pergamon by c      bc 
during the second macedonian war  abydos was besieged by philip v  king of macedonia  in     bc  during which many of its citizens chose to commit suicide rather than surrender  marcus aemilius lepidus met with philip v during the siege to deliver an ultimatum on behalf of the roman senate  ultimately  the city was forced to surrender to philip v due to a lack of reinforcements  the macedonian occupation ended after the peace of flamininus at the end of the war in     bc  at this time  abydos was substantially depopulated and partially ruined as a result of the macedonian occupation 

in the spring of     bc  abydos was seized by antiochus iii   megas basileus  of the seleucid empire  who refortified the city in         bc  antiochus iii later withdrew from abydos during the roman seleucid war  thus allowing for the transportation of the roman army into asia minor by october     bc  dardanus was subsequently liberated from abydene control  and the treaty of apamea of     bc returned abydos to the kingdom of pergamon  a gymnasium was active at abydos in the  nd century bc 

attalus iii  king of pergamon  bequeathed his kingdom to rome upon his death in     bc  and thus abydos became part of the province of asia  the gold mines of abydos at astyra or kremaste were near exhaustion at the time was strabo was writing  the city was counted amongst the  telonia   custom houses  of the province of asia in the  lex portorii asiae  of    ad  and formed part of the  conventus iuridicus adramytteum   abydos is mentioned in the  tabula peutingeriana  and antonine itinerary  the mint of abydos ceased to function in the mid  rd century ad 

it is believed that abydos  with sestos and lampsacus  is referred to as one of the  three large capital cities  of the roman empire in  weil  e   a  rd century ad chinese text  the city was the centre for customs collection at the southern entrance of the sea of marmara  and was administered by an  komes ton stenon   count of the straits  or an  archon  from the  rd century to the  th century ad  in the  th century ad  emperor justinian i introduced the office of  komes abydou  with responsibility for collecting customs duty in abydos 

pope martin i rested at abydos in the summer of     whilst en route to constantinople  as a result of the administrative reforms of the  th century  abydos came to be administered as part of the theme of opsikion  the office of  kommerkiarios  of abydos is first attested in the mid  th century  and was later sometimes combined with the office of  paraphylax   the military governor of the fort  introduced in the  th century  at which time the office of  komes ton stenon  is last mentioned 

after the  th century ad  abydos became a major seaport  maslama ibn abd al malik  during his campaign against constantinople  crossed over into thrace at abydos in july      the office of  archon  at abydos was restored in the late  th century and endured until the early  th century  in      empress irene reduced commercial tariffs collected at abydos  emperor nikephoros i  irene s successor  introduced a tax on slaves purchased beyond the city  the city later also became part of the theme of the aegean sea and was the seat of a  tourmarches  

abydos was sacked by an arab fleet led by leo of tripoli in     ad whilst en route to constantinople  the revolt of bardas phokas was defeated by emperor basil ii at abydos in     ad  in      the venetians were granted reduced commercial tariffs at abydos as a special privilege  in the early   th century  abydos became the seat of a separate command and the office of  strategos   governor  of abydos is first mentioned in      with authority over the northern shore of the hellespont and the islands of the sea of marmara 

in       a rus  raid led by a certain chrysocheir defeated the local commander at abydos and proceeded to travel south through the hellespont  following the battle of manzikert  abydos was seized by the seljuk turks  but was recovered in      ad  in which year leo kephalas was appointed  katepano  of abydos  abydos  population likely increased at this time as a result of the arrival of refugees from northwestern anatolia who had fled the advance of the turks  in            the city was attacked by tzachas  a turkish pirate  emperor manuel i komnenos repaired abydos  fortifications in the late   th century 

by the   th century ad  the crossing from lampsacus to kallipolis had become more common and largely replaced the crossing from abydos to sestos  during the fourth crusade  in       the venetians seized abydos  and  following the sack of constantinople and the formation of the latin empire later that year  emperor baldwin granted the land between abydos and adramyttium to his brother henry of flanders  henry of flanders passed through abydos on    november      and continued his march to adramyttium  abydos was seized by the empire of nicaea  a successor state of the eastern roman empire  during its offensive in            but was reconquered by the latin empire in            the city was later recovered by emperor john iii vatatzes  abydos declined in the   th century  and was eventually abandoned between      and           due to the threat of turkish tribes and disintegration of roman control over the region 

the bishopric of abydus appears in all the  notitiae episcopatuum  of the patriarchate of constantinople from the mid  th century until the time of andronikos iii palaiologos         first as a suffragan of cyzicus and then from      as a metropolitan see without suffragans  the earliest bishop mentioned in extant documents is marcian  who signed the joint letter of the bishops of hellespontus to emperor leo i the thracian in      protesting about the murder of proterius of alexandria  a letter of peter the fuller             mentions a bishop of abydus called pamphilus  ammonius signed the decretal letter of the council of constantinople in     against severus of antioch and others  isidore was at the third council of constantinople              john at the trullan council        theodore at the second council of nicaea        an unnamed bishop of abydus was a counsellor of emperor nikephoros ii in     

seals attest theodosius as bishop of abydos in the   th century  and john as metropolitan bishop of abydos in the      th century  abydos remained a metropolitan see until the city fell to the turks in the   th century  the diocese is currently a titular see of the patriarchate of constantinople  and gerasimos papadopoulos was titular bishop of abydos from      until his death in       simeon kruzhkov was bishop of abydos from may to september       kyrillos katerelos was consecrated bishop of abydos in      

in       during the latin occupation  the papal legate giovanni colonna united the dioceses of abydos and madytos and placed the see under direct papal authority  no longer a residential bishopric  abydus is today listed by the catholic church as a titular see  and has had the following incumbents

acacia sensu lato

acacia s l    or    known commonly as mimosa  acacia  thorntree or wattle  is a polyphyletic genus of shrubs and trees belonging to the subfamily mimosoideae of the family fabaceae  it was described by the swedish botanist carl linnaeus in      based on the african species  acacia nilotica   many non australian species tend to be thorny  whereas the majority of australian acacias are not  all species are pod bearing  with sap and leaves often bearing large amounts of tannins and condensed tannins that historically found use as pharmaceuticals and preservatives 

the genus  acacia  constitutes  in its traditional circumspection  the second largest genus in fabaceae   astragalus  being the largest   with roughly       species  about     of them native to australia  with the remainder spread around the tropical to warm temperate regions of both hemispheres  including europe  africa  southern asia  and the americas  see list of  acacia  species   the genus was divided into five separate genera under the tribe  acacieae   the genus now called  acacia  represents the majority of the australian species and a few native to southeast asia  r  union  and pacific islands  most of the species outside australia  and a small number of australian species  are classified into  vachellia  and  senegalia   the two final genera   acaciella  and  mariosousa   each contain about a dozen species from the americas  but see  classification  below for the ongoing debate concerning their taxonomy  

this article describes acacias in the broader sense 

english botanist and gardener philip miller adopted the name  acacia  in       the generic name is derived from     the name given by early greek botanist physician pedanius dioscorides  middle to late first century  to the medicinal tree  a   nilotica  in his book  materia medica   this name derives from the ancient greek word for its characteristic thorns      thorn    the species name  nilotica  was given by linnaeus from this tree s best known range along the nile river  this became the type species of the genus 

the traditional circumscription of  acacia  eventually contained approximately       species  however  evidence began to accumulate that the genus as described was not monophyletic  queensland botanist les pedley proposed the subgenus  phyllodineae  be renamed  racosperma  and published the binomial names  this was taken up in new zealand but generally not followed in australia  where botanists declared more study was needed 
eventually  consensus emerged that  acacia  needed to be split as it was not monophyletic  this led to australian botanists bruce maslin and tony orchard pushing for the retypification of the genus with an australian species instead of the original african type species  an exception to traditional rules of priority that required ratification by the international botanical congress  that decision has been controversial  and debate continued  with some taxonomists  and many other biologists  deciding to continue to use the traditional  acacia sensu lato  circumscription of the genus  in defiance of decisions by an international botanical congress  however  a second international botanical congress has now confirmed the decision to apply the name  acacia  to the mostly australian plants  which some had been calling  racosperma   and which had formed the overwhelming majority of  acacia sensu lato   debate continues regarding the traditional acacias of africa  possibly placed in  senegalia  and  vachellia   and some of the american species  possibly placed in  acaciella  and  mariosousa  

acacias belong to the subfamily mimosoideae  the major clades of which may have formed in response to drying trends and fire regimes that accompanied increased seasonality during the late oligocene to early miocene         mya   pedley         following vassal         viewed acacia as comprising three large subgenera  but subsequently        raised the rank of these groups to genera acacia   senegalia    s l    and  racosperma   which was underpinned by later genetic studies 

in common parlance  the term  acacia  is occasionally applied to species of the genus  robinia   which also belongs in the pea family   robinia pseudoacacia   an american species locally known as black locust  is sometimes called  false acacia  in cultivation in the united kingdom and throughout europe 

the leaves of acacias are compound pinnate in general  in some species  however  more especially in the australian and pacific islands species  the leaflets are suppressed  and the leaf stalks  petioles  become vertically flattened in order to serve the purpose of leaves  these are known as  phyllodes   the vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight since with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light as fully as horizontally placed leaves  a few species  such as  acacia glaucoptera   lack leaves or phyllodes altogether but instead possess cladodes  modified leaf like photosynthetic stems functioning as leaves 

the small flowers have five very small petals  almost hidden by the long stamens  and are arranged in dense  globular or cylindrical clusters  they are yellow or cream colored in most species  whitish in some  or even purple   acacia purpureopetala   or red   acacia leprosa   scarlet blaze     acacia  flowers can be distinguished from those of a large related genus   albizia   by their stamens  which are not joined at the base  also  unlike individual  mimosa  flowers  those of  acacia  have more than ten stamens 

the plants often bear spines  especially those species growing in arid regions  these sometimes represent branches that have become short  hard  and pungent  though they sometimes represent leaf stipules   acacia armata  is the kangaroo thorn of australia  and  acacia erioloba   syn   acacia eriolobata   is the camelthorn of africa 

acacia seeds can be difficult to germinate  research has found that immersing the seeds in various temperatures  usually around       c         f   and manual seed coat chipping can improve growth to around     

in the central american bullthorn acacias    acacia sphaerocephala    acacia cornigera  and  acacia collinsii      some of the spiny stipules are large  swollen and hollow  these afford shelter for several species of  pseudomyrmex  ants  which feed on extrafloral nectaries on the leaf stalk and small lipid rich food bodies at the tips of the leaflets called beltian bodies  in return  the ants add protection to the plant against herbivores  some species of ants will also remove competing plants around the acacia  cutting off the offending plants  leaves with their jaws and ultimately killing them  other associated ant species appear to do nothing to benefit their hosts 

similar mutualisms with ants occur on  acacia  trees in africa  such as the whistling thorn acacia  the acacias provide shelter for ants in similar swollen stipules and nectar in extrafloral nectaries for their symbiotic ants  such as  crematogaster mimosae   in turn  the ants protect the plant by attacking large mammalian herbivores and stem boring beetles that damage the plant 

the predominantly herbivorous spider  bagheera kiplingi   which is found in central america and mexico  feeds on nubs at the tips of the acacia leaves  known as beltian bodies  which contain high concentrations of protein  these nubs are produced by the acacia as part of a symbiotic relationship with certain species of ant  which also eat them 

in australia   acacia  species are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus  aenetus  including  a   ligniveren   these burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down  other lepidoptera larvae which have been recorded feeding on  acacia  include brown tail   endoclita malabaricus  and turnip moth  the leaf mining larvae of some bucculatricid moths also feed on  acacia    bucculatrix agilis  feeds exclusively on  acacia horrida  and  bucculatrix flexuosa  feeds exclusively on  acacia nilotica  

acacias contain a number of organic compounds that defend them from pests and grazing animals 

acacia seeds are often used for food and a variety of other products 

in myanmar  laos  and thailand  the feathery shoots of  acacia pennata   common name  cha om                and  su pout ywet  in burmese  are used in soups  curries  omelettes  and stir fries 

various species of acacia yield gum  true gum arabic is the product of  acacia senegal   abundant in dry tropical west africa from senegal to northern nigeria 

 acacia nilotica   syn   acacia arabica   is the gum arabic tree of india  but yields a gum inferior to the true gum arabic  gum arabic is used in a wide variety of food products  including some soft drinks and confections 

the ancient egyptians used acacia gum in paints 

the gum of  acacia xanthophloea  and  acacia karroo  has a high sugar content and is sought out by the lesser bushbaby   acacia karroo  gum was once used for making confectionery and traded under the name  cape gum   it was also used medicinally to treat cattle suffering poisoning by  moraea  species 

 acacia  species have possible uses in folk medicine  a   th century ethiopian medical text describes a potion made from an ethiopian species  known as  grar   mixed with the root of the  tacha   then boiled  as a cure for rabies 

an astringent medicine high in tannins  called catechu or cutch  is procured from several species  but more especially from  senegalia catechu   syn   acacia catechu    by boiling down the wood and evaporating the solution so as to get an extract  the catechu extract from  a  catechu  figures in the history of chemistry in giving its name to the catechin  catechol  and catecholamine chemical families ultimately derived from it 

a few species are widely grown as ornamentals in gardens  the most popular perhaps is  a  dealbata   silver wattle   with its attractive glaucous to silvery leaves and bright yellow flowers  it is erroneously known as  mimosa  in some areas where it is cultivated  through confusion with the related genus  mimosa  

another ornamental acacia is the fever tree  southern european florists use  a  baileyana    a  dealbata    a  pycnantha  and  a  retinodes  as cut flowers and the common name there for them is mimosa 

ornamental species of acacias are also used by homeowners and landscape architects for home security  the sharp thorns of some species are a deterrent to trespassing  and may prevent break ins if planted under windows and near drainpipes  the aesthetic characteristics of acacia plants  in conjunction with their home security qualities  makes them a reasonable alternative to constructed fences and walls 

 acacia farnesiana  is used in the perfume industry due to its strong fragrance  the use of acacia as a fragrance dates back centuries 

acacia also supposed to have been used for zulu warriors  iziqu  or isiku  beads  which passed on through sir robert baden powell to the boy scout movement s wood badge training award 

egyptian mythology has associated the acacia tree with characteristics of the tree of life  such as in the myth of osiris and isis 

several parts  mainly bark  root  and resin  of  acacia  species are used to make incense for rituals  acacia is used in incense mainly in india  nepal  and china including in its tibet region  smoke from acacia bark is thought to keep demons and ghosts away and to put the gods in a good mood  roots and resin from acacia are combined with rhododendron  acorus  cytisus  salvia  and some other components of incense  both people and elephants like an alcoholic beverage made from acacia fruit 
according to easton s bible dictionary  the acacia tree may be the    burning bush     exodus      which moses encountered in the desert  also  when god gave moses the instructions for building the tabernacle  he said to  make an ark  and  a table of acacia wood   exodus             revised standard version   also  in the christian tradition  christ s crown of thorns is thought to have been woven from acacia 

in russia  italy  and other countries  it is customary to present women with yellow mimosas  among other flowers  on international women s day  march     these  mimosas  may be from  a  dealbata   silver wattle  

the bark of various australian species  known as wattles  is very rich in tannin and forms an important article of export  important species include  a  pycnantha   golden wattle    a  decurrens   tan wattle    a  dealbata   silver wattle  and  a  mearnsii   black wattle  

black wattle is grown in plantations in south africa and south america  most australian  acacia  species introduced to south africa have become an enormous problem  due to their naturally aggressive propagation  the pods of  a  nilotica   under the name of  neb neb    and of other african species  are also rich in tannin and used by tanners  in yemen  the principal tannin substance was derived from the leaves of the salam tree   acacia etbaica    a tree known locally by the name  qara       garadh    a bath solution of the crushed leaves of this tree  into which raw leather had been inserted for prolonged soaking  would take only    days for curing  the water and leaves  however  required changing after seven or eight days  and the leather needed to be turned over daily 

some  acacia  species are valuable as timber  such as  a  melanoxylon   blackwood  from australia  which attains a great size  its wood is used for furniture  and takes a high polish  and  a  omalophylla   myall wood  also australian   which yields a fragrant timber used for ornaments   a  seyal  is thought to be the shittah tree of the bible  which supplied shittim wood  according to the book of exodus  this was used in the construction of the ark of the covenant   a  koa  from the hawaiian islands and  a  heterophylla  from r  union are both excellent timber trees  depending on abundance and regional culture  some  acacia  species  e g   a  fumosa   are traditionally used locally as firewoods  it is also used to make homes for different animals 

in indonesia  mainly in sumatra  and in malaysia  mainly in sabah   plantations of  a  mangium  are being established to supply pulpwood to the paper industry 

acacia wood pulp gives high opacity and below average bulk paper  this is suitable in lightweight offset papers used for bibles and dictionaries  it is also used in paper tissue where it improves softness 

acacias can be planted for erosion control  especially after mining or construction damage 

for the same reasons it is favored as an erosion control plant  with its easy spreading and resilience  some varieties of acacia are potentially invasive species  one of the most globally significant invasive acacias is black wattle  a  mearnsii   which is taking over grasslands and abandoned agricultural areas worldwide  especially in moderate coastal and island regions where mild climate promotes its spread  australian new zealand weed risk assessment gives it a  high risk  score of     rating and it is considered one of the world s     most invasive species 
extensive ecological studies should be performed before further introduction of acacia varieties  as this fast growing genus  once introduced  spreads quickly and is extremely difficult to eradicate 

nineteen different species of  acacia  in the americas contain cyanogenic glycosides  which  if exposed to an enzyme which specifically splits glycosides  can release hydrogen cyanide  hcn  in the  leaves   this sometimes results in the poisoning death of livestock 

if fresh plant material spontaneously produces     ppm or more hcn  then it is potentially toxic  this corresponds to about       mol hcn per gram of fresh plant material  it turns out that  if acacia  leaves  lack the specific glycoside splitting enzyme  then they may be less toxic than otherwise  even those containing significant quantities of cyanic glycosides 

some  acacia  species containing cyanogens include  acacia erioloba    a  cunninghamii    a  obtusifolia    a  sieberiana   and  a  sieberiana  var   woodii 

the arbre du t  n  r   in niger was the most isolated tree in the world  about from any other tree  the tree was knocked down by a truck driver in      

in nairobi  kenya  the thorn tree caf   is named after a naivasha thorn tree   acacia xanthophloea   in its centre  travelers used to pin notes to others to the thorns of the tree  the current tree is the third of the same variety 






acapulco

acapulco de ju  rez     commonly called acapulco  is a city  municipality and major seaport in the state of guerrero on the pacific coast of mexico  south of mexico city  acapulco is located on a deep  semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of mexico s history  it is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between panama and san francisco  california  united states  the city of acapulco is the largest in the state  far larger than the state capital chilpancingo  acapulco is also mexico s largest beach and balneario resort city 

the city is one of mexico s oldest beach resorts  which came into prominence in the     s through to the     s as a getaway for hollywood stars and millionaires  acapulco was once a popular tourist resort  but due to a massive upsurge in gang violence and murder since      it no longer attracts many foreign tourists  and most now only come from mexico itself  it is the deadliest city in mexico and the third deadliest city in the world  and the us government has warned its citizens not to travel there  in      there were     murders  and the homicide rate was one of the highest in the world      in every          in september      the city s entire police force was disarmed by the military  due to suspicions that it has been infiltrated by drugs gangs  a health crisis has developed due to large quantities of uncollected refuse building up in the streets 

the resort area is divided into three parts  the north end of the bay and beyond is the  traditional  area  which encompasses the area from  parque papagayo  through the z  calo and onto the beaches of  caleta  and  caletilla   the main part of the bay known as  zona dorada    golden zone  in spanish   where the famous in the mid   th century vacationed  and the south end   diamante    diamond  in spanish   which is dominated by newer luxury high rise hotels and condominiums 

the name  acapulco  comes from nahuatl language  aca p  l co   and means  where the reeds were destroyed or washed away   the  de ju  rez  was added to the official name in      to honor benito ju  rez  former president of mexico                the seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane  the island and municipality of capul  in the philippines  derives its name from acapulco  capul was the western end of the trans pacific sailing route from acapulco to what was then a spanish colony 

by the  th century around the acapulco bay area  there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the olmecs  then by a number of others during the pre hispanic period and before it ended in the     s  at acapulco bay itself  there were two olmec sites  one by playa larga and the other on a hill known as  el guitarr  n   olmec influence caused the small spread out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers 

later  teotihuacan influence made its way here via cuernavaca and chilpancingo  then mayan influence arrived from the isthmus of tehuantepec and through what is now oaxaca  this history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here  especially at  playa hornos  pie de la cuesta  and  tambuco  

in the   th century  new waves of migration of nahuas and  coixas  came through here  these people were the antecedents of the aztecs  in the later   th century  after four years of military struggle  acapulco became part of the aztec empire during the reign of ahuizotl                it was annexed to a tributary province named  tepecuacuilco   however  this was only transitory  as the aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city s outskirts  the city was on territory under control of the  yopes   who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the spanish in the     s 

there are two stories about how acapulco bay was discovered by europeans  the first states that two years after the spanish conquest of the aztec empire  hern  n cort  s sent explorers west to find gold  the explorers had subdued this area after       and captain saavedra cer  n was authorized by cort  s to found a settlement here  the other states that the bay was discovered on december          by a small ship named the el tepache santiago captained by santiago guevara 
the first encomendero was established in      at  cacahuatepec   which is part of the modern acapulco municipality  in       a number of spaniards  most notably juan rodriguez de villafuerte  left the oaxaca coast and founded the village of villafuerte where the city of acapulco now stands  villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples  and this eventually resulted in the yopa rebellion in the region of  cuautepec   hern  n cort  s was obligated to send vasco porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions  the province of acapulco became the encomendero of rodriguez de villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa  cotton and corn 

cort  s established acapulco as a major port by the early     s  with the first major road between mexico city and the port constructed by       the wharf  named marqu  s  was constructed by      between bruja point and diamond point  soon after  the area was made an  alcadia   major province or town  

spanish trade in the far east would give acapulco a prominent position in the economy of new spain  galleons started arriving here from asia by       and in that year thirty spanish families were sent to live here from mexico city to have a permanent base of european residents  acapulco would become the second most important port  after veracruz  due to its direct trade with the philippines  this trade would focus on the yearly manila acapulco galleon trade  which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between new spain  europe and asia  in       the port was granted the monopoly of the manila trade 

the galleon trade made its yearly run from the mid   th century until the early   th  the luxury items it brought to new spain attracted the attention of english and dutch pirates  such as francis drake  henry morgan and thomas cavendish  who called it  the black ship   a dutch fleet invaded acapulco in       destroying much of the town before being driven off  the fort of san diego was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships  the fort was destroyed by an earthquake in      and was rebuilt between      and      
at the beginning of the   th century  king charles iv declared acapulco a ciudad official and it became an essential part of the spanish crown  however  not long after  the mexican war of independence began  in       jos   mar  a morelos y pav  n attacked and burnt down the city  after he defeated royalist commander francisco par  s at the battle of tres palos  the independence of mexico in      ended the run of the manila galleon 
acapulco s importance as a port recovered during the california gold rush in the mid   th century  with ships going to and coming from panama stopping here  this city was the besieged on    april      by antonio l  pez de santa anna after guerrero s leadership had rebelled by issuing the plan de ayutla  after an unsuccessful week of fighting  santa anna retreated 

in       revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of acapulco 
in       the prince of wales  the future king edward viii  visited the area  impressed by what he saw  he recommended the place to his compatriots in europe  making it popular with the elite there  much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by an east texas businessman named albert b  pullen from corrigan  texas  in the area now known as old acapulco  in      carlos barnard started the first section of  hotel el mirador   with    rooms on the cliffs of la quebrada  wolf schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and albert pullen built the  las americas hotel  

in the mid     s  the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built  in the early     s  president miguel alem  n vald  s upgraded the port s infrastructure  installing electrical lines  drainage systems  roads and the first highway to connect the port with mexico city 

the economy grew and foreign investment increased with it  during the     s  acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire hollywood stars such as elizabeth taylor  frank sinatra  eddie fisher and brigitte bardot  the      hollywood movie  fun in acapulco   starring elvis presley  is set in acapulco although the filming took place in the usa  former swing musician teddy stauffer  so called  mister acapulco   was a hotel manager   villa vera    casablanca    who attracted many celebrities to acapulco 

from a population of only       or       in the     s  by the early     s  acapulco had a population of about         in       the diocese of acapulco was created by pope pius xii  it became an archdiocese in      

during the     s and     s  new hotel resorts were built  and accommodation and transport were made cheaper  it was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in acapulco  the foreign and mexican middle class could now afford to travel here  however  as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay  the old hotels of the     s lost their grandeur  for the      summer olympics in neighboring mexico city  acapulco hosted the sailing  then yachting  events 

in the     s  there was a significant expansion of the port 

the miss universe      pageant took place in the city  in       singer songwriter juan gabriel wrote the song  amor eterno   which pays homage to acapulco  the song was first and most famously recorded by rocio durcal  additionally  acapulco is the hometown of actress  singer  and comedian a  da pierce  who found fame during the     s      s and the first decade of the   st century 

during the     s  the tollway known as the  ruta del sol  was built  crossing the mountains between mexico city and acapulco  the journey takes only about three and a half hours  making acapulco a favorite weekend destination for mexico city inhabitants  it was in that time period that the economic impact of acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively and as a result a new type of services emerged like the colegio nautilus  this educational project  backed by the state government  was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children 

the port continued to grow and in       a new private company  api acapulco  was created to manage operations  this consolidated operations and now acapulco is the major port for car exports to the pacific 
the city was devastated by hurricane pauline in       the storm stranded tourists and left more than     dead in the city  most of the victims were from the shantytowns built on steep hillsides that surround the city  other victims were swept away by thirty foot waves and winds  the main road  avenida costera  became a fast moving three foot deep river of sludge 

in the   st century  the mexican drug war has had a negative effect on tourism in acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the guerrero coast route that brings drugs from south america as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since      

a major gun battle between    gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of      in the old acapulco seaside area  lasting hours and killing    of the gunmen and two soldiers  this came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the mexican economy  forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back  however  hotel occupancy for      was down five percent from the year before  the death of arturo beltran leyva in december      resulted in infighting among different groups within the beltran leyva cartel 

gang violence continued to plague acapulco through      and into       most notably with at least    dying in drug related violence on march           and another    deaths on january          among the first incident s dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex mayor  in the second incident  the headless bodies of    young men were found dumped near the plaza senderos shopping center  on august           mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in acapulco  three of which were placed in the city s main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces 

on february          six spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six spanish women with them were gang raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of acapulco  though after these accusations  none of the victims decided to press charges  on september           mexican politician braulio zaragoza was gunned down at the  el mirador  hotel in the city  he was the leader of the conservative opposition national action party  pan  in southern guerrero state  several politicians have been targeted by drug cartels operating in the area  investigations are under way  but no arrests have yet been made  the insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists  it was stated by the  direcci  n general de aeron  utica civil  that the number of international flyers coming to acapulco decreased from         flyers registered in      to        flyers in the year       the number of international tourists flying to acapulco dropped     in the interval of nine years 
the city  located on the pacific coast of mexico in the state of guerrero  is classified as one of the state s seven regions  dividing the rest of the guerrero coast into the costa grande and the costa chica 
forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain  another forty percent is semi flat  and the other twenty percent is flat  altitude varies from sea level to   the highest peaks are  potrero  san nicolas   and  alto camar  n   there is one major river  the  papagayo   which runs through the municipality  along with a number of  arroyos   streams   there are also two small lagoons  tres palos and coyuca  along with a number of thermal springs 

acapulco features a tropical wet and dry climate  k  ppen  aw   hot with distinct wet and dry seasons  with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in mexico  but this varies depending on altitude  the warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is  tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from may through november  the forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season  with evergreen pines in the highest elevations  fauna consists mostly of deer  small mammals  a wide variety of both land and seabirds  and marine animals such as turtles 

the temperature of the sea is quite stable  with lows of between january     march  and a high of in august 

as the seat of a municipality  the city of acapulco is the government authority for over     other communities  which together have a territory of           km  this municipality borders the municipalities of chilpancingo  juan r escudero  tierra colorada   san marcos  coyuca de ben  tez with the pacific ocean to the south 

the metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of acapulco de ju  rez and coyuca de benitez  the area has a population    of         

acapulco is the most populated city in the state of guerrero  according to the results of the ii population and housing census      carried out by the national institute of statistics and geography  inegi  with a census date of june           the city had until then a total population of         inhabitants  of that amount          were men and         women  it is considered the twenty second most populous city in mexico and the tenth most populous metropolitan area in mexico  it is also the city with the highest concentration of population of the homonymous municipality  representing       percent of the         inhabitants 

the metropolitan area of acapulco is made up of six towns in the municipality of acapulco de ju  rez and four in the municipality of coyuca de ben  tez  in agreement with the last count and official delimitation realized in      altogether by the national institute of statistics and geography  the national council of population and the secretariat of social development  the metropolitan area of acapulco grouped a total of         inhabitants in a surface of          km    which placed it as the tenth most populated district in mexico  it is estimated according to a study by the national autonomous university of mexico on climate and geography  carried out in       that between      and      the city of acapulco will exceed one million inhabitants 


tourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on acapulco bay  about seventy three percent of the municipality s population is involved in commerce  most of it related to tourism and the port  mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture  industrial production is limited mostly to bottling  milk products  cement products  and ice and energy production  agricultural products include tomatoes  corn  watermelon  beans  green chili peppers  and melons 

acapulco is one of mexico s oldest coastal tourist destinations  reaching prominence in the     s as the place where hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale  in modern times  tourists in acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail 

the city is divided into three tourist areas 

traditional acapulco is the old part of the port  where hotels like hotel los flamingos  owned by personalities johnny weissmuller and john wayne are located  is on the northern end of the bay  anchored by attractions such as the beaches of caleta and caletilla  the cliff divers of la quebrada  and the city square  known as  el zocalo   the heyday of this part of acapulco ran from the late   s until the   s  starting in the late   s  and with development continuing through the   s 

acapulco dorado had its development between the     s and the     s  and is about    minutes from the acapulco international airport  it is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port  runs through much of the acapulco bay  from icacos  passing through costera miguel aleman avenue  which is the main one  to papagayo park  it has several hotels and availability in them 
acapulco diamante  also known as punta diamante  is the newest and most developed and investment part of the port  consisting of exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains  residential complexes  luxury condominiums and private villas  spas  restaurants  shopping areas and a golf course all the above makes it one of the most exclusive places in the country  starts on the scenic highway in las brisas  includes puerto marqu  s and punta diamante and extends to barra vieja beach  it is    minutes from the acapulco international airport 

acapulco diamante  also known as punta diamante  is the newest and most developed and investment part of the port  consisting of exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains  residential complexes  luxury condominiums and private villas  spas  restaurants  shopping areas and a golf course  connected by the highway  la escenica   includes playa diamante and puerto marqu  s  and stretches from the airport to the mountains that separates it from the bay  in this area  all along  boulevard de las naciones   almost all transportation is by car  limousine or golf cart  the older section of town now caters to mostly middle class  almost exclusively mexican clientele  while the glitzier newer section caters to the mexican upper classes  many of whom never venture into the older  traditional part of town 

acapulco s reputation of a high energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists  from november to april  luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the ms  queen victoria   the ms  rotterdam    crystal harmony   and all the princess line ships  despite acapulco s international fame  most of its visitors are from central mexico  especially the affluent from mexico city  acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the mexican cruise line ocean star cruises 

for the christmas season of       acapulco received         visitors  most of whom are mexican nationals  adding     million pesos to the economy  eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air  the area has over        condominiums  most of which function as second homes for their mexican owners  acapulco is still popular with mexican celebrities and the wealthy  such as luis miguel  pl  cido domingo  and dolores olmedo  who maintain homes here 

while much of the glitz and glamour that made acapulco famous still remains  from the latter   th century on  the city has also taken on other less positive reputations  some consider it a  pass    resort  eclipsed by the newer canc  n and cabo san lucas  over the years  a number of problems have developed here  especially in the bay and the older sections of the city  the large number of wandering vendors on the beaches  who offer everything from newspapers to massages  are a recognized problem  it is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach  but the government says it is difficult to eradicate  as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here  around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides  populated by migrants who have come here looking for work  in the last decade  drug related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade 

another problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay  although       tons have recently been extracted from the bays of acapulco and nearby zihuatanejo  more needs to be done  most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them  however  the center of the bay is not touched  the reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets  rivers and the bay itself  the most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires  acapulco has seen some success in this area  having several beaches receiving the high  blue flag  certifications for cleanliness and water quality 

acapulco s gastronomy is very rich  the following are typical dishes from the region 
relleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes  raisins  carrots and chiles  it is eaten with bread called  bolillo  
pozole is a soup with a salsa base  it can be white  red or green   corn  meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with  antojitos   snacks  like tostadas  tacos and tamales  this dish is served as part of a weekly thursday event in the city and the state  with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment  from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators 

acapulco s main attraction is its nightlife  as it has been for many decades  nightclubs change names and owners frequently 
for example  baby    o has been open to the national and international public since      and different celebrities have visited their installations such as mexican singer luis miguel  bono from u  and sylvester stallone  another nightclub is palladium  located in the esc  nica avenue  the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the santa lucia bay at night  various djs have had performances in palladium among them dvbbs  tom swoon  nervo and junkie kid 

informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment  in addition  there is the beach bar zone  where younger crowds go  these are located along the costera road  face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock  most are concentrated between the fiesta americana and continental plaza hotels  these places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress  there is a bungee jump in this area as well 
another enigmatic attraction at acapulco are the la quebrada cliff divers  the tradition started in the     s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below  eventually  locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive  today the divers are professionals  diving from heights of into an inlet that is only wide and deep  after praying first at a shrine to the virgin of guadalupe  on december     the feast day of this virgin  freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her  dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the  ocean of fire  when the sea is lit with gasoline  making a circle of flames which the diver aims for  the spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the hotel plaza las glorias el mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace 

there are a number of beaches in the acapulco bay and the immediate coastline  in the bay proper there are the la angosta  in the quebrada   caleta  caletilla  dominguillo  tlacopanocha  hornos  hornitos  honda  tamarindo  condesa  guitarr  n  icacos  playuela  playuelilla and playa del secreto  in the adjoining  smaller bay of puerto marqu  s there is pichilingue  las brisas  and playa roqueta  facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is pie de la cuesta and southeast are playa revolcadero  playa aeromar  playa encantada and barra vieja  two lagoons are in the area  coyuca to the northwest of acapulco bay and tres palos to the southeast  both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours  tres palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected 

in addition to sunbathing  the beaches around the bay offer a number of services  such as boat rentals  boat tours  horseback riding  scuba diving and other aquatic sports  one popular cruise is from caletilla beach to roqueta island  which has places to snorkel  have lunch  and a lighthouse  there is also an underwater statue of the virgin of guadalupe here  created in      by armando quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here  many of the scuba diving tours come to this area as well  where there are sunken ships  sea mountains  and cave rock formations  another popular activity is deep sea fishing  the major attraction is sail fishing  fish caught here have weighed between    and      pounds  sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything  the trip is free 

in the old part of the city  there is a traditional main square called the z  calo  lined with shade trees  caf  s and shops  at the north end of the square is  nuestra se  ora de la soledad  cathedral  with blue onion shaped domes and byzantine towers  the building was originally constructed as a movie set  but was later adapted into a church  acapulco s most historic building is the fort of san diego  located east of the main square and originally built in      to protect the city from pirate attacks  the fort was partially destroyed by the dutch in the mid   th century  rebuilt  then destroyed again in      by an earthquake  it was rebuilt again by      and this is the building that can be seen today  unchanged except for renovations done to it in       parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements  today the fort serves as the museo hist  rico de acapulco  acapulco historical museum   which shows the port s history from the pre hispanic period until independence  there are temporary exhibits as well 
the  centro internacional de convivencia infantil  or cici is a sea life and aquatic park located on costera miguel aleman  it offers wave pools  water slides and water toboggans  there are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program  the center mostly caters to children  another place that is popular with children is the  parque papagayo   a large family park which has life sized replicas of a spanish galleon and the space shuttle columbia  three artificial lakes  an aviary  a skating rink  rides  go karts and more 

the dolores olmedo house is located in the traditional downtown of acapulco and is noted for the murals by diego rivera that adorn it  olmedo and rivera had been friend since olmedo was a child and rivera spent the last two years of his life here  during that time  he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics  featuring aztec deities such as quetzalcoatl  the interior of the home is covered in murals  the home is not a museum  so only the outside murals can be seen by the public 

there is a small museum called  casa de la m  scara   house of masks  which is dedicated to masks  most of them from mexico  but there are examples from many parts of the world  the collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called masks of the world  mexico across history  the huichols and the jaguar  alebrijes  and dances of guerrero  devils and death  identity and fantasy  and afro indian masks 
the botanical garden of acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the universidad loyola del pac  fico  most of the plants here are native to the region  and many  such as the peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree  are in danger of extinction 

one cultural event that is held yearly in acapulco is the  festival internacional de la nao   which takes place in the fort of san diego  located near the z  calo in downtown of the city  the festival honors the remembrance of the city s interaction and trades with oriental territories which started back in the sixteenth century  the nao festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from india  china  japan  philippines  thailand  indonesia and south korea  the variety of events go from film projections  musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes  some of the events are specifically for kids 

the annual french festival takes place throughout acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between mexico and france  the main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair  the cin  polis galer  as diana and the teatro juan ru  z de alarc  n present french and french literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects  even some of the local nightclubs feature french djs  other festivals celebrated here include carnival  the feast of san isidro labrador on    may  and in november  a crafts and livestock fair called the nao de china 

there are a number of golf courses in acapulco including the acapulco princess and the pierre marqu  s course  the latter designed by robert trent jones in      for the world cup golf tournament  the mayan palace course was designed by pedro guericia and an economical course called the club de golf acapulco is near the convention center  the most exclusive course is that of the tres vidas golf club  designed by robert von hagge  it is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds 

another famous sport tournament that has been held in acapulco since      is the abierto mexicano telcel  a     atp that takes place in the tennis courts of the princess mundo imperial  a resort located in the diamante zone of acapulco  initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court  the event has gained popularity within the passing of the years  in      the tournament took place from the   th of february to the  th of march  the athletes who participated in the competition were some of the most famous players in the last couple of years  among them were novak djokovic currently ranked second  rafael nadal positioned sixth in the ranking and marin cilic who is the number eight in the ranking 
the prizes are us            for wta and us              for atp 

acapulco also has a bullring  called the plaza de toros  near caletilla beach  the season runs during the winter and is called the fiesta brava 
over         american teenagers and young adults travel to resort areas and balnearios throughout mexico during spring break each year  the main reason students head to mexico is the    year old drinking age  versus    for the united states   something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean  this has become attractive since the     s  especially since more traditional spring break places such as daytona beach  florida  have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors  this legislation has pushed spring break visitation to various parts of mexico  with acapulco as one of the top destinations 

in the late     s and early     s  canc  n had been favored as the spring break destination of choice  however  canc  n has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event  and students have been looking for someplace new  this has led many more to choose acapulco  in spite of the fact that for many travelers  the flight is longer and more expensive than to canc  n  many are attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and acapulco s famous nightlife  in              students came to acapulco for spring break  hotels did not get that many in       due mostly to the economic situation in the united states  and partially because of scares of drug related violence 

in february       the us state department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to acapulco  the warning   a result of violent activity springing from mexico s drug cartel d  b  cle   took college campuses by storm  with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to mexico over spring break  the new york times tracked the travels of a penn student on spring break in acapulco just a week after the dissemination of the email  while bill o reilly devoted a segment of his show   the o reilly factor   to urge students to stay away from acapulco  in june       a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government  these included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets  involving large caliber weapons and grenades  however  no incidents of violence against spring breakers were reported 

many airlines fly to acapulco international airport  in the city  there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place  but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations  however  an important mode of transportation is the government subsidized  colectivo  cab system  these cabs cost    pesos per person to ride  but they are not private  the driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available  and will transport them to their destination based on first come  first served rules  the colectivos each travel a designated area of the city  the three main ones being costera  colosio  coloso  or a mixture of the three  coloso cabs travel mainly to old acapulco  colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of acapulco  costera cabs drive up and down the coast of acapulco  where most of the hotels for visitors are located  but which includes some of old acapulco  where a driver will take you is partly his choice  some are willing to travel to the other designated areas  especially during slow periods of the day 

the bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider  as far as transportation goes  it is the cheapest form  other than walking  in acapulco  the most expensive buses have air conditioning  while the cheaper buses do not  for tourists  the acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with acapulco painted on the side of them  these buses are not for tourists only  but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems  these buses travel the tourist section of acapulco  driving up and down the coast  there are buses with specific routes and destinations  generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat  perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized  with decals and home made interior designs that range from comic book scenes  to pornography  and even to  hello kitty  themes 

the conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the   th of june      with the implementation of the acabus  the acabus infrastructure has a length of   counts with    stations that spread through the city of acapulco and   routes  this project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers 


in       the idea to nominate the manila acapulco galleon trade route was initiated by the mexican ambassador to unesco with the filipino ambassador to unesco 

an experts  roundtable meeting was held at the university of santo tomas  ust  on april          as part of the preparation of the philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the manila acapulco galleon trade route to the world heritage list  the nomination will be made jointly with mexico 

the following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting  dr  celestina boncan on the tornaviaje  dr  mary jane a  bolunia on shipyards in the bicol region  mr  sheldon clyde jago on  bobby orillaneda  and ligaya lacsina on underwater archaeology  dr  leovino garcia on maps and cartography  fr  rene javellana  s j  on fortifications in the philippines  felice sta  maria on food  dr  fernando zialcita on textile  and regalado trota jose on historical dimension  the papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route s outstanding universal value 

the mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route s nomination 

spain has also backed the nomination of the manila acapulco trade route route in the unesco world heritage list and has also suggested the archives of the manila acapulco galleons to be nominated as part of a separate unesco list  the unesco memory of the world register

alan kay

alan curtis kay  born may           is an american computer scientist  he has been elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences  the national academy of engineering  and the royal society of arts  he is best known for his pioneering work on object oriented programming and windowing graphical user interface design 

he is the president of the viewpoints research institute  and an adjunct professor of computer science at the university of california  los angeles  he is also on the advisory board of tti vanguard  until mid       he was a senior fellow at hp labs  a visiting professor at kyoto university  and an adjunct professor at the massachusetts institute of technology  mit  

kay is also a former professional jazz guitarist  composer  and theatrical designer  and an amateur classical pipe organist 

in an interview on education in america with the davis group ltd   kay said 

originally from springfield  massachusetts  kay s family relocated several times due to his father s career in physiology before ultimately settling in the new york metropolitan area when he was nine 

he attended the prestigious brooklyn technical high school  where he was suspended due to insubordination in his senior year  having already accumulated enough credits to graduate  kay then attended bethany college in bethany  west virginia  he majored in biology and minored in mathematics before he was asked to leave by the administration for protesting the institution s jewish quota 

thereafter  kay taught guitar in denver  colorado for a year and hastily enlisted in the united states air force when the local draft board inquired about his nonstudent status  assigned as a computer programmer  a rare billet dominated by women due to the secretarial connotations of the field in the era  after passing an aptitude test  he devised an early cross platform file transfer system 

following his discharge  kay enrolled at the university of colorado boulder  earning a bachelor s degree in mathematics and molecular biology in       before and during this time  he worked as a professional jazz guitarist  during his studies at cu  he wrote the music for an adaptation of  the hobbit  and other campus theatricals 

in the autumn of       he began graduate school at the university of utah college of engineering  he earned an m s  in electrical engineering in      before taking his ph d  in computer science in       his doctoral dissertation   flex  a flexible extendable language   described the invention of a computer language known as flex  while at utah  he worked with  father of computer graphics  ivan sutherland  best known for writing such pioneering programs as sketchpad  this greatly inspired kay s evolving views on objects and programming  as he grew busier with arpa research  he ended his musical career 

in       he met seymour papert and learned of the logo programming language  a dialect of lisp optimized for educational purposes  this led him to learn of the work of jean piaget  jerome bruner  lev vygotsky  and of constructionist learning  further influencing his professional orientation 

leaving utah as an associate professor of computer science in       kay became a visiting researcher at the stanford artificial intelligence laboratory in anticipation of accepting a professorship at carnegie mellon university  instead  in       he joined the xerox parc research staff in palo alto  california  throughout the decade  he developed prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language smalltalk  these inventions were later commercialized by apple in their lisa and macintosh computers 

kay is one of the fathers of the idea of object oriented programming  which he named  along with some colleagues at parc  some of the original object oriented concepts  including the use of the words  object  and  class   had been developed for simula    at the norwegian computing center  later he said 

i m sorry that i long ago coined the term  objects  for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea  the big idea is  messaging 

while at parc  kay conceived the dynabook concept  a key progenitor of laptop and tablet computers and the e book  he is also the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface  gui   because the dynabook was conceived as an educational platform  kay is considered to be one of the first researchers into mobile learning  many features of the dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the one laptop per child educational platform  with which kay is actively involved 

the field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen  according to kay  in which educational communities  parents  and children will not see in it a set of tools invented by douglas engelbart  but a medium in the marshall mcluhan sense  he wrote 

as with simulas leading to oop  this encounter finally hit me with what the destiny of personal computing really was going to be  not a personal dynamic vehicle  as in engelbart s metaphor opposed to the ibm  railroads   but something much more profound  a personal dynamic medium  with a vehicle one could wait until high school and give  drivers ed   but if it was a medium  it had to extend into the world of childhood 

from      to       kay was atari s chief scientist  he became an apple fellow in       following the closure of the company s advanced technology group in       he was recruited by his friend bran ferren  head of research and development at disney  to join walt disney imagineering as a disney fellow  he remained there until ferren left to start applied minds inc with imagineer danny hillis  leading to the cessation of the fellows program  in       he founded viewpoints research institute  a non profit organization dedicated to children  learning  and advanced software development  for its first ten years  kay and his viewpoints group were based at applied minds in glendale  california  where he and ferren continued to work together on various projects  kay was also a senior fellow at hewlett packard until hp disbanded the advanced software research team on july          

kay taught a fall      class   powerful ideas  useful tools to understand the world   at new york university s interactive telecommunications program  itp  along with full time itp faculty member nancy hechinger  the goal of the class was to devise new forms of teaching learning based on fundamental  powerful concepts rather than traditional rote learning 

in december       while still at apple  kay collaborated with many others to start the open source squeak version of smalltalk  and he continues to work on it  as part of this effort  in november       his team began research on what became the etoys system  more recently he started  along with david a  smith  david p  reed  andreas raab  rick mcgeer  julian lombardi and mark mccahill  the croquet project  an open source networked  d and  d environment for collaborative work 

in       it became clear that the etoy architecture in squeak had reached its limits in what the morphic interface infrastructure could do  andreas raab was a researcher working in kay s group  then at hewlett packard  he proposed defining a  script process  and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoids several more general problems  the result was a new user interface  proposed to replace the squeak morphic user interface in the future  tweak added mechanisms of islands  asynchronous messaging  players and costumes  language extensions  projects  and tile scripting  its underlying object system is class based  but to users  during programming  it acts like it is prototype based  tweak objects are created and run in tweak project windows 

in november       at the world summit on the information society  the mit research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer  for educational use around the world  it has many names  the      laptop  the one laptop per child program  the children s machine  and the xo    the program was begun and is sustained by kay s friend  nicholas negroponte  and is based on kay s dynabook ideal  kay is a prominent co developer of the computer  focusing on its educational software using squeak and etoys 

kay has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new  and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented  lectures at oopsla      conference and his acm turing award talk  entitled  the computer revolution hasn t happened yet  were informed by his experiences with sketchpad  simula  smalltalk  and the bloated code of commercial software 

on august           kay s proposal to the united states national science foundation  nsf  was granted  thus funding viewpoints research institute for several years  the proposal title was   steps toward the reinvention of programming   a compact and practical model of personal computing as a self exploratorium  a sense of what kay is trying to do comes from this quote  from the abstract of a seminar on this given at intel research labs  berkeley   the conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days  we wonder  how small could be an understandable practical  model t  design that covers this functionality   m lines of code     k loc     k loc    k loc  

alan kay has received many awards and honors  among them 

his other honors include the j d warnier prix d informatique  the acm systems software award  the nec computers   communication foundation prize  the funai foundation prize  the lewis branscomb technology award  and the acm sigcse award for outstanding contributions to computer science education 






apl  programming language 

apl  named after the book  a programming language   is a programming language developed in the     s by kenneth e  iverson  its central datatype is the multidimensional array  it uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators  leading to very concise code  it has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling  spreadsheets  functional programming  and computer math packages  it has also inspired several other programming languages 

a mathematical notation for manipulating arrays was developed by kenneth e  iverson  starting in      at harvard university  in       he began work for ibm where he developed this notation with adin falkoff and published it in his book  a programming language  in       the preface states its premise 
this notation was used inside ibm for short research reports on computer systems  such as the burroughs b     and its stack mechanism when stack machines versus register machines were being evaluated by ibm for upcoming computers 

iverson also used his notation in a draft of the chapter  a programming language   written for a book he was writing with fred brooks   automatic data processing   which would be published in      

in       iverson received the turing award for his work on apl 

as early as       the first attempt to use the notation to describe a complete computer system happened after falkoff discussed with william c  carter his work to standardize the instruction set for the machines that later became the ibm system     family 

in       herbert hellerman  working at the ibm systems research institute  implemented a part of the notation on an ibm      computer  and it was used by students in a special high school course on calculating transcendental functions by series summation  students tested their code in hellerman s lab  this implementation of a part of the notation was called personalized array translator  pat  

in       falkoff  iverson  and edward h  sussenguth jr   all working at ibm  used the notation for a formal description of the ibm system     series machine architecture and functionality  which resulted in a paper published in  ibm systems journal  in       after this was published  the team turned their attention to an implementation of the notation on a computer system  one of the motivations for this focus of implementation was the interest of john l  lawrence who had new duties with science research associates  an educational company bought by ibm in       lawrence asked iverson and his group to help use the language as a tool to develop and use computers in education 

after lawrence m  breed and philip s  abrams of stanford university joined the team at ibm research  they continued their prior work on an implementation programmed in fortran iv for a part of the notation which had been done for the ibm      computer running on the ibsys operating system  this work was finished in late      and later named ivsys  for iverson system   the basis of this implementation was described in detail by abrams in a stanford university technical report   an interpreter for iverson notation  in       the academic aspect of this was formally supervised by niklaus wirth  like hellerman s pat system earlier  this implementation did not include the apl character set but used special english reserved words for functions and operators  the system was later adapted for a time sharing system and  by november       it had been reprogrammed for the ibm system     model    computer running in a time sharing mode and was used internally at ibm 

a key development in the ability to use apl effectively  before the wide use of cathode ray tube  crt  terminals  was the development of a special ibm selectric typewriter interchangeable typing element with all the special apl characters on it  this was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the selectric typewriter and typing element mechanism  such as the ibm      and ibm      terminal  keycaps could be placed over the normal keys to show which apl characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck  for the first time  a programmer could type in and see proper apl characters as used in iverson s notation and not be forced to use awkward english keyword representations of them  falkoff and iverson had the special apl selectric typing elements      and      designed in late       although no apl computer system was available to use them  iverson cited falkoff as the inspiration for the idea of using an ibm selectric typing element for the apl character set 

many apl symbols  even with the apl characters on the selectric typing element  still had to be typed in by over striking two extant element characters  an example is the  grade up  character  which had to be made from a  delta   shift h  and a  sheffer stroke   shift m   this was necessary because the apl character set was much larger than the    characters allowed on the typing element  even when letters were restricted to upper case  capitals  

the first apl interactive login and creation of an apl workspace was in      by larry breed using an ibm      terminal at the ibm mohansic labs near thomas j  watson research center  the home of apl  in yorktown heights  new york 

ibm was chiefly responsible for introducing apl to the marketplace  apl was first available in      for the ibm      as  apl        it would run in as little as  k    bit words of memory  and used a dedicated   megabyte hard disk 

apl gained its foothold on mainframe timesharing systems from the late     s through the early     s  in part because it would support multiple users on lower specification systems that had no dynamic address translation hardware  additional improvements in performance for selected ibm system     mainframe systems included the  apl assist microcode  in which some support for apl execution was included in the processor s firmware  as distinct from being implemented entirely by higher level software  somewhat later  as suitably performing hardware was finally growing available in the mid  to late     s  many users migrated their applications to the personal computer environment 

early ibm apl interpreters for ibm     and ibm     hardware implemented their own multi user management instead of relying on the host services  thus they were their own timesharing systems  first introduced in       the  apl      system was a multi user interpreter  the ability to programmatically communicate with the operating system for information and setting interpreter system variables was done through special privileged  i beam  functions  using both monadic and dyadic operations 

in       ibm released  apl sv   which was a continuation of the same product  but which offered shared variables as a means to access facilities outside of the apl system  such as operating system files  in the mid     s  the ibm mainframe interpreter was even adapted for use on the ibm      desktop computer  which had a small crt and an apl keyboard  when most other small computers of the time only offered basic  in the     s  the  vsapl  program product enjoyed wide use with conversational monitor system  cms   time sharing option  tso   vspc  music sp  and cics users 

in            patrick e  hagerty directed the implementation of the university of maryland apl interpreter for the      line of the sperry univac           series mainframe computers  at the time  sperry had nothing  in       student alan stebbens was assigned the task of implementing an internal function 

in the     s and     s  several timesharing firms arose that sold apl services using modified versions of the ibm apl     interpreter  in north america  the better known ones were i  p  sharp associates  scientific time sharing corporation  stsc   time sharing resources  tsr   and the computer company  tcc   compuserve also entered the market in      with an apl interpreter based on a modified version of digital equipment corp and carnegie mellon s  which ran on dec s ki and kl    bit machines  compuserve s apl was available both to its commercial market and the consumer information service  with the advent first of less expensive mainframes such as the ibm       and later the personal computer  by the mid     s  the timesharing industry was all but gone 

 sharp apl  was available from i  p  sharp associates  first as a timesharing service in the     s  and later as a program product starting around        sharp apl  was an advanced apl implementation with many language extensions  such as  packages   the ability to put one or more objects into a single variable   file system  nested arrays  and shared variables 

apl interpreters were available from other mainframe and mini computer manufacturers also  notably burroughs  control data corporation  cdc   data general  digital equipment corporation  dec   harris  hewlett packard  hp   siemens ag  xerox  and others 

garth foster of syracuse university sponsored regular meetings of the apl implementers  community at syracuse s minnowbrook conference center in blue mountain lake  new york  in later years  eugene mcdonnell organized similar meetings at the asilomar conference grounds near monterey  california  and at pajaro dunes near watsonville  california  the sigapl special interest group of the association for computing machinery continues to support the apl community 

on microcomputers  which became available from the mid     s onwards  basic became the dominant programming language  nevertheless  some microcomputers provided apl instead   the first being the intel      based mcm    which was released in      and which was primarily used in education  another machine of this time was the videobrain family computer  released in       which was supplied with its dialect of apl called apl s 

the commodore superpet  introduced in       included an apl interpreter developed by the university of waterloo 

in       bill gates claimed in his open letter to hobbyists  that microsoft corporation was implementing apl for the intel      and motorola      but had  very little incentive to make  it  available to hobbyists  because of software piracy  it was never released 

starting in the early     s  ibm apl development  under the leadership of jim brown  implemented a new version of the apl language that contained as its primary enhancement the concept of  nested arrays   where an array can contain other arrays  and new language features which facilitated integrating nested arrays into program workflow  ken iverson  no longer in control of the development of the apl language  left ibm and joined i  p  sharp associates  where one of his major contributions was directing the evolution of sharp apl to be more in accord with his vision 

as other vendors were busy developing apl interpreters for new hardware  notably unix based microcomputers  apl  was almost always the standard chosen for new apl interpreter developments  even today  most apl vendors or their users cite apl  compatibility  as a selling point for those products 

 apl   for ibm mainframe computers is still available  ibm cites its use for problem solving  system design  prototyping  engineering and scientific computations  expert systems  for teaching mathematics and other subjects  visualization and database access and was first available for cms and tso in       the apl  workstation edition  windows  os    aix  linux  and solaris  followed much later in the early     s 

various implementations of apl by aplx  dyalog  et al   include extensions for object oriented programming  support for  net framework  xml array conversion primitives  graphing  operating system interfaces  and lambda calculus expressions 

apl has formed the basis of  or influenced  the following languages 


apl has been both criticized and praised for its choice of a unique  non standard character set  some who learn it become ardent adherents  suggesting that there is some weight behind iverson s idea that the notation used does make a difference  in the     s and     s  few terminal devices and even display monitors could reproduce the apl character set  the most popular ones employed the ibm selectric print mechanism used with a special apl type element  one of the early apl line terminals  line mode operation only   not  full screen  was the texas instruments ti model      circa       with the full apl character set which featured half and full duplex telecommunications modes  for interacting with an apl time sharing service or remote mainframe to run a remote computer job  called an rje 

over time  with the universal use of high quality graphic displays  printing devices and unicode support  the apl character font problem has largely been eliminated  however  entering apl characters requires the use of input method editors  keyboard mappings  virtual on screen apl symbol sets  or easy reference printed keyboard cards which can frustrate beginners accustomed to other programming languages  with beginners who have no prior experience with other programming languages  a study involving high school students found that typing and using apl characters did not hinder the students in any measurable way 

in defense of apl use  apl requires less coding to type in  and keyboard mappings become memorized over time  also  special apl keyboards are manufactured and in use today  as are freely available downloadable fonts for operating systems such as microsoft windows  the reported productivity gains assume that one will spend enough time working in apl to make it worthwhile to memorize the symbols  their semantics  and keyboard mappings  not to mention a substantial number of idioms for common tasks 

unlike traditionally structured programming languages  apl code is typically structured as chains of monadic or dyadic functions  and operators acting on arrays  apl has many nonstandard  primitives   functions and operators  that are indicated by a single symbol or a combination of a few symbols  all primitives are defined to have the same precedence  and always associate to the right  thus  apl is  read  or best understood from right to left 

early apl implementations  circa      or so  had no programming loop flow control structures  such as codice   or codice   loops  and codice   constructs  instead  they used array operations  and use of structured programming constructs was often not necessary  since an operation could be performed on a full array in one statement  for example  the codice   function  codice    can replace for loop iteration    n when applied to a scalar positive integer yields a one dimensional array  vector             n  more recent implementations of apl generally include comprehensive control structures  so that data structure and program control flow can be clearly and cleanly separated 

the apl environment is called a  workspace   in a workspace the user can define programs and data  i e   the data values exist also outside the programs  and the user can also manipulate the data without having to define a program  in the examples below  the apl interpreter first types six spaces before awaiting the user s input  its own output starts in column one 
the user can save the workspace with all values  programs  and execution status 

apl uses a set of non ascii symbols  which are an extension of traditional arithmetic and algebraic notation  having single character names for single instruction  multiple data  simd  vector functions is one way that apl enables compact formulation of algorithms for data transformation such as computing conway s game of life in one line of code  in nearly all versions of apl  it is theoretically possible to express any computable function in one expression  that is  in one line of code 

because of the unusual character set  many programmers use special keyboards with apl keytops to write apl code  although there are various ways to write apl code using only ascii characters  in practice it is almost never done   this may be thought to support iverson s thesis about notation as a tool of thought   most if not all modern implementations use standard keyboard layouts  with special mappings or input method editors to access non ascii characters  historically  the apl font has been distinctive  with uppercase italic alphabetic characters and upright numerals and symbols  most vendors continue to display the apl character set in a custom font 

advocates of apl claim that the examples of so called  write only code   badly written and almost incomprehensible code  are almost invariably examples of poor programming practice or novice mistakes  which can occur in any language  advocates also claim that they are far more productive with apl than with more conventional computer languages  and that working software can be implemented in far less time and with far fewer programmers than using other technology 

they also may claim that because it is compact and terse  apl lends itself well to larger scale software development and complexity  because the number of lines of code can be reduced greatly  many apl advocates and practitioners also view standard programming languages such as cobol and java as being comparatively tedious  apl is often found where time to market is important  such as with trading systems 

apl makes a clear distinction between  functions  and  operators   functions take arrays  variables or constants or expressions  as arguments  and return arrays as results  operators  similar to higher order functions  take functions or arrays as arguments  and derive related functions  for example  the  sum  function is derived by applying the  reduction  operator to the  addition  function  applying the same reduction operator to the  maximum  function  which returns the larger of two numbers  derives a function which returns the largest of a group  vector  of numbers  in the j language  iverson substituted the terms  verb  for  function  and  adverb  or  conjunction  for  operator  

apl also identifies those features built into the language  and represented by a symbol  or a fixed combination of symbols  as  primitives   most primitives are either functions or operators  coding apl is largely a process of writing non primitive functions and  in some versions of apl  operators  however a few primitives are considered to be neither functions nor operators  most noticeably assignment 

some words used in apl literature have meanings that differ from those in both mathematics and the generality of computer science 

apl has explicit representations of functions  operators  and syntax  thus providing a basis for the clear and explicit statement of extended facilities in the language  and tools to experiment on them 

this displays  hello  world  
 hello world   sample user session on youtube

a design theme in apl is to define default actions in some cases that would produce syntax errors in most other programming languages 

the  hello  world  string constant above displays  because display is the default action on any expression for which no action is specified explicitly  e g  assignment  function parameter  

another example of this theme is that exponentiation in apl is written as     which indicates raising   to the power    this would be written as    in some other languages and    in fortran and python   however  if no base is specified  as with the statement    in apl  or    in other languages   most other programming languages one would have a syntax error  apl however assumes the missing base to be the natural logarithm constant e               and so interpreting    as    

suppose that is an array of numbers  then gives its average  reading  right to left   gives the number of elements in x  and since is a dyadic operator  the term to its left is required as well  it is in parenthesis since otherwise x would be taken  so that the summation would be of   of each element of x divided by the number of elements in x   and adds all the elements of x  building on this  calculates the standard deviation  further  since assignment is an operator  it can appear within an expression  so 
would place suitable values into t  av and sd  naturally  one would make this expression into a function for repeated use rather than retyping it each time 

this following immediate mode expression generates a typical set of  pick    lottery numbers  six pseudo random integers ranging from   to      guaranteed non repeating   and displays them sorted in ascending order 

the above does a lot  concisely  although it seems complex to a new apler  it combines the following apl  functions   also called  primitives  and  glyphs   

since there is no function to the left of the left most x to tell apl what to do with the result  it simply outputs it to the display  on a single line  separated by spaces  without needing any explicit instruction to do that 

codice   also has a monadic equivalent called codice     which simply returns one random integer between   and its sole operand  to the right of it   inclusive  thus  a role playing game program might use the expression codice    to roll a twenty sided die 

the following expression finds all prime numbers from   to r  in both time and space  the calculation complexity is formula    in big o notation  

executed from right to left  this means 
 note  this assumes the apl origin is    i e   indices start with    apl can be set to use   as the origin  so that codice    is codice     which is convenient for some calculations  

the following expression sorts a word list stored in matrix x according to word length 

the following function  life   written in dyalog apl  takes a boolean matrix and calculates the new generation according to conway s game of life  it demonstrates the power of apl to implement a complex algorithm in very little code  but it is also very hard to follow unless one has advanced knowledge of apl 

in the following example  also dyalog  the first line assigns some html code to a variable codice    and then uses an apl expression to remove all the html tags  explanation  

apl is used for many purposes including financial and insurance applications  artificial intelligence 
neural networks
and robotics  it has been argued that apl is a calculation tool and not a programming language  its symbolic nature and array capabilities have made it popular with domain experts and data scientists who do not have or require the skills of a computer programmer 

apl is well suited to image manipulation and computer animation  where graphic transformations can be encoded as matrix multiplications  one of the first commercial computer graphics houses  digital effects  produced an apl graphics product named  visions   which was used to create television commercials and animation for the      film  tron   latterly  the stormwind boating simulator uses apl to implement its physics engine 

today  apl remains in use in a wide range of commercial and scientific applications  for example
investment management 
asset management 
health care 
and dna profiling  
and by hobbyists 

the first implementation of apl using recognizable apl symbols was apl     which ran on the ibm system      and was completed in november      though at that time remained in use only within ibm  in      its implementors  larry breed  dick lathwell and roger moore  were awarded the grace murray hopper award from the association for computing machinery  acm   it was given  for their work in the design and implementation of apl      setting new standards in simplicity  efficiency  reliability and response time for interactive systems  

in       the ibm      microcomputer offered apl     as one of two built in rom based interpreted languages for the computer  complete with a keyboard and display that supported all the special symbols used in the language 

significant developments to apl     included cms apl  which made use of the virtual storage capabilities of cms and aplsv  which introduced shared variables  system variables and system functions  it was subsequently ported to the ibm system     and vspc platforms until its final release in       after which it was replaced by apl  

in       apl      became the first publicly available apl system  created by ibm for the ibm       it became the most popular ibm type iii library software that ibm released 

apl plus and sharp apl are versions of apl     with added business oriented extensions such as data formatting and facilities to store apl arrays in external files  they were jointly developed by two companies  employing various members of the original ibm apl     development team 
the two companies were i  p  sharp associates  ipsa   an apl     services company formed in      by ian sharp  roger moore and others  and stsc  a time sharing and consulting service company formed in      by lawrence breed and others  together the two developed apl plus and thereafter continued to work together but develop apl separately as apl plus and sharp apl  stsc ported apl plus to many platforms with versions being made for the vax     pc and unix  whereas ipsa took a different approach to the arrival of the personal computer and made sharp apl available on this platform using additional pc xt     hardware  in       soliton incorporated was formed to support sharp apl and it developed sharp apl into sax  sharp apl for unix     apl plus continues as apl     apl win 

in       ian sharp  and dan dyer of stsc  jointly received the kenneth e  iverson award for outstanding contribution to apl 

apl  was a significant re implementation of apl by ibm which was developed from      and first released in       it provides many additions to the language  of which the most notable is nested  non rectangular  array support  it is available for mainframe computers running z os or z vm and workstations running aix  linux  sun solaris  and microsoft windows 

the entire apl  products and services team was awarded the iverson award in      

dyalog apl was first released by british company dyalog ltd  in      and    is available for aix  linux  including on the raspberry pi   macos and microsoft windows platforms  it is based on apl   with extensions to support object oriented programming and functional programming  licences are free for personal non commercial use 

in       two of the development team   john scholes and peter donnelly   were awarded the iverson award for their work on the interpreter  gitte christensen and morten kromberg were joint recipients of the iverson award in      

nars     is an open source apl interpreter written by bob smith  a prominent apl developer and implementor from stsc in the     s and     s  nars     contains advanced features and new datatypes and runs natively on microsoft windows  and other platforms under wine 

aplx is a cross platform dialect of apl  based on apl  and with several extensions  which was first released by british company microapl in       although no longer in development or on commercial sale it is now available free of charge from dyalog 

gnu apl is a free implementation of extended apl as specified in iso iec            and is thus similar to apl   it runs on gnu linux and on windows using cygwin  and uses unicode internally  it was written by j  rgen sauermann 

richard stallman  founder of the gnu project  had been an early adopter of apl  using it to write a text editor as a high school student in the summer of      

apl is traditionally an interpreted language  having language characteristics such as weak variable typing not well suited to compilation  however  with arrays as its core data structure it provides opportunities for performance gains through parallelism  parallel computing  massively parallel applications  and very large scale integration  vlsi   and from the outset apl has been regarded as a high performance language   for example  it was noted for the speed with which it could perform complicated matrix operations  because it operates on arrays and performs operations like matrix inversion internally  

nevertheless  apl is rarely purely interpreted and compilation or partial compilation techniques that are  or have been  used include the following 

most apl interpreters support idiom recognition and evaluate common idioms as single operations  for example  by evaluating the idiom codice    as a single operation  where codice    is a boolean vector and codice    is an array   the creation of two intermediate arrays is avoided 

weak typing in apl means that a name may reference an array  of any datatype   a function or an operator  in general  the interpreter cannot know in advance which form it will be and must therefore perform analysis  syntax checking etc  at run time  however  in certain circumstances  it is possible to deduce in advance what type a name is expected to reference and then generate bytecode which can be executed with reduced run time overhead  this bytecode can also be optimised using compilation techniques such as constant folding or common subexpression elimination  the interpreter will execute the bytecode when present and when any assumptions which have been made are met  dyalog apl includes support for optimised bytecode 

compilation of apl has been the subject of research and experiment since the language first became available  the first compiler is considered to the burroughs apl     which was released around       in order to be able to compile apl  language limitations have to be imposed  apex is a research apl compiler which was written by robert bernecky and is available under the gnu public license 

the stsc apl compiler is a hybrid of a bytecode optimiser and a compiler   it enables compilation of functions to machine code provided that its sub functions and globals are declared  but the interpreter is still used as a runtime library and to execute functions which do not meet the compilation requirements 

apl has been standardized by the american national standards institute  ansi  working group x j   and international organization for standardization  iso  and international electrotechnical commission  iec   iso iec joint technical committee   subcommittee    working group    the core apl language is specified in iso            and the extended apl language is specified in iso iec            









algol

algol    short for  algorithmic language   is a family of imperative computer programming languages  originally developed in the mid     s  which greatly influenced many other languages and was the standard method for algorithm description used by the acm in textbooks and academic sources for more than thirty years 

in the sense that the syntax of most modern languages is  algol like   it was arguably the most influential of the four high level programming languages among which it was roughly contemporary  fortran  lisp  and cobol  it was designed to avoid some of the perceived problems with fortran and eventually gave rise to many other programming languages  including pl i  simula  bcpl  b  pascal  and c 

algol introduced code blocks and the codice     codice   pairs for delimiting them  it was also the first language implementing nested function definitions with lexical scope  moreover  it was the first programming language which gave detailed attention to formal language definition and through the  algol    report  introduced backus   naur form  a principal formal grammar notation for language design 

there were three major specifications  named after the year they were first published 

algol    is substantially different from algol    and was not well received  so that in general  algol  means algol    and dialects thereof 

the international algebraic language  ial   or algol     was extremely influential and generally considered the ancestor of most of the modern programming languages  the so called algol like languages   additionally  algol object code was a simple  compact  and stack based instruction set architecture commonly used in teaching compiler construction and other high order languages  of which algol is generally considered the first  

algol was developed jointly by a committee of european and american computer scientists in a meeting in      at eth zurich  cf  algol      it specified three different syntaxes  a reference syntax  a publication syntax  and an implementation syntax  the different syntaxes permitted it to use different keyword names and conventions for decimal points  commas vs periods  for different languages 

algol was used mostly by research computer scientists in the united states and in europe  its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors other than burroughs corporation  algol    did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development 

john backus developed the backus normal form method of describing programming languages specifically for algol     it was revised and expanded by peter naur for algol     and at donald knuth s suggestion renamed backus   naur form 

peter naur   as editor of the algol bulletin i was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the european language design group in november       in this capacity i was the editor of the algol    report  produced as the result of the algol    meeting in paris in january       

the following people attended the meeting in paris  from   to    january  
alan perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting   the meetings were exhausting  interminable  and exhilarating  one became aggravated when one s good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others  nevertheless  diligence persisted during the entire period  the chemistry of the    was excellent  

algol    inspired many languages that followed it  tony hoare remarked   here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors   the scheme programming language  a variant of lisp that adopted the block structure and lexical scope of algol  also adopted the wording  revised report on the algorithmic language scheme  for its standards documents in homage to algol 

as peter landin noted  the language algol was the first language to combine seamlessly imperative effects with the  call by name  lambda calculus  perhaps the most elegant formulation of the language is due to john c  reynolds  and it best exhibits its syntactic and semantic purity  reynolds s idealized algol also made a convincing methodological argument regarding the suitability of local effects in the context of call by name languages  to be contrasted with the global effects used by call by value languages such as ml  the conceptual integrity of the language made it one of the main objects of semantic research  along with pcf and ml 

to date there have been at least    augmentations  extensions  derivations and sublanguages of algol    

the burroughs dialects included special bootstrapping dialects such as espol and newp  the latter is still used for unisys mcp system software 

algol    as officially defined had no i o facilities  implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other  in contrast  algol    offered an extensive library of  transput   input output  facilities 

algol    allowed for two evaluation strategies for parameter passing  the common call by value  and call by name  call by name has certain effects in contrast to call by reference  for example  without specifying the parameters as  value  or  reference   it is impossible to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable  think of passing a pointer to swap i  a i   in to a function  now that every time swap is referenced  it is reevaluated  say i      and a i        so every time swap is referenced it ll return the other combination of the values                      and so on   a similar situation occurs with a random function passed as actual argument 

call by name is known by many compiler designers for the interesting  thunks  that are used to implement it  donald knuth devised the  man or boy test  to separate compilers that correctly implemented  recursion and non local references   this test contains an example of call by name 

algol    was defined using a two level grammar formalism invented by adriaan van wijngaarden and which bears his name  van wijngaarden grammars use a context free grammar to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular algol    program  notably  they are able to express the kind of requirements that in many other programming language standards are labelled  semantics  and have to be expressed in ambiguity prone natural language prose  and then implemented in compilers as  ad hoc  code attached to the formal language parser 

 procedure absmax a  size  n  m  result  y  subscripts  i  k  

here is an example of how to produce a table using elliott     algol 

punch    sends output to the teleprinter rather than the tape punch 
sameline suppresses the carriage return   line feed normally printed between arguments 
aligned      controls the format of the output with   digit before and   after the decimal point 

the following code samples are algol    versions of the above algol    code samples 

algol    implementations used algol    s approaches to stropping  in algol    s case tokens with the bold typeface are reserved words  types  modes  or operators 

note  lower       and upper       bounds of an array  and array slicing  are directly available to the programmer 

the variations and lack of portability of the programs from one implementation to another is easily demonstrated by the classic hello world program 

algol    had no i o facilities 

since algol    had no i o facilities  there is no portable hello world program in algol 

a simpler program using an inline format 

an even simpler program using the display statement 

an alternative example  using elliott algol i o is as follows  elliott algol used different characters for  open string quote  and  close string quote  

here is a version for the elliott     algol  a     the standard elliott     used   hole paper tape and thus only had upper case  the code lacked any quote characters so     uk pound sign  was used for open quote and    question mark  for close quote  special sequences were placed in double quotes  e g      l   produced a new line on the teleprinter  

the ict      series algol i o version allowed input from paper tape or punched card  paper tape  full  mode allowed lower case  output was to a line printer  the open and close quote characters were represented using     and     and spaces by   

algol    code was published with reserved words typically in lowercase  but bolded or underlined 
in the language of the  algol    report  the input output facilities were collectively called the  transput  

the algols were conceived at a time when character sets were diverse and evolving rapidly  also  the algols were defined so that only  uppercase  letters were required 

      ifip     the algol    language and report included several mathematical symbols which are available on modern computers and operating systems  but  unfortunately  were not supported on most computing systems at the time  for instance                                                     and     

     september  ascii      the ascii character set  then in an early stage of development  had the    back slash  character added to it in order to support algol s boolean operators    and    

      alcor     this character set included the unusual        iron runic cross  character and the        decimal exponent symbol  for floating point notation 

      gost     the      soviet standard gost       allowed the encoding of   bit    bit    bit and   bit characters in algol 

      the  algol    report      used existing algol characters  and further adopted                                                  and    characters which can be found on the ibm      keyboard with  golf ball  print heads inserted  such as the apl golfball   these became available in the mid     s while algol    was being drafted  the report was translated into russian  german  french and bulgarian  and allowed programming in languages with larger character sets  e g  cyrillic alphabet of the soviet besm    all algol s characters are also part of the unicode standard and most of them are available in several popular fonts 

     october  unicode     the        decimal exponent symbol  for floating point notation was added to unicode     for backward compatibility with historic buran  spacecraft  algol software 







awk

awk is a programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool  it is a standard feature of most unix like operating systems 

the awk language is a data driven scripting language consisting of a set of actions to be taken against streams of textual data     either run directly on files or used as part of a pipeline     for purposes of extracting or transforming text  such as producing formatted reports  the language extensively uses the string datatype  associative arrays  that is  arrays indexed by key strings   and regular expressions  while awk has a limited intended application domain and was especially designed to support one liner programs  the language is turing complete  and even the early bell labs users of awk often wrote well structured large awk programs 

awk was created at bell labs in the     s  and its name is derived from the surnames of its authors   alfred aho  peter weinberger  and brian kernighan  the acronym is pronounced the same as the name of the bird auk  which acts as an emblem of the language such as on  the awk programming language  book cover     the book is often referred to by the abbreviation  tapl    when written in all lowercase letters  as codice    it refers to the unix or plan   program that runs scripts written in the awk programming language 

awk was initially developed in      by alfred aho  peter weinberger  and brian kernighan  from whose initials the language takes its name  as one of the early tools to appear in version   unix  awk added computational features to a unix pipeline besides the bourne shell  the only scripting language available in a standard unix environment  it is one of the mandatory utilities of the single unix specification  and is required by the linux standard base specification 

awk was significantly revised and expanded in            resulting in the gnu awk implementation written by paul rubin  jay fenlason  and richard stallman  released in       gnu awk may be the most widely deployed version because it is included with gnu based linux packages  gnu awk has been maintained solely by arnold robbins since       brian kernighan s nawk  new awk  source was first released in      unpublicized  and publicly since the late     s  many bsd systems use it to avoid the gpl license 

awk was preceded by sed         both were designed for text processing  they share the line oriented  data driven paradigm  and are particularly suited to writing one liner programs  due to the implicit main loop and current line variables  the power and terseness of early awk programs     notably the powerful regular expression handling and conciseness due to implicit variables  which facilitate one liners     together with the limitations of awk at the time  were important inspirations for the perl language         in the     s  perl became very popular  competing with awk in the niche of unix text processing languages 

 awk is a language for processing text files  a file is treated as a sequence of records  and by default each line is a record  each line is broken up into a sequence of fields  so we can think of the first word in a line as the first field  the second word as the second field  and so on  an awk program is a sequence of pattern action statements  awk reads the input a line at a time  a line is scanned for each pattern in the program  and for each pattern that matches  the associated action is executed     alfred v  aho
an awk program is a series of pattern action pairs  written as 

where  condition  is typically an expression and  action  is a series of commands  the input is split into records  where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines  the program tests each record against each of the conditions in turn  and executes the  action  for each expression that is true  either the  condition  or the  action  may be omitted  the  condition  defaults to matching every record  the default  action  is to print the record  this is the same pattern action structure as sed 

in addition to a simple awk expression  such as codice   or codice    the  condition  can be codice   or codice   causing the  action  to be executed before or after all records have been read  or  pattern   pattern   which matches the range of records starting with a record that matches  pattern   up to and including the record that matches  pattern   before again trying to match against  pattern   on future lines 

in addition to normal arithmetic and logical operators  awk expressions include the tilde operator  codice    which matches a regular expression against a string  as handy syntactic sugar    regexp   without using the tilde operator matches against the current record  this syntax derives from sed  which in turn inherited it from the ed editor  where codice   is used for searching  this syntax of using slashes as delimiters for regular expressions was subsequently adopted by perl and ecmascript  and is now quite common  the tilde operator was also adopted by perl  but has not seen as wide use 

awk commands are the statements that are substituted for  action  in the examples above  awk commands can include function calls  variable assignments  calculations  or any combination thereof  awk contains built in support for many functions  many more are provided by the various flavors of awk  also  some flavors support the inclusion of dynamically linked libraries  which can also provide more functions 

the  print  command is used to output text  the output text is always terminated with a predefined string called the output record separator  ors  whose default value is a newline  the simplest form of this command is 


although these fields    x   may bear resemblance to variables  the   symbol indicates variables in perl   they actually refer to the fields of the current record  a special case        refers to the entire record  in fact  the commands  codice    and  codice     are identical in functionality 

the  print  command can also display the results of calculations and or function calls 
output may be sent to a file 
or through a pipe 

awk s built in variables include the field variables              and so on     represents the entire record   they hold the text or values in the individual text fields in a record 

other variables include 

variable names can use any of the characters  a za z       with the exception of language keywords  the operators           represent addition  subtraction  multiplication  and division  respectively  for string concatenation  simply place two variables  or string constants  next to each other  it is optional to use a space in between if string constants are involved  but two variable names placed adjacent to each other require a space in between  double quotes delimit string constants  statements need not end with semicolons  finally  comments can be added to programs by using     as the first character on a line 

in a format similar to c  function definitions consist of the keyword codice     the function name  argument names and the function body  here is an example of a function 
this statement can be invoked as follows 
functions can have variables that are in the local scope  the names of these are added to the end of the argument list  though values for these should be omitted when calling the function  it is convention to add some whitespace in the argument list before the local variables  to indicate where the parameters end and the local variables begin 

here is the customary  hello  world  program written in awk 
note that an explicit codice    statement is not needed here  since the only pattern is codice    no command line arguments are processed 

print all lines longer than    characters  note that the default action is to print the current line 

count words in the input and print the number of lines  words  and characters  like wc  
as there is no pattern for the first line of the program  every line of input matches by default  so the increment actions are executed for every line  note that codice    is shorthand for codice    

 s  is incremented by the numeric value of   nf   which is the last word on the line as defined by awk s field separator  by default  white space    nf  is the number of fields in the current line  e g     since      is the value of the fourth field    nf  is the value of the last field in the line regardless of how many fields this line has  or whether it has more or fewer fields than surrounding lines    is actually a unary operator with the highest operator precedence   if the line has no fields  then  nf  is         is the whole line  which in this case is empty apart from possible white space  and so has the numeric value    

at the end of the input the  end  pattern matches  so  s  is printed  however  since there may have been no lines of input at all  in which case no value has ever been assigned to  s   it will by default be an empty string  adding zero to a variable is an awk idiom for coercing it from a string to a numeric value   concatenating an empty string is to coerce from a number to a string  e g   s      note  there s no operator to concatenate strings  they re just placed adjacently   with the coercion the program prints     on an empty input  without it an empty line is printed 

the action statement prints each line numbered  the printf function emulates the standard c printf and works similarly to the print command described above  the pattern to match  however  works as follows   nr  is the number of records  typically lines of input  awk has so far read  i e  the current line number  starting at   for the first line of input      is the modulo operator   nr           is true for the  st   th   th  etc   lines of input  likewise   nr           is true for the  rd   th    th  etc   lines of input  the range pattern is false until the first part matches  on line    and then remains true up to and including when the second part matches  on line    it then stays false until the first part matches again on line   

thus  the program prints lines        skips line    and then        and so on  for each line  it prints the line number  on a   character wide field  and then the line contents  for example  when executed on this input 

the previous program prints 

as a special case  when the first part of a range pattern is constantly true  e g       the range will start at the beginning of the input  similarly  if the second part is constantly false  e g       the range will continue until the end of input  for example 

prints lines of input from the first line matching the regular expression     cut here      that is  a line containing only the phrase    cut here     to the end 

word frequency using associative arrays 
the begin block sets the field separator to any sequence of non alphabetic characters  note that separators can be regular expressions  after that  we get to a bare action  which performs the action on every input line  in this case  for every field on the line  we add one to the number of times that word  first converted to lowercase  appears  finally  in the end block  we print the words with their frequencies  the line
creates a loop that goes through the array  words   setting  i  to each  subscript  of the array  this is different from most languages  where such a loop goes through each  value  in the array  the loop thus prints out each word followed by its frequency count  codice    was an addition to the one true awk  see below  made after the book was published 

this program can be represented in several ways  the first one uses the bourne shell to make a shell script that does everything  it is the shortest of these methods 
the codice    in the awk command is not protected by single quotes so that the shell does expand the variable but it needs to be put in double quotes to properly handle patterns containing spaces  a pattern by itself in the usual way checks to see if the whole line  codice     matches  codice    contains the current filename  awk has no explicit concatenation operator  two adjacent strings concatenate them  codice    expands to the original unchanged input line 

there are alternate ways of writing this  this shell script accesses the environment directly from within awk 
this is a shell script that uses codice     an array introduced in a newer version of the one true awk after the book was published  the subscript of codice    is the name of an environment variable  its result is the variable s value  this is like the getenv function in various standard libraries and posix  the shell script makes an environment variable codice    containing the first argument  then drops that argument and has awk look for the pattern in each file 

codice   checks to see if its left operand matches its right operand  codice    is its inverse  note that a regular expression is just a string and can be stored in variables 

the next way uses command line variable assignment  in which an argument to awk can be seen as an assignment to a variable 
or you can use the   v var value  command line option  e g   awk  v pattern   pattern        

finally  this is written in pure awk  without help from a shell or without the need to know too much about the implementation of the awk script  as the variable assignment on command line one does   but is a bit lengthy 
the codice   is necessary not only to extract the first argument  but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the codice   block ends  codice     the number of arguments  is always guaranteed to be       as codice    is the name of the command that executed the script  most often the string codice     also note that codice    is the empty string  codice     codice    initiates a comment that expands to the end of the line 

note the codice    block  awk only checks to see if it should read from standard input before it runs the command  this means that
only works because the fact that there are no filenames is only checked before codice    is run  if you explicitly set codice    to   so that there are no arguments  awk will simply quit because it feels there are no more input files  therefore  you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename codice    

on unix like operating systems self contained awk scripts can be constructed using the shebang syntax 

for example  a script that prints the content of a given file may be built by creating a file named codice    with the following content 
it can be invoked with  codice   

the codice    tells awk that the argument that follows is the file to read the awk program from  which is the same flag that is used in sed  since they are often used for one liners  both these programs default to executing a program given as a command line argument  rather than a separate file 

awk was originally written in      and distributed with version   unix 

in      its authors started expanding the language  most significantly by adding user defined functions  the language is described in the book  the awk programming language   published       and its implementation was made available in releases of unix system v  to avoid confusion with the incompatible older version  this version was sometimes called  new awk  or  nawk   this implementation was released under a free software license in      and is still maintained by brian kernighan  see external links below  
old versions of unix  such as unix   v  included codice     which converted awk to c  kernighan wrote a program to turn awk into c    its state is not known 









asgard

in norse religion  asgard       enclosure of the   sir   is one of the nine worlds and home to the   sir tribe of gods  it is surrounded by an incomplete wall attributed to a hrimthurs riding the stallion sva  ilfari  according to  gylfaginning   odin and his wife  frigg  are the rulers of asgard 

asgard is home to many named locations  the most well known include valhalla  where half of all those who die in battle are sent  and f  lkvangr  where the other half go 

the primary sources regarding asgard come from the prose edda  written in the   th century by icelandic historian snorri sturluson  and the poetic edda  compiled in the   th century from a basis of much older skaldic poetry 

 v  lusp     the first poem of the work  mentions many of the features and characters of asgard portrayed by snorri  such as yggdrasil and i  av  llr  asgard is composed of    realms including valhalla  thrudheim  breidablik that are ruled by odin  thor and baldr respectively 

the prose edda presents two views regarding asgard 

in the  prologue  snorri offers a euhemerized and christian influenced interpretation of the myths and tales of his forefathers  asgard  he conjectures  is the home of the   sir  singular   s  in as ia  making a folk etymological connection between the three  as    that is  the   sir were  men of asia   not gods  who moved from asia to the north and some of which intermarried with the peoples already there  snorri s interpretation of the   th century foreshadows   th century views of indo european migration from the east 

snorri further writes that asgard is a land more fertile than any other  blessed also with a great abundance of gold and jewels  correspondingly  the   sir excelled beyond all other people in strength  beauty and talent 

snorri proposes the location of asgard as troy  the center of the earth  about it were    kingdoms and    chiefs  one of them  m  n  n  married priam s daughter  tr    n  and had by her a son  tr  r  pronounced thor in old norse  the latter was raised in thrace  at age    he was whiter than ivory  had hair lighter than gold  and could lift    bear skins at once  he explored far and wide  his father  odin  led a migration to the northern lands  where they took wives and had many children  populating the entire north with aesir  one of the sons of odin was yngvi  founder of the ynglingar  an early royal family of sweden  these accounts were written     years after the christianization of iceland 

in  gylfaginning   snorri presents the mythological version  taken no doubt from his sources  icelanders were still being converted at that time  he could not present the myths as part of any current belief  instead he resorts to a debunking device  gylfi  king of sweden before the   sir  travels to asgard and finds there a large hall  valhalla  in section   

within are three officials  three aesir kings   whom gylfi in the guise of gangleri is allowed to question about the asgard and the   sir  a revelation of the ancient myths follows  but at the end the palace and the people disappear in a clap of thunder and gylfi finds himself alone on the plain  having been deluded  section     

in gylfi s delusion  ancient asgard was ruled by the senior god  the all father  who had twelve names  he was the ruler of everything and the creator of heaven and earth  section     during a complex creation myth in which the cosmic cow audhumbla licked b  ri free from the ice  the sons of buri s son  bor  who were odin  vili and v    constructed the universe and put midgard in it as a residence for the first human couple  ask and embla  whom they created from driftwood trees in section   

the sons of bor then constructed asgard  to be identified with troy  snorri insists in section    as a home for the   sir  who were divinities  odin is identified as the all father  asgard is conceived as being on the earth  a rainbow bridge  bifr  st  connects it to heaven  section      in asgard also is a temple for the    gods  gladsheim  and another for the    goddesses  ving  lf  the plain of idavoll is the centre of asgard  section     

the gods hold court there every day at the well of urd  beneath an ash tree  yggdrasil  debating the fates of men and gods  the more immediate destinies of men are assigned by the norns  section      it also states thor is a god as well 

long descriptions of the gods follow  among the more memorable details are the valkyries  the battle maidens whom odin sends to allot death or victory to soldiers  section    names    valkyries and states that the source as the poetic edda poem  gr  mnism  l   odin s residence is valhalla  to which he takes those slain in battle  the einherjar  section      snorri quips   there is a huge crowd there  and there will be many more still       section      they amuse themselves every day by fighting each other and then going to drink in the big hall 

toward the end of the chapter snorri becomes prophetic  describing ragnar  k  the twilight of the gods  it will begin with three winters of snow  with no summers in between  wars will follow  then earthquakes and tidal waves  the sky will split open and out will ride the sons of muspell intent on universal destruction  they will try to enter heaven but bifr  st will break  section      heimdall will blow his mighty horn gj  ll and the   sir and einherjar will ride out to battle  most of the   sir will die and asgard be destroyed  snorri quotes his own source saying   the sun will go black  earth sink in the sea  heaven be stripped of its bright stars       section     

afterwards  the earth rises again from the sea  is fairer than before  and where asgard used to be a remnant of the   sir gather  some coming up from hel  and talk and play chess all day with the golden chessmen of the ancient   sir  which they find in the grass  section     

the   th century skald   orbj  rn d  sarsk  ld is quoted in  sk  ldskaparm  l  as stating 

thor has defended asgard and ygg s  odin s  people  the gods  with strength 

by the time of the  ynglinga saga   snorri had developed his concept of asgard further  although the differences might be accounted for by his sources  in the initial stanzas of the poem asagarth is the capital of asaland  a section of asia to the east of the tana kv  sl or vana kv  sl river  kv  sl is  fork    which snorri explains is the tanais  or don river  flowing into the black sea  the river divides  sweden the great   a concession to the viking point of view  it is never called that prior to the vikings  section    

the river lands are occupied by the vanir and are called vanaland or vanaheim  it is unclear what people snorri thinks the vanes are  whether the proto slavic venedi or the east germanic vandals  who had been in that region at that time for well over      years  he does not say  however  the germanic names of the characters  such as njord  frey and vanlandi  indicate he had the vandals in mind 

odin is the chief of asagarth  from there he conducts and dispatches military expeditions to all parts of the world  he has the virtue of never losing a battle  section     when he is away  his two brothers  vili and v    rule asaland from asagarth 

on the border of sweden is a mountain range running from northeast to southwest  south of it are the lands of the turks  where odin had possessions  thus  the mountains must be the caucasus mountains  on the north are the uninhabitable fells  which must be the tundra taiga country  apparently the vikings did not encounter the urals or the uralics of the region  snorri evidences no knowledge of them 

there also is no mention of troy  which was not far from constantinople  capital of the byzantine empire and militarily beyond the reach of the vikings  troy cannot have been asagarth  snorri realizes  the reason being that the   sir in asaland were unsettled by the military activities of the romans  that is  of the byzantine empire 

as a result  odin led a section of the   sir to the north looking for new lands in which to settle  they used the viking route up the don and the volga through gar  ar  ki  viking russia  from there they went to saxland  germany  and to the lands of gylfi in scandinavia  section     the historical view is mainly fantastical  the germanics were in germany and scandinavia during earliest mention of them in roman literature  long before the romans had conquered even italy  to what extent snorri s presentation is poetic creation only remains unclear 

demoted from his position as all father  or king of the gods  odin becomes a great sorcerer in the ynglinga saga  he can shape shift  speaks only in verse  and lies so well that everything he says seems true  he strikes enemies blind and deaf but when his own men fight they go berserk and cannot be harmed  he has a ship that can be rolled up like a tablecloth when not used  he relies on two talking ravens to gather intelligence  and he consults the talking head of mimir for advice  section    

as a man  however  odin is faced with the necessity to die  he is cremated and his possessions are burned with him so that he can ascend to   where  if asgard is an earthly place  not there  snorri says at first it is valhalla and then adds   the swedes now believed that he had gone to the old asagarth and would live there forever   section     finally snorri resorts to heaven  even though nothing in christianity advocates cremation and certainly the burning of possessions avails the christian nothing 

 asgard  is derived from old norse    ss   god and  gar  r   enclosure  from indo european roots  ansu   spirit  demon  see cognate ahura  also asura  and  gher   grasp  enclose  see cognates garden and yard   essentially meaning  garden of gods  






apollo program

the apollo program  also known as project apollo  was the third united states human spaceflight program carried out by the national aeronautics and space administration  nasa   which accomplished landing the first humans on the moon from      to       first conceived during dwight d  eisenhower s administration as a three man spacecraft to follow the one man project mercury which put the first americans in space  apollo was later dedicated to president john f  kennedy s national goal of  landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth  by the end of the     s  which he proposed in an address to congress on may           it was the third us human spaceflight program to fly  preceded by the two man project gemini conceived in      to extend spaceflight capability in support of apollo 

kennedy s goal was accomplished on the apollo    mission when astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin landed their lunar module  lm  on july           and walked on the lunar surface  while michael collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module  csm   and all three landed safely on earth on july     five subsequent apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon  the last in december       in these six spaceflights  twelve men walked on the moon 

apollo ran from      to       with the first manned flight in       it achieved its goal of manned lunar landing  despite the major setback of a      apollo   cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test  after the first landing  sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration  budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these  five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings  but the apollo    landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the moon  which destroyed the service module s capability to provide electrical power  crippling the csm s propulsion and life support systems  the crew returned to earth safely by using the lunar module as a  lifeboat  for these functions  apollo used saturn family rockets as launch vehicles  which were also used for an apollo applications program  which consisted of skylab  a space station that supported three manned missions in            and the apollo   soyuz test project  a joint us soviet union earth orbit mission in      

apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones  it stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low earth orbit  apollo   was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body  while the final apollo    mission marked the sixth moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low earth orbit  the program returned of lunar rocks and soil to earth  greatly contributing to the understanding of the moon s composition and geological history  the program laid the foundation for nasa s subsequent human spaceflight capability and funded construction of its johnson space center and kennedy space center  apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight  including avionics  telecommunications  and computers 

the apollo program was conceived during the eisenhower administration in early       as a follow up to project mercury  while the mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission  apollo would carry three astronauts  possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station  circumlunar flights  and eventual manned lunar landings 

the program was named after apollo  the greek god of light  music  and the sun  by nasa manager abe silverstein  who later said that  i was naming the spacecraft like i d name my baby   silverstein chose the name at home one evening  early in       because he felt  apollo riding his chariot across the sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program  

in july       nasa deputy administrator hugh l  dryden announced the apollo program to industry representatives at a series of space task group conferences  preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a  mission module  cabin separate from the  command module   piloting and reentry cabin   and a  propulsion and equipment module   on august     a feasibility study competition was announced  and on october     three study contracts were awarded to general dynamics convair  general electric  and the glenn l  martin company  meanwhile  nasa performed its own in house spacecraft design studies led by maxime faget  to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs 

in november       john f  kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised american superiority over the soviet union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense  up to the election of       kennedy had been speaking out against the  missile gap  that he and many other senators felt had formed between the soviets and themselves due to the inaction of president eisenhower  beyond military power  kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige  pledging to make the us not  first but  first and  first if  but first period   despite kennedy s rhetoric  he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the apollo program once he became president  he knew little about the technical details of the space program  and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned moon landing  when kennedy s newly appointed nasa administrator james e  webb requested a    percent budget increase for his agency  kennedy supported an acceleration of nasa s large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue 

on april           soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space  reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union  at a meeting of the us house committee on science and astronautics one day after gagarin s flight  many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that america would catch up  kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news  refusing to make a commitment on america s response to the soviets 
on april     kennedy sent a memo to vice president lyndon b  johnson  asking johnson to look into the status of america s space program  and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up  johnson responded approximately one week later  concluding that  we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership   his memo concluded that a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first 

on may           twenty days after the first us manned spaceflight  freedom     kennedy proposed the manned moon landing in a  special message to the congress on urgent national needs  
now it is time to take longer strides   time for a great new american enterprise   time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement  which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth    i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal  before this decade is out  of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth  no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind  or more important in the long range exploration of space  and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish  

at the time of kennedy s proposal  only one american had flown in space   less than a month earlier   and nasa had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit  even some nasa employees doubted whether kennedy s ambitious goal could be met  by       kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint us ussr moon mission  to eliminate duplication of effort 

with the clear goal of a manned landing replacing the more nebulous goals of space stations and circumlunar flights  nasa decided that  in order to make progress quickly  it would discard the feasibility study designs of convair  ge  and martin  and proceed with faget s command and service module design  the mission module was determined to be only useful as an extra room  and therefore deemed unnecessary  they used faget s design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in october       on november           it was announced that north american aviation had won the contract  although its bid was not rated as good as martin s  webb  dryden and robert seamans chose it in preference due to north american s longer association with nasa and its predecessor 

landing men on the moon by the end of      required the most sudden burst of technological creativity  and the largest commitment of resources      billion    in dollars  ever made by any nation in peacetime  at its peak  the apollo program employed         people and required the support of over        industrial firms and universities 

on july          nasa established the marshall space flight center  msfc  in huntsville  alabama  msfc designed the heavy lift class saturn launch vehicles  which would be required for apollo 

it became clear that managing the apollo program would exceed the capabilities of robert r  gilruth s space task group  which had been directing the nation s manned space program from nasa s langley research center  so gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new nasa center  the manned spacecraft center  msc   a site was chosen in houston  texas  on land donated by rice university  and administrator webb announced the conversion on september           it was also clear nasa would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its cape canaveral air force station launch facilities in florida  so a new mission control center would be included in the msc 
in september       by which time two project mercury astronauts had orbited the earth  gilruth had moved his organization to rented space in houston  and construction of the msc facility was under way  kennedy visited rice to reiterate his challenge in a famous speech 
the msc was completed in september       it was renamed by the us congress in honor of lyndon johnson soon after his death in      

it also became clear that apollo would outgrow the canaveral launch facilities in florida  the two newest launch complexes were already being built for the saturn i and ib rockets at the northernmost end  lc    and lc     but an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission  so land acquisition was started in july      for a launch operations center  loc  immediately north of canaveral at merritt island  the design  development and construction of the center was conducted by kurt h  debus  a member of dr  wernher von braun s original v   rocket engineering team  debus was named the loc s first director  construction began in november       upon kennedy s death  president johnson issued an executive order on november           to rename the loc and cape canaveral in honor of kennedy 

the loc included launch complex     a launch control center  and a     million cubic foot      million cubic meter  vertical assembly building  vab  in which the space vehicle  launch vehicle and spacecraft  would be assembled on a mobile launcher platform and then moved by a transporter to one of several launch pads  although at least three pads were planned  only two  designated a and b  were completed in october       the loc also included an operations and checkout building  ocb  to which gemini and apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles  the apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to   which is nearly a vacuum 

administrator webb realized that in order to keep apollo costs under control  he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization  so he recruited dr  george e  mueller for a high management job  mueller accepted  on the condition that he have a say in nasa reorganization necessary to effectively administer apollo  webb then worked with associate administrator  later deputy administrator  seamans to reorganize the office of manned space flight  omsf   on july           webb announced mueller s appointment as deputy associate administrator for manned space flight  to replace then associate administrator d  brainerd holmes on his retirement effective september    under webb s reorganization  the directors of the manned spacecraft center  gilruth   marshall space flight center  von braun   and the launch operations center  debus  reported to mueller 

based on his industry experience on air force missile projects  mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high ranking officers in the united states air force  so he got webb s permission to recruit general samuel c  phillips  who gained a reputation for his effective management of the minuteman program  as omsf program controller  phillips  superior officer bernard a  schriever agreed to loan phillips to nasa  along with a staff of officers under him  on the condition that phillips be made apollo program director  mueller agreed  and phillips managed apollo from january       until it achieved the first manned landing in july       after which he returned to air force duty 

once kennedy had defined a goal  the apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a spacecraft that could meet it while minimizing risk to human life  cost  and demands on technology and astronaut skill  four possible mission modes were considered 

in early       direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at nasa  many engineers feared that a rendezvous   let alone a docking   neither of which had been attempted even in earth orbit  would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit  dissenters including john houbolt at langley research center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the lor approach  throughout      and       houbolt campaigned for the recognition of lor as a viable and practical option  bypassing the nasa hierarchy  he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to associate administrator robert seamans  while acknowledging that he spoke  somewhat as a voice in the wilderness   houbolt pleaded that lor should not be discounted in studies of the question 
seamans  establishment of an ad hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant nicholas e  golovin in july       to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the apollo program  represented a turning point in nasa s mission mode decision  this committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice  and recommended in favor of a hybrid eor lor mode  its consideration of lor   as well as houbolt s ceaseless work   played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach  in late      and early       members of the manned spacecraft center began to come around to support lor  including the newly hired deputy director of the office of manned space flight  joseph shea  who became a champion of lor  the engineers at marshall space flight center  msfc   which had much to lose from the decision  took longer to become convinced of its merits  but their conversion was announced by wernher von braun at a briefing on june         

but even after nasa reached internal agreement  it was far from smooth sailing  kennedy s science advisor jerome wiesner  who had expressed his opposition to manned spaceflight to kennedy before the president took office  and had opposed the decision to land men on the moon  hired golovin  who had left nasa  to chair his own  space vehicle panel   ostensibly to monitor  but actually to second guess nasa s decisions on the saturn v launch vehicle and lor by forcing shea  seamans  and even webb to defend themselves  delaying its formal announcement to the press on july           and forcing webb to still hedge the decision as  tentative  

wiesner kept up the pressure  even making the disagreement public during a two day september visit by the president to marshall space flight center  wiesner blurted out  no  that s no good  in front of the press  during a presentation by von braun  webb jumped in and defended von braun  until kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was  still subject to final review   webb held firm  and issued a request for proposal to candidate lunar excursion module  lem  contractors  wiesner finally relented  unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in kennedy s office  because of the president s involvement with the october cuban missile crisis  and fear of kennedy s support for webb  nasa announced the selection of grumman as the lem contractor in november      

space historian james hansen concludes that 

the lor method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a  lifeboat  in the event of a failure of the command ship  some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen  a      msc study concluded   the lm  as lifeboat      was finally dropped  because no single reasonable csm failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the sps   ironically  just such a failure happened on apollo    when an oxygen tank explosion left the csm without electrical power  the lunar module provided propulsion  electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely 

faget s preliminary apollo design employed a cone shaped command module  supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power  sized appropriately for the space station  cislunar  and lunar landing missions  once kennedy s moon landing goal became official  detailed design began of a  command and service module   csm  in which the crew would spend the entire direct ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip  after being soft landed by a larger landing propulsion module  the final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the csm s role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew  along with a new spacecraft  the  lunar excursion module   lem  later shortened to  lunar module   lm  which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the csm 

the command module  cm  was the conical crew cabin  designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an earth ocean landing  it was the only component of the apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early apollo study designs  its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield  and had its own reaction control system  rcs  engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path  parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown  the module was tall  in diameter  and weighed approximately  

a cylindrical service module  sm  supported the command module  with a service propulsion engine and an rcs with propellants  and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants  a high gain s band antenna was used for long distance communications on the lunar flights  on the extended lunar missions  an orbital scientific instrument package was carried  the service module was discarded just before reentry  the module was long and in diameter  the initial lunar flight version weighed approximately fully fueled  while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over  

north american aviation won the contract to build the csm  and also the second stage of the saturn v launch vehicle for nasa  because the csm design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous  the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the csm off the moon  and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight  also  there was no provision for docking with the lunar module  a      program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as block i which would be used for early testing  while block ii  the actual lunar spacecraft  would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in block i development 

the lunar module  lm  was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module  not designed to fly through the earth s atmosphere or return to earth  its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations  and was of an extremely lightweight construction  it consisted of separate descent and ascent stages  each with its own engine  the descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant  surface stay consumables  and surface exploration equipment  the ascent stage contained the crew cabin  ascent propellant  and a reaction control system  the initial lm model weighed approximately   and allowed surface stays up to around    hours  an extended lunar module weighed over   and allowed surface stays of over   days  the contract for design and construction of the lunar module was awarded to grumman aircraft engineering corporation  and the project was overseen by thomas j  kelly 

before the apollo program began  wernher von braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles  the saturn series  and the even larger nova series  in the midst of these plans  von braun was transferred from the army to nasa  and made director of the marshall space flight center  the initial direct ascent plan to send the three man apollo command and service module directly to the lunar surface  on top of a large descent rocket stage  would require a nova class launcher  with a lunar payload capability of over   the june           decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the saturn v to replace the nova  and the msfc proceeded to develop the saturn rocket family for apollo 

since apollo  like mercury  would require a launch escape system  les  in case of a launch failure  a relatively small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system  a size bigger than the naa little joe would be required  so the little joe ii was built by general dynamics convair  after an august      qualification test flight  four les test flights  a     through      were made at the white sands missile range between may      and january      

since apollo  like mercury  used more than one launch vehicle for space missions  nasa used spacecraft launch vehicle combination series numbers  as   x for saturn i  as   x for saturn ib  and as   x for saturn v  compare mercury redstone    mercury atlas    to designate and plan all missions  rather than numbering them sequentially as in project gemini  this was changed by the time manned flights began 

saturn i  the first us heavy lift launch vehicle  was initially planned to launch partially equipped csms in low earth orbit tests  the s i first stage burned rp   with liquid oxygen  lox  oxidizer in eight clustered rocketdyne h   engines  to produce of thrust  the s iv second stage used six liquid hydrogen fueled pratt   whitney rl    engines with of thrust  a planned centaur  s v  third stage with two rl    engines never flew on saturn i 

the first four saturn i test flights were launched from lc     with only live first stages  carrying dummy upper stages filled with water  the first flight with a live s iv was launched from lc     this was followed by five launches of boilerplate csms  designated as     through as      into orbit in      and       the last three of these further supported the apollo program by also carrying pegasus satellites  which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts 

in september       nasa planned to launch four manned csm flights on the saturn i from late      through       concurrent with project gemini  the payload capacity would have severely limited the systems which could be included  so the decision was made in october      to use the uprated saturn ib for all manned earth orbital flights 

the saturn ib was an upgraded version of the saturn i  the s ib first stage increased the thrust to by uprating the h   engine  the second stage replaced the s iv with the s ivb      powered by a single j   engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with lox  to produce of thrust  a restartable version of the s ivb was used as the third stage of the saturn v  the saturn ib could send over into low earth orbit  sufficient for a partially fueled csm or the lm  saturn ib launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as     series number   as  indicating  apollo saturn  and the     indicating the second member of the saturn rocket family 

saturn v launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as     series number   as  indicating  apollo saturn  and the     indicating saturn v  the three stage saturn v was designed to send a fully fueled csm and lm to the moon  it was in diameter and stood tall with its lunar payload  its capability grew to for the later advanced lunar landings  the s ic first stage burned rp   lox for a rated thrust of   which was upgraded to   the second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen  and the third stage was a modified version of the s ivb  with thrust increased to and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a parking orbit 

nasa s director of flight crew operations during the apollo program was donald k   deke  slayton  one of the original mercury seven astronauts who was medically grounded in september      due to a heart murmur  slayton was responsible for making all gemini and apollo crew assignments 
thirty two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the apollo program  twenty four of these left earth s orbit and flew around the moon between december      and december       three of them twice   half of the    walked on the moon s surface  though none of them returned to it after landing once  one of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist  of the     gus grissom  ed white  and roger chaffee were killed during a ground test in preparation for the apollo   mission 

the apollo astronauts were chosen from the project mercury and gemini veterans  plus from two later astronaut groups  all missions were commanded by gemini or mercury veterans  crews on all development flights  except the earth orbit csm development flights  through the first two landings on apollo    and apollo     included at least two  sometimes three  gemini veterans  dr  harrison schmitt  a geologist  was the first nasa scientist astronaut to fly in space  and landed on the moon on the last mission  apollo     schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the apollo landing crews 

nasa awarded all    of these astronauts its highest honor  the distinguished service medal  given for  distinguished service  ability  or courage   and personal  contribution representing substantial progress to the nasa mission   the medals were awarded posthumously to grissom  white  and chaffee in       then to the crews of all missions from apollo   onward  the crew that flew the first earth orbital test mission apollo    walter m  schirra  donn eisele  and walter cunningham  were awarded the lesser nasa exceptional service medal  because of discipline problems with the flight director s orders during their flight  the nasa administrator in october        decided to award them the distinguished service medals  by this time posthumously to schirra and eisele 

the nominal planned lunar landing mission proceeded as follows 


two block i csms were launched from lc    on suborbital flights in      with the saturn ib  the first  as     launched on february     reached an altitude of and splashed down downrange in the atlantic ocean  the second  as     on august     reached altitude and was recovered downrange in the pacific ocean  these flights validated the service module engine and the command module heat shield 

a third saturn ib test  as     launched from pad     went into orbit to support design of the s ivb upper stage restart capability needed for the saturn v  it carried a nosecone instead of the apollo spacecraft  and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel  the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors  and a tv camera  this flight occurred on july    before as      which was delayed because of problems getting the apollo spacecraft ready for flight 

two manned orbital block i csm missions were planned  as     and as      the block i crew positions were titled command pilot  senior pilot  and pilot  the senior pilot would assume navigation duties  while the pilot would function as a systems engineer  the astronauts would wear a modified version of the gemini spacesuit 

after an unmanned lm test flight as      a crew would fly the first block ii csm and lm in a dual mission known as as          or as      each spacecraft would be launched on a separate saturn ib   the block ii crew positions were titled commander  command module pilot  and lunar module pilot  the astronauts would begin wearing a new apollo a l spacesuit  designed to accommodate lunar extravehicular activity  eva   the traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear  fishbowl  type for greater visibility  and the lunar surface eva suit would include a water cooled undergarment 

deke slayton  the grounded mercury astronaut who became director of flight crew operations for the gemini and apollo programs  selected the first apollo crew in january       with grissom as command pilot  white as senior pilot  and rookie donn f  eisele as pilot  but eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the kc    weightlessness training aircraft  and had to undergo surgery on january     slayton replaced him with chaffee  nasa announced the final crew selection for as     on march           with the backup crew consisting of gemini veterans james mcdivitt and david scott  with rookie russell l   rusty  schweickart  mercury gemini veteran wally schirra  eisele  and rookie walter cunningham were announced on september    as the prime crew for as     

in december       the as     mission was canceled  since the validation of the csm would be accomplished on the    day first flight  and as     would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft  its saturn ib was allocated to the dual mission  now redesignated as         or as      planned for august       mcdivitt  scott and schweickart were promoted to the prime as     crew  and schirra  eisele and cunningham were reassigned as the apollo   backup crew 

the spacecraft for the as     and as     missions were delivered by north american aviation to the kennedy space center with long lists of equipment problems which had to be corrected before flight  these delays caused the launch of as     to slip behind as      and eliminated hopes the first manned mission might be ready to launch as soon as november       concurrently with the last gemini mission  eventually the planned as     flight date was pushed to february          

north american aviation was prime contractor not only for the apollo csm  but for the saturn v s ii second stage as well  and delays in this stage pushed the first unmanned saturn v flight as     from late      to november        the initial assembly of as     had to use a dummy spacer spool in place of the stage  

the problems with north american were severe enough in late      to cause manned space flight administrator george mueller to appoint program director samuel phillips to head a  tiger team  to investigate north american s problems and identify corrections  phillips documented his findings in a december    letter to naa president lee atwood  with a strongly worded letter by mueller  and also gave a presentation of the results to mueller and deputy administrator robert seamans  meanwhile  grumman was also encountering problems with the lunar module  eliminating hopes it would be ready for manned flight in       not long after the first manned csm flights 

grissom  white  and chaffee decided to name their flight apollo   as a motivational focus on the first manned flight  they trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at north american  and in the altitude chamber at the kennedy space center  a  plugs out  test was planned for january  which would simulate a launch countdown on lc    with the spacecraft transferring from pad supplied to internal power  if successful  this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the february    launch  with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled 

the plugs out test began on the morning of january           and immediately was plagued with problems  first the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits  which delayed the sealing of the hatch  then  communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown  during this hold  an electrical fire began in the cabin  and spread quickly in the high pressure       oxygen atmosphere  pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst  allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew  the astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened 

nasa immediately convened an accident review board  overseen by both houses of congress  while the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex  the review board concluded that  deficiencies existed in command module design  workmanship and quality control   at the insistence of nasa administrator webb  north american removed harrison storms as command module program manager  webb also reassigned apollo spacecraft program office  aspo  manager joseph francis shea  replacing him with george low 
to remedy the causes of the fire  changes were made in the block ii spacecraft and operational procedures  the most important of which were use of a nitrogen oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch  and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials  the block ii design already called for replacement of the block i plug type hatch cover with a quick release  outward opening door  nasa discontinued the manned block i program  using the block i spacecraft only for unmanned saturn v flights  crew members would also exclusively wear modified  fire resistant a l block ii space suits  and would be designated by the block ii titles  regardless of whether a lm was present on the flight or not 

on april           mueller published an official apollo mission numbering scheme  using sequential numbers for all flights  manned or unmanned  the sequence would start with apollo   to cover the first three unmanned flights while retiring the apollo   designation to honor the crew  per their widows  wishes 

in september       mueller approved a sequence of mission types which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the manned lunar landing  each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed  and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary  therefore letters were used instead of numbers  the a missions were unmanned saturn v validation  b was unmanned lm validation using the saturn ib  c was manned csm earth orbit validation using the saturn ib  d was the first manned csm lm flight  this replaced as      using a single saturn v launch   e would be a higher earth orbit csm lm flight  f would be the first lunar mission  testing the lm in lunar orbit but without landing  a  dress rehearsal    and g would be the first manned landing  the list of types covered follow on lunar exploration to include h lunar landings  i for lunar orbital survey missions  and j for extended stay lunar landings 

the delay in the csm caused by the fire enabled nasa to catch up on man rating the lm and saturn v  apollo    as      was the first unmanned flight of the saturn v  carrying a block i csm on november          the capability of the command module s heat shield to survive a trans lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual earth orbital reentry speed 

apollo    as      was the first unmanned test flight of lm in earth orbit  launched from pad    on january           by the saturn ib that would have been used for apollo    the lm engines were successfully test fired and restarted  despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing  the ascent engine was fired in abort mode  known as a  fire in the hole  test  where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage  although grumman wanted a second unmanned test  george low decided the next lm flight would be manned 

this was followed on april          by apollo    as      which carried a csm and a lm test article as ballast  the intent of this mission was to achieve trans lunar injection  followed closely by a simulated direct return abort  using the service module engine to achieve another high speed reentry  the saturn v experienced pogo oscillation  a problem caused by non steady engine combustion  which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages  two s ii engines shut down prematurely  but the remaining engines were able to compensate  the damage to the third stage engine was more severe  preventing it from restarting for trans lunar injection  mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of apollo    based on the good performance of apollo   and identification of satisfactory fixes to the apollo   problems  nasa declared the saturn v ready to fly men  cancelling a third unmanned test 

apollo    launched from lc    on october           was the c mission  crewed by schirra  eisele and cunningham  it was an    day earth orbital flight which tested the csm systems 

apollo   was planned to be the d mission in december       crewed by mcdivitt  scott and schweickart  launched on a saturn v instead of two saturn ibs  in the summer it had become clear that the lm would not be ready in time  rather than waste the saturn v on another simple earth orbiting mission  aspo manager george low suggested the bold step of sending apollo   to orbit the moon instead  deferring the d mission to the next mission in march       and eliminating the e mission  this would keep the program on track  the soviet union had sent two tortoises  mealworms  wine flies  and other lifeforms around the moon on september           aboard zond    and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts  the decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of apollo    gemini veterans frank borman and jim lovell  and rookie william anders captured the world s attention by making ten lunar orbits in    hours  transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on christmas eve  and returning safely to earth 

the following march  lm flight  rendezvous and docking were successfully demonstrated in earth orbit on apollo    and schweickart tested the full lunar eva suit with its portable life support system  plss  outside the lm  the f mission was successfully carried out on apollo    in may      by gemini veterans thomas p  stafford  john young and eugene cernan  stafford and cernan took the lm to within of the lunar surface 

the g mission was achieved on apollo    in july      by an all gemini veteran crew consisting of neil armstrong  michael collins and buzz aldrin  armstrong and aldrin performed the first landing at the sea of tranquility at          utc on july           they spent a total of    hours     minutes on the surface  and spent   hours     minutes outside the spacecraft  walking on the surface  taking photographs  collecting material samples  and deploying automated scientific instruments  while continuously sending black and white television back to earth  the astronauts returned safely on july    

in november       gemini veteran charles  pete  conrad and rookie alan l  bean made a precision landing on apollo    within walking distance of the surveyor   unmanned lunar probe  which had landed in april      on the ocean of storms  the command module pilot was gemini veteran richard f  gordon jr  conrad and bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera  but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the sun  they made two evas totaling   hours and    minutes  on one  they walked to the surveyor  photographed it  and removed some parts which they returned to earth 

the success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander  with two rookies  apollo    launched lovell  jack swigert  and fred haise in april       headed for the fra mauro formation  but two days out  a liquid oxygen tank exploded  disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the lm as a  life boat  to return to earth  another nasa review board was convened to determine the cause  which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory  and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications  apollo was grounded again  for the remainder of      while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added 

the contracted batch of    saturn vs were enough for lunar landing missions through apollo     nasa publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites  with plans to increase the mass of the csm and lm for the last five missions  along with the payload capacity of the saturn v  these final missions would combine the i and j types in the      list  allowing the cmp to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface  and allowing them to stay on the moon for over three days  these missions would also carry the lunar roving vehicle  lrv  increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the lm  also  the block ii spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the lrv 

about the time of the first landing in       it was decided to use an existing saturn v to launch the skylab orbital laboratory pre built on the ground  replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several saturn ib launches  this eliminated apollo     nasa s yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing  and nasa also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming space shuttle  by       the decision was made to also cancel missions    and     the two unused saturn vs became museum exhibits at the john f  kennedy space center on merritt island  florida  george c  marshall space center in huntsville  alabama  michoud assembly facility in new orleans  louisiana  and lyndon b  johnson space center in houston  texas 

the cutbacks forced mission planners to reassess the original planned landing sites in order to achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions  apollo    had been planned to be the last of the h series missions  but since there would be only two subsequent missions left  it was changed to the first of three j missions 

apollo    s fra mauro mission was reassigned to apollo     commanded in february      by mercury veteran alan shepard  with stuart roosa and edgar mitchell  this time the mission was successful  shepard and mitchell spent    hours and    minutes on the surface  and completed two evas totalling   hours    minutes  which was a record for the longest eva by a lunar crew at the time 

in august       just after conclusion of the apollo    mission  president richard nixon proposed canceling the two remaining lunar landing missions  apollo    and     office of management and budget deputy director caspar weinberger was opposed to this  and persuaded nixon to keep the remaining missions 

apollo    was launched on july           with david scott  alfred worden and james irwin  scott and irwin landed on july    near hadley rille  and spent just under two days     hours on the surface  in over    hours of eva  they collected about of lunar material 

apollo    landed in the descartes highlands on april           the crew was commanded by john young  with ken mattingly and charles duke  young and duke spent just under three days on the surface  with a total of over    hours eva 

apollo    was the last of the apollo program  landing in the taurus   littrow region in december       eugene cernan commanded ronald e  evans and nasa s first scientist astronaut  geologist dr  harrison h  schmitt  schmitt was originally scheduled for apollo     but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing  cernan and schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over    hours of total eva

the rocks collected from the moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on earth  as measured by radiometric dating techniques  they range in age from about     billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria  to about     billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust  as such  they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the solar system  that are largely absent on earth  one important rock found during the apollo program is dubbed the genesis rock  retrieved by astronauts david scott and james irwin during the apollo    mission  this anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium rich feldspar mineral anorthite  and is believed to be representative of the highland crust  a geochemical component called kreep was discovered by apollo     which has no known terrestrial counterpart  kreep and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the moon was once completely molten  see lunar magma ocean  

almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects  many samples appear to be pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters  which is never seen on earth rocks  due to the thick atmosphere  many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events  some of the returned samples are of  impact melt   materials melted near an impact crater   all samples returned from the moon are highly brecciated as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events 

analysis of composition of the lunar samples supports the giant impact hypothesis  that the moon was created through impact of a large astronomical body with the earth 

when president kennedy first chartered the moon landing program  a preliminary cost estimate of    billion was generated  but this proved an extremely unrealistic guess of what could not possibly be determined precisely  and james webb used his judgment as administrator to change the estimate to     billion before giving it to vice president johnson 

when kennedy made his      speech at rice university  the annual space budget was      billion  and he described this cost as    cents per person per week   somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year   but that the moon program would soon raise this to  more than    cents a week for every man  woman and child in the united states  

webb s estimate shocked many at the time  including the president  but ultimately proved accurate  in january       nasa prepared an itemized estimate of the run out cost of the apollo program  the total came to       billion  itemized as follows 

the final cost of apollo was reported to congress as       billion in       it took up the majority of nasa s budget while it was being developed  for example  in      it accounted for about    percent of nasa s total      billion budget  that was one of the biggest investment of the us in science  research and development  and employed thousands of american scientists  a single saturn v launch in      cost up to      million  compared to the national science foundation s fiscal year      budget of      million 

in       nasa held a symposium on project costs which presented an estimate of the apollo program costs in      dollars as roughly      billion    in dollars   this included all research and development costs  the procurement of    saturn v rockets     command and service modules     lunar modules  plus program support and management costs  construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading  and costs for flight operations  this was based on a congressional budget office report   a budgetary analysis of nasa s new vision for space   september        the space review  estimated in      the cost of apollo from      to      as       billion  or      billion in      dollars     in dollars 

looking beyond the manned lunar landings  nasa investigated several post lunar applications for apollo hardware  the apollo extension series   apollo x    proposed up to    flights to earth orbit  using the space in the spacecraft lunar module adapter  sla  to house a small orbital laboratory  workshop   astronauts would continue to use the csm as a ferry to the station  this study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty s ivb saturn upper stage  and grew into the apollo applications program  aap   the workshop was to be supplemented by the apollo telescope mount  which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack  the most ambitious plan called for using an empty s ivb as an interplanetary spacecraft for a venus fly by mission 

the s ivb orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board  dubbed skylab  it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space  and launched in      using the two lower stages of a saturn v  it was equipped with an apollo telescope mount  skylab s last crew departed the station on february          and the station itself reentered the atmosphere in      

the apollo soyuz test project also used apollo hardware for the first joint nation space flight  paving the way for future cooperation with other nations in the space shuttle and international space station programs 

in september       the x prize foundation and google announced the google lunar x prize  to be awarded for a robotic lunar landing mission which transmits close up images of the apollo lunar modules and other artificial objects on the surface 

in       japan aerospace exploration agency s selene probe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the apollo    lunar module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface  in       nasa s robotic lunar reconnaissance orbiter  while orbiting above the moon  began photographing the remnants of the apollo program left on the lunar surface  and photographed each site where manned apollo flights landed  all of the u  s  flags left on the moon during the apollo missions were found to still be standing  with the exception of the one left during the apollo    mission  which was blown over during that mission s lift off from the lunar surface and return to the mission command module in lunar orbit  the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown 

in a november           editorial   the new york times  opined 

the apollo program has been called the greatest technological achievement in human history  apollo stimulated many areas of technology  leading to over       spinoff products as of       the flight computer design used in both the lunar and command modules was  along with the polaris and minuteman missile systems  the driving force behind early research into integrated circuits  ic   by       apollo was using    percent of the united states  production of ics  the crucial difference between the requirements of apollo and the missile programs was apollo s much greater need for reliability  while the navy and air force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles  the political and financial cost of failure of an apollo mission was unacceptably high 

the crew of apollo   sent the first live televised pictures of the earth and the moon back to earth  and read from the creation story in the book of genesis  on christmas eve       an estimated one quarter of the population of the world saw   either live or delayed   the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon  and an estimated one fifth of the population of the world watched the live transmission of the apollo    moonwalk 

the apollo program also affected environmental activism in the     s due to photos taken by the astronauts  the most famous  taken by the apollo    astronauts  is  the blue marble   this image  which was released during a surge in environmentalism  became a symbol of the environmental movement  as a depiction of earth s frailty  vulnerability  and isolation amid the vast expanse of space 

according to  the economist   apollo succeeded in accomplishing president kennedy s goal of taking on the soviet union in the space race  and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement  to demonstrate the superiority of the free market system  the publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal  the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast  centralized government bureaucracy 

as part of apollo    s   th anniversary in       nasa spearheaded an effort to digitally restore the existing videotapes of the mission s live televised moonwalk  after an exhaustive three year search for missing tapes of the original video of the apollo    moonwalk  nasa concluded the data tapes had more than likely been accidentally erased 

the lunar eva video was produced with a special apollo tv camera which scanned the picture in a format incompatible with broadcast tv  this required conversion for live television broadcast  which due to the state of      technology caused some degradation of picture quality  but the unconverted picture signal was recorded on magnetic telemetry tapes  in       stanley lebar  who had led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at westinghouse electric corporation  worked with nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes  with the goal of seeing if more modern technology could produce a broadcast ready picture closer to the original quality  however  in the intervening years  a magnetic tape shortage prompted nasa to recall massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the national archives and records administration to be reused to record newer satellite data 

with a budget of           the surviving original lunar broadcast data from apollo    was compiled by nafzger and assigned to lowry digital for restoration  the video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy  the images were from tapes in australia  the cbs news archive  and kinescope recordings made at johnson space center  the restored video  remaining in black and white  contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements 

numerous documentary films cover the apollo program and the space race  including

assault

an assault is the act of inflicting physical harm or unwanted physical contact upon a person or  in some specific legal definitions  a threat or attempt to commit such an action  it is both a crime and a tort and  therefore  may result in either criminal and or civil liability  generally  the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law  

traditionally  common law legal systems had separate definitions for assault and battery  when this distinction is observed  battery refers to the actual bodily contact  whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery  some jurisdictions combined the two offences into assault and battery  which then became widely referred to as  assault   the result is that in many of these jurisdictions  assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery  the legal systems of civil law and scots law have never distinguished assault from battery 

legal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity  in the united states  an assault can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony  in england and wales and australia  it can be charged as either common assault  assault occasioning actual bodily harm  abh  or grievous bodily harm  gbh   canada also has a three tier system  assault  assault causing bodily harm and aggravated assault  separate charges typically exist for sexual assaults  affray and assaulting a police officer  assault may overlap with an attempted crime  for example an assault may be charged as an attempted murder if it was done with intent to kill

in jurisdictions that make a distinction between the two  assault usually accompanies battery if the assailant both threatens to make unwanted contact and then carries through with this threat  see common assault  the elements of battery are     a volitional act     done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and     which causes such contact  thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting them is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person  and is an assault if the rock misses 

aggravated assault is  in some jurisdictions  a stronger form of assault  usually using a deadly weapon  a person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to 

aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants 

although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions  the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault 

exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as de minimis harm  assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on  or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others 

consent may be a complete or partial defense to assault  in some jurisdictions  most notably england  it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe  as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault  this can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual sadomasochistic sexual activity  the most notable case being the operation spanner case  legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery  activities within the rules of a game  mixed martial arts  wrestling  boxing  or contact sports   bodily adornment   r v wilson         crim lr       or horseplay   r v jones         crim lr       however  any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent  in scottish law  consent is not a defense for assault 

police officers and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an arrest or generally carrying out their official duties  thus  a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary 

in some jurisdictions such as singapore  judicial corporal punishment is part of the legal system  the officers who administer the punishment have immunity from prosecution for assault 

in the united states  the united kingdom  australia and canada  corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable  what constitutes  reasonable  varies in both statutory law and case law  unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for child abuse 

many countries  including some us states  also permit the use of corporal punishment for children in school  in english law  s      children act      limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s      criminal justice act      

this may or may not involve self defense in that  using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault  but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence 

some jurisdictions allow force to be used in defense of property  to prevent damage either in its own right  or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime  in english law  under s  criminal damage act      it may be argued that the defendant has a  lawful excuse  to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s  criminal law act       subject to the need to deter vigilantes and excessive self help  furthermore  some jurisdictions  such as ohio  allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder  the resident merely needs to assert to the court that they felt threatened by the intruder s presence 

this defense is not universal  in new zealand  for example  homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars 

assault is an offence under s      of the canadian criminal code  there is a wide range of the types of assault that can occur  generally  an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent  it can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force  or threatens to do so  without the consent of the other person  an injury need not occur for an assault to be committed  but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force  it can be an assault to  tap    pinch    push   or direct another such minor action toward another  but an accidental application of force is not an assault 

the potential punishment for an assault in canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed  the criminal code defines assault as a dual offence  indictable or summary offence   police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the public s interest to do so notwithstanding s        d  of the code  this public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim 

some variations on the ordinary crime of assault include 


an individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon  assault causing bodily harm  aggravated assault  or any sexual assault  consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused  r v paice  r v jobidon   a person cannot consent to serious bodily harm 

the indian penal code covers the punishments and types of assault in chapter     sections     through     
the code further explains that  mere words do not amount to an assault  but the words which a person uses may give to their gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault   assault is in indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force  with criminal force being described in s       the attempt itself has been made an offence in india  as in other states 

the criminal code act  chapter    of part v  sections     to      creates a number of offences of assault  assault is defined by section     of that act  assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment  assault with  intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her  or who indecently assaults another  or who commits other more serious variants of assault  as defined in the act  are guilty of a felony  and longer prison terms are provided for 

marshall islands

the offence of assault is created by section     of the criminal code  a person is guilty of this offence if they unlawfully offer or attempt  with force or violence  to strike  beat  wound  or do bodily harm to  another 

section   of the non fatal offences against the person act      creates the offence of assault  and section   of that act creates the offence of assault causing harm 

south african law does not draw the distinction between assault and battery   assault  is a common law crime defined as  unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another  or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him   the law also recognises the crime of  assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm   where grievous bodily harm is defined as  harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health   the common law crime of  indecent assault  was repealed by the criminal law  sexual offences and related matters  amendment act        and replaced by a statutory crime of  sexual assault  


abolished offences 


english law provides for two offences of assault  common assault and battery  assault  or common assault  is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence   violence  in this context means any unlawful touching  though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile  confusingly  the terms  assault  and  common assault  often encompass the separate offence of battery  even in statutory settings such as s       a  of the criminal justice act      

a common assault is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty  section    of the criminal justice act      provides that common assault  like battery  is triable only in the magistrates  court in england and wales  unless it is linked to a more serious offence  which is triable in the crown court   additionally  if a defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm  abh   or racially religiously aggravated assault  then a jury in the crown court may acquit the defendant of the more serious offence  but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed 

an assault which is aggravated by the scale of the injuries inflicted may be charged as offences causing  actual bodily harm   abh  or  in the severest cases   grievous bodily harm   gbh  

other aggravated assault charges refer to assaults carried out against a specific target or with a specific intent 

in scots law  assault is defined as an  attack upon the person of another   there is no distinction made in scotland between assault and battery  which is not a term used in scots law   although  as in england and wales  assault can be occasioned without a  physical  attack on another s person  as demonstrated in  atkinson v  hm advocate  wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a ski mask  the court said 

scottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury  the use of a weapon  or  hamesuken   to assault a person in their own home   the  mens rea  for assault is simply  evil intent   although this has been held to mean no more than that assault  cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently  as upheld in  lord advocate s reference no   of       where it was found that a  hold up  in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence 

it is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of their duty  under section     police and fire reform  scotland  act       previously section    of the police  scotland  act       which provides that it is an offence for a person to  amongst other things  assault a constable in the execution of their duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of their duty 

several offences of assault exist in northern ireland  the offences against the person act      creates the offences of 
the criminal justice  miscellaneous provisions  act  northern ireland       creates the offences of 

that act formerly created the offence of  assault on a constable in the execution of his duty   under section      a   but that section has been superseded by section       of the police  northern ireland  act       c     which now provides that it is an offence for a person to  amongst other things  assault a constable in the execution of his duty  or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty 

the term  assault   when used in legislation  commonly refers to both common assault and battery  even though the two offences remain distinct  common assault involves intentionally or recklessly causing a person to apprehend the imminent infliction of unlawful force  whilst battery refers to the actual infliction of force 

each state has legislation relating to the act of assault  and offences against the act that constitute assault are heard in the magistrates court of that state or indictable offences are heard in a district or supreme court of that state  the legislation that defines assault of each state outline what the elements are that make up the assault  where the assault is sectioned in legislation or criminal codes  and the penalties that apply for the offence of assault 

in new south wales  the crimes act      defines a range of assault offences deemed more serious than common assault and which attract heavier penalties  these include 



in the united states  assault may be defined as an attempt to commit a battery  however  the crime of assault can encompass acts in which no battery is intended  but the defendant s act nonetheless creates reasonable fear in others that a battery will occur 

assault is typically treated as a misdemeanor and not as a felony  unless the victim is a law enforcement officer   or in new york state for example if the offender is a repeat offender  as a misdemeanor  however  it can still result in incarceration and in a criminal record  the more serious crime of aggravated assault is treated as a felony 

four elements were required at common law 

simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person  the violation of one s personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault  in common law states an assault is not committed by merely  for example  swearing at another  without threat of battery  there can be no assault 

as the criminal law evolved  element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice  these four elements were eventually codified in most states 

laws on assault vary by state  since each state has its own criminal laws  there is no universal assault law  acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as battery  menacing  intimidation  reckless endangerment  etc  in another state  modern american statutes may define assault as including 

the laws on assault differ significantly from state to state as demonstrated below 

in kansas the law on assault states 

in new york state  assault  as defined in the new york state penal code article      requires an actual injury  other states define this as battery  there is no crime of battery in new york  however  in new york if a person threatens another person with imminent injury without engaging in physical contact  that is called  menacing   a person who engages in that behavior is guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree  a class a misdemeanor  punishable with up to one year incarceration  probation for an extended time  and a permanent criminal record  when they threaten to cause physical harm to another person  and guilty of aggravated harassment in the first degree  a class e felony  if they have a previous conviction for the same offense  new york also has specific laws against hazing  when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization 

north dakota law states 

in tennessee assault is defined as follows 

states vary on whether it is possible to commit an  attempted assault  since it can be considered a double inchoate offense 

in some states  consent is a complete defense to assault  in other jurisdictions  mutual consent is an incomplete defense  with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a  petty misdemeanor  

furthermore  the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be human  thus  there is no assault if an ox gores a man  however  the unborn victims of violence act of      treats the fetus as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes  under certain limited circumstances  see h r         p l          

some possible examples of defenses  mitigating circumstances  or failures of proof are 

assault in ancient greece was normally termed hubris  contrary to modern usage  the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening pride  self confidence or arrogance  often resulting in fatal retribution  in ancient greece   hubris  referred to actions which  intentionally or not  shamed and humiliated the victim  and frequently the perpetrator as well  it was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich 

violations of the law against hubris included  what would today be termed  assault and battery  sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities  or the theft of public or sacred property  two well known cases are found in the speeches of demosthenes  a prominent statesman and orator in ancient greece  these two examples occurred when first  meidias punched demosthenes in the face in the theater  against meidias   and second when  in against konon  a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim 

hubris  though not specifically defined  was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical athens  it was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient greek world  that was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride  but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved  the category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse  or a humiliation of a defeated foe  or irreverent   outrageous treatment   in general 

the meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern english usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws  such an act may be referred to as an  act of hubris   or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic  at    greek for  ruin  folly  delusion   is the action performed by the hero  usually because of their hubris  or great pride  that leads to their death or downfall 

crucial to this definition are the ancient greek concepts of honor  tim    and shame  the concept of tim   included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor  but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris  this concept of honor is akin to a zero sum game  rush rehm simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of  insolence  contempt  and excessive violence  







  lfheimr

alfheim     land of the elves  or  elfland    also called ljosalfheim   lj  s  lf a heimr    home of the light elves    is one of the nine worlds and home of the light elves in norse mythology 

  lfheim as an abode of the elves is mentioned only twice in old norse texts 

the eddic poem  gr  mnism  l  describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanza    with 
  dalir call they       the place where ull
a hall for himself hath set 
and   lfheim the gods       to frey once gave
as a tooth gift in ancient times 

a tooth gift was a gift given to an infant on the cutting of the first tooth 

in the   th century eddic prose  gylfaginning   snorri sturluson relates it as the first of a series of abodes in heaven 
that which is called   lfheim is one  where dwell the peoples called  lj  s  lfar   light elves   but the  d  kk  lfar   dark elves  dwell down in the earth  and they are unlike in appearance  but by far more unlike in nature  the light elves are fairer to look upon than the sun  but the dark elves are blacker than pitch 

the account later  in speaking of a hall in the highest heaven called giml   that shall survive when heaven and earth have died  explains 
it is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one  and it is called andlang   andlangr   endlong   but the third heaven is yet above that  and it is called v  dbl  in   v  dbl  inn   wide blue   and in that heaven we think this abode is  but we believe that none but light elves inhabit these mansions now 
it is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to   lfheim or distinct  some texts read vindbl  in   vindbl  inn   wind blue   instead of v  dbl  in 

modern commentators speculate  or sometimes state as fact  that   lfheim was one of the nine worlds   heima   mentioned in stanza    of the eddic poem  v  lusp    






ask and embla

in norse mythology  ask and embla  from     male and female respectively   were the first two humans  created by the gods  the pair are attested in both the  poetic edda   compiled in the   th century from earlier traditional sources  and the  prose edda   written in the   th century by snorri sturluson  in both sources  three gods  one of whom is odin  find ask and embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts  a number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures  and there are occasional references to them in popular culture 

old norse literally means  ash tree  but the etymology of  embla  is uncertain  and two possibilities of the meaning of  embla  are generally proposed  the first meaning   elm tree   is problematic  and is reached by deriving   elm la  from   almil  n  and subsequently to   elm    the second suggestion is  vine   which is reached through   ambil     which may be related to the greek term     itself meaning  vine  liana   the latter etymology has resulted in a number of theories 

according to benjamin thorpe  grimm says the word embla  emla  signifies a busy woman  from amr  ambr  aml  ambl  assiduous labour  the same relation as meshia and meshiane  the ancient persian names of the first man and woman  who were also formed from trees  

in stanza    of the  poetic edda  poem  v  lusp     the v  lva reciting the poem states that h  nir  l    urr and odin once found ask and embla on land  the v  lva says that the two were capable of very little  lacking in    rl  g  and says that they were given three gifts by the three gods 

the meaning of these gifts has been a matter of scholarly disagreement and translations therefore vary 

according to chapter   of the  prose edda  book  gylfaginning   the three brothers vili  v    and odin  are the creators of the first man and woman  the brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there  they took the wood and from it created the first human beings  ask and embla  one of the three gave them the breath of life  the second gave them movement and intelligence  and the third gave them shape  speech  hearing and sight  further  the three gods gave them clothing and names  ask and embla go on to become the progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of midgard 

a proto indo european basis has been theorized for the duo based on the etymology of  embla  meaning  vine   in indo european societies  an analogy is derived from the drilling of fire and sexual intercourse  vines were used as a flammable wood  where they were placed beneath a drill made of harder wood  resulting in fire  further evidence of ritual making of fire in scandinavia has been theorized from a depiction on a stone plate on a bronze age grave in kivik  scania  sweden 

jaan puhvel comments that  ancient myths teem with trite  first couples  of the type of adam and eve  in indo european tradition  these range from the vedic yama and yam   and the iranian ma  ya and ma  y  nag to the icelandic askr and embla  with trees or rocks as preferred raw material  and dragon s teeth or other bony substance occasionally thrown in for good measure  

in his study of the comparative evidence for an origin of mankind from trees in indo european society  anders hultg  rd observes that  myths of the origin of mankind from trees or wood seem to be particularly connected with ancient europe and indo europe and indo european speaking peoples of asia minor and iran  by contrast the cultures of the near east show almost exclusively the type of anthropogonic stories that derive man s origin from clay  earth or blood by means of a divine creation act  

two wooden figures   the braak bog figures   of  more than human height  were unearthed from a peat bog at braak in schleswig  germany  the figures depict a nude male and a nude female  hilda ellis davidson comments that these figures may represent a  lord and lady  of the vanir  a group of norse gods  and that  another memory of  these wooden deities  may survive in the tradition of the creation of ask and embla  the man and woman who founded the human race  created by the gods from trees on the seashore  

a figure named   sc  old english  ash tree   appears as the son of hengest in the anglo saxon genealogy for the kings of kent  this has resulted in a number of theories that the figures may have had an earlier basis in pre norse germanic mythology 

connections have been proposed between ask and embla and the vandal kings assi and ambri  attested in paul the deacon s  th century ad work  origo gentis langobardorum   there  the two ask the god godan  odin  for victory  the name  ambri   like embla  likely derives from   ambil    

a stanza preceding the account of the creation of ask and embla in  v  lusp    provides a catalog of dwarfs  and stanza    has been considered as describing the creation of human forms from the earth  this may potentially mean that dwarfs formed humans  and that the three gods gave them life  carolyne larrington theorizes that humans are metaphorically designated as trees in old norse works  examples include  trees of jewellery  for women and  trees of battle  for men  due to the origin of humankind stemming from trees  ask and embla 

ask and embla have been the subject of a number of references and artistic depictions  a sculpture depicting the two stands in the southern swedish city of s  lvesborg  created in      by stig blomberg  ask and embla are depicted on two of the sixteen wooden panels found on the oslo city hall in oslo  norway  by dagfin werenskiold 






alabama river

the alabama river  in the u s  state of alabama  is formed by the tallapoosa and coosa rivers  which unite about north of montgomery  near the suburb of wetumpka 

the river flows west to selma  then southwest until  about from mobile  it unites with the tombigbee  forming the mobile and tensaw rivers  which discharge into mobile bay 

the run of the alabama is highly meandering  its width varies from   and its depth from   its length as measured by the united states geological survey is   and by steamboat measurement   

the river crosses the richest agricultural and timber districts of the state  railways connect it with the mineral regions of north central alabama 

after the coosa and tallapoosa rivers  the principal tributary of the alabama is the cahaba river  which is about long and joins the alabama river about below selma  the alabama river s main tributary  the coosa river  crosses the mineral region of alabama and is navigable for light draft boats from rome  georgia  to about above wetumpka  about below rome and below greensport   and from wetumpka to its junction with the tallapoosa  the channel of the river has been considerably improved by the federal government 

the navigation of the tallapoosa river     which has its source in paulding county  georgia  and is about long     is prevented by shoals and a fall at tallassee  a few miles north of its junction with the coosa  the alabama is navigable throughout the year 

the river played an important role in the growth of the economy in the region during the   th century as a source of transportation of goods  the river is still used for transportation of farming produce  however  it is not as important as it once was due to the construction of roads and railways 

discovered in       the alabama  coosa  and tallapoosa rivers were central to the homeland of the creek indians before their removal by united states forces to the indian territory in the     s 

the edmund pettus bridge crosses the alabama river near selma  the bridge was the site of noted civil rights marches for voting rights in march       the first became known as  bloody sunday  because the state and county police beat protesters after they crossed out of the city 

the alabama river has three lock and dams between montgomery and the mobile river  the robert f  henry lock   dam is located at river mile        the millers ferry lock   dam is located at river mile        and the claiborne lock   dam is located at river mile      






alain de lille

alain de lille  latin   alanus ab insulis                was a french theologian and poet  he was born in lille  some time before       his exact date of death remains unclear as well  with most research pointing toward it being between    april       and   april      

little is known of his life  however it is clear that alan entered the schools no earlier than the late     s  first attending the school at paris  and then at chartres  he probably studied under masters such as peter abelard  gilbert of poitiers  and thierry of chartres  this is known through the writings of john of salisbury  who is thought to have been a near exact contemporary student of alan of lille  his earliest writings were probably written in the     s  and probably in paris  alan spent many years teaching at the school in paris and he attended the lateran council in       though the only accounts of his lectures seem to show a sort of eccentric style and approach  he was said to have been good friends with many other masters at the school in paris  and taught there  as well as some time in southern france  into his old age  he afterwards inhabited montpellier  he is sometimes called alanus de montepessulano   lived for a time outside the walls of any cloister  and finally retired to c  teaux  where he died in      

he had a very widespread reputation during his lifetime and his knowledge  more varied than profound  caused him to be called  doctor universalis   many of alan s writings are unable to be exactly dated  and the circumstances and details surrounding his writing are often unknown as well  however  it does seem clear that his first notable work   summa quoniam homines   was completed somewhere between      and       with the most conclusive date being       and was probably developed through his lectures at the school in paris  among his very numerous works two poems entitle him to a distinguished place in the latin literature of the middle ages  one of these  the  de planctu naturae   is an ingenious satire on the vices of humanity  he created the allegory of grammatical  conjugation  which was to have its successors throughout the middle ages  the  anticlaudianus   a treatise on morals as allegory  the form of which recalls the pamphlet of claudian against rufinus  is agreeably versified and relatively pure in its latinity 

as a theologian alain de lille shared in the mystic reaction of the second half of the   th century against the scholastic philosophy  his mysticism  however  is far from being as absolute as that of the victorines  in the  anticlaudianus  he sums up as follows  reason  guided by prudence  can unaided discover most of the truths of the physical order  for the apprehension of religious truths it must trust to faith  this rule is completed in his treatise   ars catholicae fidei   as follows  theology itself may be demonstrated by reason  alain even ventures an immediate application of this principle  and tries to prove geometrically the dogmas defined in the creed  this bold attempt is entirely factitious and verbal  and it is only his employment of various terms not generally used in such a connection  axiom  theorem  corollary  etc   that gives his treatise its apparent originality 

alan s philosophy was a sort of mixture of aristotelian logic and neoplatonic philosophy  the platonist seemed to outweigh the aristotelian in alan  but he felt strongly that the divine is all intelligibility and argued this notion through much aristotelian logic combined with pythagorean mathematics 

one of alan s most notable works was one he modeled after boethius     consolation of philosophy   to which he gave the title  de planctu naturae   or  the plaint of nature   and which was most likely written in the late     s  in this work  alan uses prose and verse to illustrate the way in which nature defines its own position as inferior to that of god  he also attempts to illustrate the way in which humanity  through sexual perversion and specifically homosexuality  has defiled itself from nature and god  in  anticlaudianus   another of his notable works  alan uses a poetical dialogue to illustrate the way in which nature comes to the realization of her failure in producing the perfect man  she has only the ability to create a soulless body  and thus she is  persuaded to undertake the journey to heaven to ask for a soul   and  the seven liberal arts produce a chariot for her    the five senses are the horses   the  anticlaudianus  was translated into french and german in the following century  and toward      was re worked into a musical anthology by adam de la bass  e  one of alan s most popular and widely distributed works is his manual on preaching   ars praedicandi   or  the art of preaching   this work shows how alan saw theological education as being a fundamental preliminary step in preaching and strove to give clergyman a manuscript to be  used as a practical manual  when it came to the formation of sermons and art of preaching 

alan wrote three very large theological textbooks  one being his first work   summa quoniam homines   another of his theological textbooks that strove to be more minute in its focus  is his  de fide catholica   dated somewhere between      and       alan sets out to refute heretical views  specifically that of the waldensians and cathars  in his third theological textbook   regulae caelestis iuris   he presents a set of what seems to be theological rules  this was typical of the followers of gilbert of poitiers  of which alan could be associated  other than these theological textbooks  and the aforementioned works of the mixture of prose and poetry  alan of lille had numerous other works on numerous subjects  primarily including speculative theology  theoretical moral theology  practical moral theology  and various collections of poems 

alain de lille has often been confounded with other persons named alain  in particular with another alanus  alain  bishop of auxerre   alan  abbot of tewkesbury  alain de podio  etc  certain facts of their lives have been attributed to him  as well as some of their works  thus the  life of st bernard  should be ascribed to alain of auxerre and the  commentary upon merlin  to alan of tewkesbury  alan of lille was not the author of a  memoriale rerum difficilium   published under his name  nor of  moralium dogma philosophorum   nor of the satirical  apocalypse of golias  once attributed to him  and it is exceedingly doubtful whether the  dicta alani de lapide philosophico  really issued from his pen  on the other hand  it now seems practically demonstrated that alain de lille was the author of the  ars catholicae fidei  and the treatise  contra haereticos  

in his sermons on capital sins  alain argued that sodomy and homicide are the most serious sins  since they call forth the wrath of god  which led to the destruction of sodom and gomorrah  his chief work on penance  the  liber poenitenitalis  dedicated to henry de sully  exercised great influence on the many manuals of penance produced as a result of the fourth lateran council  alain s identification of the sins against nature included bestiality  masturbation  oral and anal intercourse  incest  adultery and rape  in addition to his battle against moral decay  alan wrote a work against islam  judaism and christian heretics dedicated to william viii of montpellier

alemanni

the alemanni  also  alamanni    suebi   swabians   were a confederation of germanic tribes on the upper rhine river  first mentioned by cassius dio in the context of the campaign of caracalla of      the alemanni captured the in      and later expanded into present day alsace  and northern switzerland  leading to the establishment of the old high german language in those regions  by the eighth century named  alamannia  

in      the alemanni were conquered by frankish leader clovis and incorporated into his dominions  mentioned as still pagan allies of the christian franks  the alemanni were gradually christianized during the seventh century  the is a record of their customary law during this period  until the eighth century  frankish suzerainty over alemannia was mostly nominal  after an uprising by theudebald  duke of alamannia  though  carloman executed the alamannic nobility and installed frankish dukes  
during the later and weaker years of the carolingian empire  the alemannic counts became almost independent  and a struggle for supremacy took place between them and the bishopric of constance  the chief family in alamannia was that of the counts of   who were sometimes called margraves  and one of whom  burchard ii  established the duchy of swabia  which was recognized by henry the fowler in     and became a stem duchy of the holy roman empire 

the area settled by the alemanni corresponds roughly to the area where alemannic german dialects remain spoken  including german swabia and baden  french alsace  german speaking switzerland  liechtenstein and austrian vorarlberg  

the french language name of germany    is derived from their name  from old french  aleman t    from french loaned into a number of other languages 

according to gaius asinius quadratus  quoted in the mid sixth century by byzantine historian agathias   the name  alamanni                      means  all men   it indicates that they were a conglomeration drawn from various germanic tribes  the romans and the greeks called them as such mentioned  this derivation was accepted by edward gibbon  in his  decline and fall of the roman empire  and by the anonymous contributor of notes assembled from the papers of nicolas fr  ret  published in       who noted that it was the name used by outsiders for those who called themselves the  suebi  
this etymology has remained the standard derivation of the name 
walafrid strabo in the  th century remarked  in discussing the people of switzerland and the surrounding regions  that only foreigners called them the alemanni  but that they gave themselves the name of suebi 

an alternative suggestion by francis palgrave proposed derivation from   alah   sanctuary  

the  suebi  are given the alternative name of  ziuwari   as  cyuuari   in an old high german gloss  interpreted by jacob grimm as  martem colentes    worshippers of mars   

the alemanni were first mentioned by cassius dio describing the campaign of caracalla in      at that time  they apparently dwelt in the basin of the main  to the south of the chatti 

cassius dio portrays the alemanni as victims of this treacherous emperor  they had asked for his help  according to dio  but instead he colonized their country  changed their place names  and executed their warriors under a pretext of coming to their aid  when he became ill  the alemanni claimed to have put a hex on him  caracalla  it was claimed  tried to counter this influence by invoking his ancestral spirits 

in retribution  caracalla then led the legio ii  traiana fortis  against the alemanni  who lost and were pacified for a time  the legion was as a result honored with the name  germanica   the fourth century fictional historia augusta   life of antoninus caracalla   relates        that caracalla then assumed the name  alemannicus  at which helvius pertinax jested that he should really be called  geticus maximus   because in the year before he had murdered his brother  geta 

through much of his short reign  caracalla was known for unpredictable and arbitrary operations launched by surprise after a pretext of peace negotiations  if he had any reasons of state for such actions  they remained unknown to his contemporaries  whether or not the alemanni had been previously neutral  they were certainly further influenced by caracalla to become thereafter notoriously implacable enemies of rome 

this mutually antagonistic relationship is perhaps the reason why the roman writers persisted in calling the alemanni  barbari   meaning  savages   the archaeology  however  shows that they were largely romanized  lived in roman style houses and used roman artifacts  the alemannic women having adopted the roman fashion of the  tunica  even earlier than the men 

most of the alemanni were probably at the time  in fact  resident in or close to the borders of germania superior  although dio is the earliest writer to mention them  ammianus marcellinus used the name to refer to germans on the limes germanicus in the time of trajan s governorship of the province shortly after it was formed  around       ad  at that time  the entire frontier was being fortified for the first time  trees from the earliest fortifications found in germania inferior are dated by dendrochronology to        ad 

ammianus relates  xvii       that much later the emperor julian undertook a punitive expedition against the alemanni  who by then were in alsace  and crossed the main  latin  menus    entering the forest  where the trails were blocked by felled trees  as winter was upon them  they reoccupied a
 fortification which was founded on the soil of the alemanni that trajan wished to be called with his own name  

in this context  the use of alemanni is possibly an anachronism  but it reveals that ammianus believed they were the same people  which is consistent with the location of the alemanni of caracalla s campaigns 

the early detailed source  the  germania  of tacitus  has sometimes been interpreted in such a way as to provide yet other historical problems  in chapter    the hermunduri were a tribe certainly located in the region that later became thuringia  tacitus stated that they traded with rhaetia  which in ptolemy is located across the danube from germania superior  a logical conclusion to draw is that the hermunduri extended over later swabia and therefore the alemanni originally derived from the hermunduri 

however  no hermunduri appear in ptolemy  though after the time of ptolemy  the hermunduri joined with the marcomanni in the wars of           against the empire  a careful reading of tacitus provides one solution  he says that the source of the elbe is among the hermunduri  somewhat to the east of the upper main  he places them also between the naristi  varisti   whose location at the very edge of the ancient black forest is well known  and the marcomanni and quadi  moreover  the hermunduri were broken in the marcomannic wars and made a separate peace with rome  the alemanni thus were probably not primarily the hermunduri  although some elements of them may have been present in the mix of peoples at that time that became alemannian 

before the mention of alemanni in the time of caracalla  one would search in vain for alemanni in the moderately detailed geography of southern germany in claudius ptolemy  written in greek in the mid second century  at that time  the people who later used that name likely were known by other designations 

nevertheless  some conclusions can be drawn from ptolemy  germania superior is easily identified  following up the rhine one comes to a town  mattiacum  which must be at the border of the roman germany  vicinity of wiesbaden   upstream from it and between the rhine and abnoba  in the black forest  are the ingriones  intuergi  vangiones  caritni and vispi  some of whom were there since the days of the early empire or before  on the other side of the northern black forest were the chatti about where hesse is today  on the lower main 

historic swabia was eventually replaced by today s baden w  rttemberg  but it had been the most significant territory of mediaeval alamannia  comprising all germania superior and territory east to bavaria  it did not include the upper main  but that is where caracalla campaigned  moreover  the territory of germania superior was not originally included among the alemanni s possessions 

however  if one looks for the peoples in the region from the upper main in the north  south to the danube and east to the czech republic where the quadi and marcomanni were located  ptolemy does not give any tribes  the tubanti are just south of the chatti and at the other end of what was then the black forest  the varisti  whose location is known  one possible reason for this distribution is that the population preferred not to live in the forest except in troubled times  the region between the forest and the danube  though  included about a dozen settlements  or  cantons  

ptolemy s view of germans in the region indicates that the tribal structure had lost its grip in the black forest region and was replaced by a canton structure  the tribes stayed in the roman province  perhaps because the romans offered stability  also  caracalla perhaps felt more comfortable about campaigning in the upper main because he was not declaring war on any specific historic tribe  such as the chatti or cherusci  against whom rome had suffered grievous losses  by caracalla s time  the name alemanni was being used by cantons themselves banding together for purposes of supporting a citizen army  the  war bands   

the term suebi has a double meaning in the sources  on the one hand tacitus   germania  tells us  chapters         that they occupy more than half of germany  use a distinctive hair style  and are spiritually centered on the semnones  on the other hand  the suebi of the upper danube are described as though they were a tribe 

the solution to the puzzle as well as explaining the historical circumstances leading to the choice of the agri decumates as a defensive point and the concentration of germans there are probably to be found in the german attack on the gallic fortified town of vesontio in    bc  the upper rhine and danube appear to form a funnel pointing straight at vesontio 

julius caesar in  gallic wars  tells us        that ariovistus had gathered an army from a wide region of germany  but especially the harudes  marcomanni  triboci  vangiones  nemetes and sedusii  the suebi were being invited to join  they lived in     cantons       from which      young men per year were chosen for military service  a citizen army by our standards and by comparison with the roman professional army 

ariovistus had become involved in an invasion of gaul  which the german wished to settle  intending to take the strategic town of vesontio  he concentrated his forces on the rhine near lake constance  and when the suebi arrived  he crossed  the gauls had called to rome for military aid  caesar occupied the town first and defeated the germans before its walls  slaughtering most of the german army as it tried to flee across the river      ff   he did not pursue the retreating remnants  leaving what was left of the german army and their dependents intact on the other side of the rhine 

the gauls were ambivalent in their policies toward the romans  in    bc the treveri broke their alliance and attempted to break free of rome  caesar foresaw that they would now attempt to ally themselves with the germans  he crossed the rhine to forestall that event  a successful strategy  remembering their expensive defeat at the battle of vesontio  the germans withdrew to the black forest  concentrating there a mixed population dominated by suebi  as they had left their tribal homes behind  they probably took over all the former celtic cantons along the danube 
the alemanni were continually engaged in conflicts with the roman empire in the  rd and  th centuries  they launched a major invasion of gaul and northern italy in      when the romans were forced to denude much of their german frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion of the goths from the east  their raids throughout the three parts of gaul were traumatic  gregory of tours  died ca      mentions their destructive force at the time of valerian and gallienus              when the alemanni assembled under their  king   whom he calls chrocus  who  by the advice  it is said  of his wicked mother  and overran the whole of the gauls  and destroyed from their foundations all the temples which had been built in ancient times  and coming to clermont he set on fire  overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call  vasso galatae  in the gallic tongue   martyring many christians   historia francorum  book i           thus  th century gallo romans of gregory s class  surrounded by the ruins of roman temples and public buildings  attributed the destruction they saw to the plundering raids of the alemanni 

in the early summer of      the emperor gallienus halted their advance into italy  but then had to deal with the goths  when the gothic campaign ended in roman victory at the battle of naissus in september  gallienus  successor claudius gothicus turned north to deal with the alemanni  who were swarming over all italy north of the po river 

after efforts to secure a peaceful withdrawal failed  claudius forced the alemanni to battle at the battle of lake benacus in november  the alemanni were routed  forced back into germany  and did not threaten roman territory for many years afterwards 

their most famous battle against rome took place in argentoratum  strasbourg   in      where they were defeated by julian  later emperor of rome  and their king chnodomarius was taken prisoner to rome 

on january         the alemanni yet again crossed the frozen rhine in large numbers  to invade the gallic provinces  this time being defeated by valentinian  see battle of solicinium   in the great mixed invasion of      the alemanni appear to have crossed the rhine river a final time  conquering and then settling what is today alsace and a large part of the swiss plateau  the crossing is described in wallace breem s historical novel  eagle in the snow   the chronicle of fredegar gives the account  at  alba augusta   alba la romaine  the devastation was so complete  that the christian bishop retired to viviers  but in gregory s account at mende in loz  re  also deep in the heart of gaul  bishop privatus was forced to sacrifice to idols in the very cave where he was later venerated  it is thought this detail may be a generic literary ploy to epitomize the horrors of barbarian violence 


the kingdom of alamannia between strasbourg and augsburg lasted until      when the alemanni were conquered by clovis i at the battle of tolbiac  the war of clovis with the alemanni forms the setting for the conversion of clovis  briefly treated by gregory of tours   book ii     subsequently  the alemanni formed part of the frankish dominions and were governed by a frankish duke 

in      carloman ended an uprising by summarily executing all alemannic nobility at the blood court at cannstatt  and for the following century  alemannia was ruled by frankish dukes  following the treaty of verdun of      alemannia became a province of the eastern kingdom of louis the german  the precursor of the holy roman empire  the duchy persisted until      

the german spoken today over the range of the former alemanni is termed alemannic german  and is recognised among the subgroups of the high german languages  alemannic runic inscriptions such as those on the pforzen buckle are among the earliest testimonies of old high german 
the high german consonant shift is thought to have originated around the  th century either in alemannia or among the lombards  before that the dialect spoken by alemannic tribes was little different from that of other west germanic peoples 

 alemannia  lost its distinct jurisdictional identity when charles martel absorbed it into the frankish empire  early in the  th century  today   alemannic  is a linguistic term  referring to alemannic german  encompassing the dialects of the southern two thirds of baden w  rttemberg  german state   in western bavaria  german state   in vorarlberg  austrian state   swiss german in switzerland and the alsatian language of the alsace  france  

the alemanni established a series of territorially defined  pagi   cantons  on the east bank of the rhine  the exact number and extent of these  pagi  is unclear and probably changed over time 

 pagi   usually pairs of  pagi  combined  formed kingdoms   regna   which  it is generally believed  were permanent and hereditary  ammianus describes alemanni rulers with various terms   reges excelsiores ante alios    paramount kings     reges proximi    neighbouring kings     reguli    petty kings   and  regales    princes    this may be a formal hierarchy  or they may be vague  overlapping terms  or a combination of both  in      there appear to have been two paramount kings  chnodomar and westralp  who probably acted as presidents of the confederation and seven other kings   reges    their territories were small and mostly strung along the rhine  although a few were in the hinterland   it is possible that the  reguli  were the rulers of the two  pagi  in each kingdom  underneath the royal class were the nobles  called  optimates  by the romans  and warriors  called  armati  by the romans   the warriors consisted of professional warbands and levies of free men  each nobleman could raise an average of c     warriors 

the christianization of the alemanni took place during merovingian times   th to  th centuries   we know that in the  th century  the alemanni were predominantly pagan  and in the  th century  they were predominantly christian  the intervening  th century was a period of genuine syncretism during which christian symbolism and doctrine gradually grew in influence 

some scholars have speculated that members of the alemannic elite such as king gibuld due to visigothic influence may have been converted to arianism even in the later  th century 

in the mid  th century  the byzantine historian agathias records  in the context of the wars of the goths and franks against byzantium  that the alemanni fighting among the troops of frankish king theudebald were like the franks in all respects except religion  since
he also spoke of the particular ruthlessness of the alemanni in destroying christian sanctuaries and plundering churches while the genuine franks were respectful towards those sanctuaries  agathias expresses his hope that the alemanni would assume better manners through prolonged contact with the franks  which is by all appearances  in a manner of speaking  what eventually happened 

apostles of the alemanni were columbanus and his disciple saint gall  jonas of bobbio records that columbanus was active in bregenz  where he disrupted a beer sacrifice to wodan  despite these activities  for some time  the alemanni seem to have continued their pagan cult activities  with only superficial or syncretistic christian elements  in particular  there is no change in burial practice  and tumulus warrior graves continued to be erected throughout merovingian times  syncretism of traditional germanic animal style with christian symbolism is also present in artwork  but christian symbolism becomes more and more prevalent during the  th century  unlike the later christianization of the saxons and of the slavs  the alemanni seem to have adopted christianity gradually  and voluntarily  spread in emulation of the merovingian elite 

from c  the    s to the    s  there was a surge of alemannic elder futhark inscriptions  about    specimens have survived  roughly half of them on fibulae  others on belt buckles  see pforzen buckle  b  lach fibula  and other jewelry and weapon parts  use of runes subsides with the advance of christianity 
the nordendorf fibula  early  th century  clearly records pagan theonyms   loga  orewodanwigi  onar   read as  wodan and donar are magicians sorcerers   but this may be interpreted as either a pagan invocation of the powers of these deities  or a christian protective charm against them 
a runic inscription on a fibula found at bad ems reflects christian pious sentiment  and is also explicitly marked with a christian cross   reading  god fura dih deofile        god for before you  theophilus    or alternatively  god before you  devil     dated to between ad     and      it marks the end of the native alemannic tradition of runic literacy  bad ems is in rhineland palatinate  on the northwestern boundary of alemannic settlement  where frankish influence would have been strongest 

the establishment of the bishopric of konstanz cannot be dated exactly and was possibly undertaken by columbanus himself  before       in any case  it existed by      when gunzo appointed john of grab bishop  constance was a missionary bishopric in newly converted lands  and did not look back on late roman church history unlike the raetian bishopric of chur  established      and basel  an episcopal seat from      and which continued the line of bishops of augusta raurica  see bishop of basel   the establishment of the church as an institution recognized by worldly rulers is also visible in legal history  in the early  th century  pactus alamannorum  hardly ever mentions the special privileges of the church  while lantfrid s  lex alamannorum  of     has an entire chapter reserved for ecclesial matters alone

the exchange grew out of the loosely organized curb market of curbstone brokers on broad street in manhattan  efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the   th century under emanuel s  mendels and carl h  pforzheimer  the curb brokers had been kicked out of the mills building front by       and had moved to the pavement outside the blair building where cabbies lined up  there they were given a  little domain of asphalt  fenced off by the police on broad street between exchange place and beaver street  as of       the curb market operated starting at    am  each day except sundays  until a gong at   pm  orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages  with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage 

as of       e  s  mendels gave the brokers rules  by right of seniority   but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing  according to the  times   this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized  the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships  however  in      the new york curb market agency was established  which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers  organized by mendels  the informal curb association formed in      to weed out undesirables  the curb exchange was for years at odds with the new york stock exchange  nyse   or  big board   operating several buildings away  explained the  new york times  in       the big board looked at the curb as  a trading place for  cats and dogs    on april          however  when the nyse abolished its unlisted department  the nyse stocks  made homeless by the abolition  were  refused domicile  by the curb brokers on broad street until they had complied with the  curb list  of requirements  in       mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the new york curb market association  which can be considered the first formal constitution of american stock exchange 

in       journalist edwin c  hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower broad street was a  roaring  swirling whirlpool  that  tears control of a gold mine from an unlucky operator  and pauses to auction a puppy dog  it is like nothing else under the astonished sky that is its only roof  munsey s magazine after a group of curb brokers formed a real estate company to design a building  starrett   van vleck designed the new exchange building on greenwich street in lower manhattan between thames and rector  at    trinity place  it opened in       and the curbstone brokers moved indoors on june           in       the new york curb market changed its name to the new york curb exchange  within no time  the curb exchange became the leading international stock market  listing more foreign issues than all other u s  securities markets combined 

george rea was approached about the position of president of the new york curb exchange in       he was unanimously elected as the first paid president in the history of the curb exchange  he was paid         per year and held the position for   years before offering his resignation in       he left the position having  done such a good job that there is virtually no need for a full time successor  

in      the curb exchange was renamed the american stock exchange  the exchange was shaken by a scandal in       and in      began a reorganization  its reputation recently damaged by charges of mismanagement  in      the american stock exchange named edwin etherington its president  writes cnn  he and executive vice president paul kolton were  tapped in      to clean up and reinvigorate the scandal plagued american stock exchange   at amex for five years  he was credited with improving opportunities for minorities and women  in       johnson products company became the first african american owned company to be listed on the american stock exchange 

as of       it was the second largest stock exchange in the united states  paul kolton succeeded ralph s  saul as amex president on june           making him the first person to be selected from within the exchange to serve as its leader  succeeding ralph s  saul  who announced his resignation in march       in november       kolton was named as the exchange s first chief executive officer and its first salaried top executive  as chairman  kolton oversaw the introduction of options trading  kolton opposed the idea of a merger with the new york stock exchange while he headed the exchange saying that  two independent  viable exchanges are much more likely to be responsive to new pressures and public needs than a single institution   kolton announced in july      that he would be leaving his position at the american exchange in november of that year 

in       thomas peterffy purchased a seat on the american stock exchange and played a role in developing the electronic trading of securities  peterffy created a major stir among traders by introducing handheld computers onto the trading floor in the early     s 

as of       amex was the only u s  stock market to permit the transmission of buy and sell orders through hand signals 

in october      nyse euronext completed acquisition of the amex for      million in stock  before the closing of the acquisition  nyse euronext announced that the amex would be integrated with the alternext european small cap exchange and renamed the nyse alternext u s  the american stock exchange merged with the new york stock exchange  nyse euronext  on october          post merger  the amex equities business was branded  nyse alternext us   as part of the re branding exercise  nyse alternext us was re branded as nyse amex equities  on december          the curb exchange building at    trinity place was closed  and the amex equities trading floor was moved to the nyse trading floor at    wall street     years after its      opening  the old new york curb market building was empty but remained standing  in march       nyse alternext u s  was changed to nyse amex equities  on may           nyse amex equities changed its name to nyse mkt llc 

in june       a competing stock exchange iex  which operated with a     microsecond delay in trading   gained approval from the sec  despite lobbying protests by the nyse and other exchanges and trading firms  
on july           the nyse renamed nyse mkt to nyse american  and announced plans to introduce its own     microsecond  speed bump  in trading on the small and mid cap company exchange

alfred russel wallace

alfred russel wallace    january       november       was a british naturalist  explorer  geographer  anthropologist  and biologist  he is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection  his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of charles darwin s writings in       this prompted darwin to publish his own ideas in  on the origin of species   wallace did extensive fieldwork  first in the amazon river basin and then in the malay archipelago  where he identified the faunal divide now termed the wallace line  which separates the indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts  a western portion in which the animals are largely of asian origin  and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect australasia 

he was considered the   th century s leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the  father of biogeography   wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the   th century and made many other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides being co discoverer of natural selection  these included the concept of warning colouration in animals  and the wallace effect  a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation  wallace s      book  man s place in the universe  was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets  he was also one of the first scientists to write a serious exploration of the subject of whether there was life on mars 

wallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas  such as evolution   his advocacy of spiritualism and his belief in a non material origin for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of the scientific establishment 

aside from scientific work  he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system  capitalism  in   th century britain  his interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity  he was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues  his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in singapore  indonesia and malaysia   the malay archipelago   was both popular and highly regarded  since its publication in      it has never been out of print 

wallace had financial difficulties throughout much of his life  his amazon and far eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and  after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments  he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced  unlike some of his contemporaries in the british scientific community  such as darwin and charles lyell  he had no family wealth to fall back on  and he was unsuccessful in finding a long term salaried position  receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension  through darwin s efforts  in      

alfred wallace was born in the welsh village of llanbadoc  near usk  monmouthshire  he was the seventh of nine children of thomas vere wallace and mary anne greenell  mary anne was english  thomas wallace was probably of scottish ancestry  his family  like many wallaces  claimed a connection to william wallace  a leader of scottish forces during the wars of scottish independence in the   th century  thomas wallace graduated in law  but never practised law  he owned some income generating property  but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family s financial position  his mother was from a middle class english family from hertford  north of london  when wallace was five years old  his family moved to hertford  there he attended hertford grammar school until financial difficulties forced his family to withdraw him in       when he was aged    
wallace then moved to london to board with his older brother john  a    year old apprentice builder  this was a stopgap measure until william  his oldest brother  was ready to take him on as an apprentice surveyor  while in london  alfred attended lectures and read books at the london mechanics institute  here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the welsh social reformer robert owen and of thomas paine  he left london in      to live with william and work as his apprentice for six years 

at the end of       they moved to kington  hereford  near the welsh border  before eventually settling at neath in glamorgan in wales  between      and       wallace did land surveying work in the countryside of the west of england and wales  by the end of       william s business had declined due to difficult economic conditions  and wallace  at the age of     left in january 

one result of wallace s early travels is a modern controversy about his nationality  since wallace was born in monmouthshire  some sources have considered him to be welsh  however  some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was welsh  his family only briefly lived in monmouthshire  the welsh people wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be english  and because wallace himself consistently referred to himself as english rather than welsh  even when writing about his time in wales   one wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an englishman born in wales 

after a brief period of unemployment  he was hired as a master at the collegiate school in leicester to teach drawing  mapmaking  and surveying  wallace spent many hours at the library in leicester  he read  an essay on the principle of population  by thomas robert malthus  and one evening he met the entomologist henry bates  bates was    years old  and in      he had published a paper on beetles in the journal  zoologist   he befriended wallace and started him collecting insects  william died in march       and wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother s firm in neath  but his brother john and he were unable to make the business work  after a few months  wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the vale of neath 

wallace s work on the survey involved spending a lot of time outdoors in the countryside  allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects  wallace persuaded his brother john to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm  which carried out a number of projects  including the design of a building for the neath mechanics  institute  founded in       william jevons  the founder of that institute  was impressed by wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering  in the autumn of       john and he purchased a cottage near neath  where they lived with their mother and sister fanny  his father had died in       

during this period  he read avidly  exchanging letters with bates about robert chambers  anonymously published evolutionary treatise  vestiges of the natural history of creation   charles darwin s  the voyage of the beagle   and charles lyell s  principles of geology  

inspired by the chronicles of earlier travelling naturalists  including alexander von humboldt  charles darwin and especially william henry edwards  wallace decided that he too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist  in       wallace and henry bates left for brazil aboard the  mischief   their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in the amazon rainforest for their private collections  selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in britain in order to fund the trip  wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the transmutation of species 

wallace and bates spent most of their first year collecting near bel  m  then explored inland separately  occasionally meeting to discuss their findings  in       they were briefly joined by another young explorer  botanist richard spruce  along with wallace s younger brother herbert  herbert left soon thereafter  dying two years later from yellow fever   but spruce  like bates  would spend over ten years collecting in south america 

wallace continued charting the rio negro for four years  collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography  flora  and fauna  on    july       wallace embarked for the uk on the brig  helen   after    days at sea  the ship s cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship  all of the specimens wallace had on the ship  mostly collected during the last  and most interesting  two years of his trip  were lost  he managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches and little else 

wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig  jordeson   which was sailing from cuba to london  the  jordeson  s provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers  but after a difficult passage on very short rations the ship finally reached its destination on   october      

after his return to the uk  wallace spent    months in london living on the insurance payment for his lost collection and selling a few specimens that had been shipped back to britain prior to his starting his exploration of the rio negro until the indian town of jativa on orinoco river basin and as far west as mic  ru  mit    on the uaup  s river  he was deeply impressed by the grandeur of the virgin forest  by the variety and beauty of the butterflies and birds  and by his first encounter with indians on the uaup  s river area  an experience he never forgot  during this period  despite having lost almost all of the notes from his south american expedition  he wrote six academic papers  which included  on the monkeys of the amazon   and two books   palm trees of the amazon and their uses  and  travels on the amazon   he also made connections with a number of other british naturalists   most significantly  darwin 

from      to       age    to     wallace travelled through the malay archipelago or east indies  now singapore  malaysia and indonesia   to collect specimens for sale and to study natural history  a set of    bird skeletons he collected in indonesia and associated documentation can be found in the cambridge university museum of zoology  his observations of the marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the wallace line 

wallace collected more than         specimens in the malay archipelago  more than        beetles alone   several thousand of them represented species new to science  one of his better known species descriptions during this trip is that of the gliding tree frog  rhacophorus nigropalmatus   known as wallace s flying frog  while he was exploring the archipelago  he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection  in      he sent an article outlining his theory to darwin  it was published  along with a description of darwin s own theory  in the same year 

accounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in      as  the malay archipelago   which became one of the most popular books of scientific exploration of the   th century  and has never been out of print  it was praised by scientists such as darwin  to whom the book was dedicated   and charles lyell  and by non scientists such as the novelist joseph conrad  who called it his  favorite bedside companion  and used it as source of information for several of his novels  especially  lord jim  

in       wallace returned to england  where he moved in with his sister fanny sims and her husband thomas  while recovering from his travels  wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the zoological society of london  later that year  he visited darwin at down house  and became friendly with both charles lyell and herbert spencer  during the     s  wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection  he also corresponded with darwin about a variety of topics  including sexual selection  warning colouration  and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species  in       he began investigating spiritualism 

after a year of courtship  wallace became engaged in      to a young woman whom  in his autobiography  he would only identify as miss l  miss l  was the daughter of lewis leslie who played chess with wallace  however  to wallace s great dismay  she broke off the engagement  in       wallace married annie mitten  wallace had been introduced to mitten through the botanist richard spruce  who had befriended wallace in brazil and who was also a good friend of annie mitten s father  william mitten  an expert on mosses  in       wallace built the dell  a house of concrete  on land he leased in grays in essex  where he lived until       the wallaces had three children  herbert                violet                and william               

in the late     s and     s  wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family  while he was in the malay archipelago  the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money  which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for wallace  however  on his return to the uk  wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money  and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of  the malay archipelago  

despite assistance from his friends  he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum  to remain financially solvent  wallace worked grading government examinations  wrote    papers for publication between      and      for various modest sums  and was paid by lyell and darwin to help edit some of their own works 

in       wallace needed a       advance from the publisher of  the geographical distribution of animals  to avoid having to sell some of his personal property  darwin was very aware of wallace s financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science  when the       annual pension was awarded in       it helped to stabilise wallace s financial position by supplementing the income from his writings 

john stuart mill was impressed by remarks criticising english society that wallace had included in  the malay archipelago   mill asked him to join the general committee of his land tenure reform association  but the association dissolved after mill s death in       wallace had written only a handful of articles on political and social issues between      and      when  at the age of     he entered the debates over trade policy and land reform in earnest  he believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people  thus breaking the often abused power of wealthy landowners in british society 

in       wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed land nationalisation society  in the next year  he published a book   land nationalisation  its necessity and its aims   on the subject  he criticised the uk s free trade policies for the negative impact they had on working class people  in       wallace read  looking backward  by edward bellamy and declared himself a socialist  despite his earlier foray as a speculative investor  after reading  progress and poverty   the best selling book by the progressive land reformist henry george  wallace described it as  undoubtedly the most remarkable and important book of the present century  

wallace opposed eugenics  an idea supported by other prominent   th century evolutionary thinkers  on the grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit  in the      article  human selection  he wrote   those who succeed in the race for wealth are by no means the best or the most intelligent        in       wallace wrote a paper advocating a pure paper money system  not backed by silver or gold  which impressed the economist irving fisher so much that he dedicated his      book  stabilizing the dollar  to wallace 

wallace wrote on other social and political topics including his support for women s suffrage  and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of militarism  in an essay published in      wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people      that all modern wars are dynastic  that they are caused by the ambition  the interests  the jealousies  and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers  or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers  and that the results of war are never good for the people  who yet bear all its burthens   in a letter published by the daily mail in       with aviation in its infancy  he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft  arguing against the idea     that this new horror is  inevitable   and that all we can do is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins   for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of  say  ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy s capital from an invisible flight of airships  

in       wallace published a book entitled  the wonderful century  its successes and its failures  about developments in the   th century  the first part of the book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century  the second part covered what wallace considered to be its social failures including  the destruction and waste of wars and arms races  the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked  a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals  abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums  the environmental damage caused by capitalism  and the evils of european colonialism  wallace continued his social activism for the rest of his life  publishing the book  the revolt of democracy  just weeks before his death 

wallace continued his scientific work in parallel with his social commentary  in       he published  island life  as a sequel to  the geographic distribution of animals   in november       wallace began a ten month trip to the united states to give a series of popular lectures  most of the lectures were on darwinism  evolution through natural selection   but he also gave speeches on biogeography  spiritualism  and socio economic reform  during the trip  he was reunited with his brother john who had emigrated to california years before  he also spent a week in colorado  with the american botanist alice eastwood as his guide  exploring the flora of the rocky mountains and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how glaciation might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of europe  asia and north america  which he published in      in the paper  english and american flowers   he met many other prominent american naturalists and viewed their collections  his      book  darwinism  used information he collected on his american trip  and information he had compiled for the lectures 

on   november       wallace died at home in the country house he called old orchard  which he had built a decade earlier  he was    years old  his death was widely reported in the press   the new york times  called him  the last of the giants belonging to that wonderful group of intellectuals that included  among others  darwin  huxley  spencer  lyell  and owen  whose daring investigations revolutionised and evolutionised the thought of the century   another commentator in the same edition said  no apology need be made for the few literary or scientific follies of the author of that great book on the  malay archipelago   

some of wallace s friends suggested that he be buried in westminster abbey  but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at broadstone  dorset  several prominent british scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of wallace placed in westminster abbey near where darwin had been buried  the medallion was unveiled on   november      

unlike darwin  wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in the transmutation of species  the concept had been advocated by jean baptiste lamarck  geoffroy saint hilaire  erasmus darwin  and robert grant  among others  it was widely discussed  but not generally accepted by leading naturalists  and was considered to have radical  even revolutionary connotations 

prominent anatomists and geologists such as georges cuvier  richard owen  adam sedgwick  and charles lyell attacked it vigorously  it has been suggested that wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics  religion and science  and because he was unusually open to marginal  even fringe  ideas in science 

he was also profoundly influenced by robert chambers  work   vestiges of the natural history of creation   a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in      that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system  the earth  and living things  wallace wrote to henry bates in      

in       he wrote to bates 
wallace deliberately planned some of his field work to test the hypothesis that under an evolutionary scenario closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories  during his work in the amazon basin  he came to realise that geographical barriers   such as the amazon and its major tributaries   often separated the ranges of closely allied species  and he included these observations in his      paper  on the monkeys of the amazon   near the end of the paper he asks the question   are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country  

in february       while working in sarawak on the island of borneo  wallace wrote  on the law which has regulated the introduction of new species   a paper which was published in the  annals and magazine of natural history  in september       in this paper  he discussed observations regarding the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species  what would become known as biogeography  his conclusion that  every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species  has come to be known as the  sarawak law   wallace thus answered the question he had posed in his earlier paper on the monkeys of the amazon river basin  although it contained no mention of any possible mechanisms for evolution  this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later 

the paper shook charles lyell s belief that species were immutable  although his friend charles darwin had written to him in      expressing support for transmutation  lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea  around the start of       he told darwin about wallace s paper  as did edward blyth who thought it  good  upon the whole       wallace has  i think put the matter well  and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into  species    despite this hint  darwin mistook wallace s conclusion for the progressive creationism of the time and wrote that it was  nothing very new      uses my simile of tree  but  it seems all creation with him   lyell was more impressed  and opened a notebook on species  in which he grappled with the consequences  particularly for human ancestry  darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend joseph hooker and now  for the first time  he spelt out the full details of natural selection to lyell  although lyell could not agree  he urged darwin to publish to establish priority  darwin demurred at first  then began writing up a  species sketch  of his continuing work in may      

by february       wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in the malay archipelago of the reality of evolution  as he later wrote in his autobiography 

according to his autobiography  it was while he was in bed with a fever that wallace thought about thomas robert malthus s idea of positive checks on human population growth and came up with the idea of natural selection  wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of ternate at the time  but historians have questioned this  saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time  he was on the island of gilolo  from      to      he rented a house on ternate from the dutchman maarten dirk van renesse van duivenbode  he used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as gilolo 

wallace describes how he discovered natural selection as follows 

wallace had once briefly met darwin  and was one of the correspondents whose observations darwin used to support his own theories  although wallace s first letter to darwin has been lost  wallace carefully kept the letters he received  in the first letter  dated   may       darwin commented that wallace s letter of    october which he had recently received  as well as wallace s paper  on the law which has regulated the introduction of new species  of       showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions  and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time  the second letter  dated    december       said how glad he was that wallace was theorising about distribution  adding that  without speculation there is no good and original observation  while commenting that  i believe i go much further than you   wallace trusted darwin s opinion on the matter and sent him his february      essay   on the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from the original type   with the request that darwin would review it and pass it on to charles lyell if he thought it worthwhile  although wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the malay archipelago  the ternate essay was in a private letter  on    june       darwin received the essay from wallace  while wallace s essay obviously did not employ darwin s term  natural selection   it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures  in this sense  it was very similar to the theory that darwin had worked on for twenty years  but had yet to publish  darwin sent the manuscript to charles lyell with a letter saying  he could not have made a better short abstract  even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters      he does not say he wishes me to publish  but i shall  of course  at once write and offer to send to any journal   distraught about the illness of his baby son  darwin put the problem to charles lyell and joseph hooker  who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted darwin s priority  wallace s essay was presented to the linnean society of london on   july       along with excerpts from an essay which darwin had disclosed privately to hooker in      and a letter darwin had written to asa gray in      

communication with wallace in the far off malay archipelago was impossible without months of delay  so he was not part of this rapid publication  fortunately  wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact  happy that he had been included at all  and never expressed public or private bitterness  darwin s social and scientific status was far greater than wallace s  and it was unlikely that  without darwin  wallace s views on evolution would have been taken seriously  lyell and hooker s arrangement relegated wallace to the position of co discoverer  and he was not the social equal of darwin or the other prominent british natural scientists  however  the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated wallace with the more famous darwin  this  combined with darwin s  as well as hooker s and lyell s  advocacy on his behalf  would give wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community  the reaction to the reading was muted  with the president of the linnean society remarking in may      that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries  but  with darwin s publication of  on the origin of species  later in       its significance became apparent  when wallace returned to the uk  he met darwin  although some of wallace s iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test darwin s patience  they remained on friendly terms for the rest of darwin s life 

over the years  a few people have questioned this version of events  in the early     s  two books  one written by arnold brackman and another by john langdon brooks  even suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob wallace of his proper credit  but that darwin had actually stolen a key idea from wallace to finish his own theory  these claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing  research into shipping schedules has shown that  contrary to these accusations  wallace s letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in darwin s letter to lyell 

after the publication of darwin s  on the origin of species   wallace became one of its staunchest defenders on his return to england in       in one incident in      that particularly pleased darwin  wallace published the short paper  remarks on the rev  s  haughton s paper on the bee s cell  and on the origin of species  in order to rebut a paper by a professor of geology at the university of dublin that had sharply criticised darwin s comments in the  origin  on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection 

an even lengthier defence of darwin s work was  creation by law   a review wallace wrote in      for the  quarterly journal of science  of the book  the reign of law   which had been written by george campbell  the  th duke of argyll  as a refutation of natural selection  after an      meeting of the british science association  wallace wrote to darwin complaining that there were  no opponents left who know anything of natural history  so that there are none of the good discussions we used to have  

historians of science have noted that  while darwin considered the ideas in wallace s paper to be essentially the same as his own  there were differences  darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce  whereas wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions  leading populations in different locations to diverge  some historians  notably peter j  bowler  have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to darwin  wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection  however  malcolm kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and wallace was indeed discussing individual variations 

others have noted that another difference was that wallace appeared to have envisioned natural selection as a kind of feedback mechanism keeping species and varieties adapted to their environment  they point to a largely overlooked passage of wallace s famous      paper 

the cybernetician and anthropologist gregory bateson would observe in the     s that  though writing it only as an example  wallace had  probably said the most powerful thing that d been said in the   th century   bateson revisited the topic in his      book  mind and nature  a necessary unity   and other scholars have continued to explore the connection between natural selection and systems theory 

in       darwin wrote to wallace about a problem he was having understanding how some caterpillars could have evolved conspicuous colour schemes  darwin had come to believe that sexual selection  an agency to which wallace did not attribute the same importance as darwin did  explained many conspicuous animal colour schemes  however  darwin realised that this could not apply to caterpillars  wallace responded that he and henry bates had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste  and that he had been told by john jenner weir that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable   now  as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight   wallace wrote back to darwin that it seemed likely that the conspicuous colour scheme served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection  darwin was impressed by the idea  at a subsequent meeting of the entomological society  wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic  in       weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported wallace s idea  warning coloration was one of a number of contributions wallace made in the area of the evolution of animal coloration in general and the concept of protective coloration in particular  it was also part of a lifelong disagreement wallace had with darwin over the importance of sexual selection  in his      book  tropical nature and other essays   he wrote extensively on the coloration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases darwin had attributed to sexual selection  he revisited the topic at length in his      book  darwinism   in       he wrote a critical review in  nature  of his friend edward bagnall poulton s  the colours of animals  which supported darwin on sexual selection  attacking especially poulton s claims on the  aesthetic preferences of the insect world  

in       wallace wrote the book  darwinism   which explained and defended natural selection  in it  he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation  thus it might contribute to the development of new species  he suggested the following scenario  when two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point  each adapted to particular conditions  hybrid offspring would be less well adapted than either parent form and  at that point  natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids  furthermore  under such conditions  natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation  as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring  and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species  this idea came to be known as the wallace effect  later referred to as reinforcement  wallace had suggested to darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as       but had not worked it out to this level of detail  it continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today  with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity 

in       wallace published a paper   the origin of human races and the antiquity of man deduced from the theory of  natural selection    applying the theory to humankind  darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject  although thomas huxley had in  evidence as to man s place in nature   he explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes  unlike some other darwinists  including darwin himself  he did not  regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape   he saw the evolution of humans in two stages  achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain  and the  recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life  wallace was apparently the first evolutionist to recognize clearly that      with the emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes the human brain  bodily specialization itself might be said to be outmoded   for this paper he won darwin s praise 

shortly afterwards  wallace became a spiritualist  at about the same time  he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical  artistic  or musical genius  as well as metaphysical musings  and wit and humour  he eventually said that something in  the unseen universe of spirit  had interceded at least three times in history  the first was the creation of life from inorganic matter  the second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals  and the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind  he also believed that the raison d   tre of the universe was the development of the human spirit  these views greatly disturbed darwin  who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that sexual selection could easily explain apparently non adaptive mental phenomena  while some historians have concluded that wallace s belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism  other wallace scholars have disagreed  and some maintain that wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas  reaction to wallace s ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied  charles lyell endorsed wallace s views on human evolution rather than darwin s  wallace s belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late   th and early   th centuries  however  many  including huxley  hooker  and darwin himself  were critical of wallace  as the historian of science michael shermer has stated  wallace s views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging darwinian philosophy  which were that evolution was not teleological  purpose driven  and that it was not anthropocentric  human centred   much later in his life wallace returned to these themes  that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes  in a      magazine article entitled  the world of life   which he later expanded into a book of the same name  a work that shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from various religious traditions throughout the   th century 

in many accounts of the development of evolutionary theory  wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of darwin s own theory  in reality  wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from darwin s  and was considered by many  especially darwin  to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day  whose ideas could not be ignored  one historian of science has pointed out that  through both private correspondence and published works  darwin and wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other s ideas and theories over an extended period  wallace is the most cited naturalist in darwin s  descent of man   occasionally in strong disagreement 

both darwin and wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection  and some of the factors responsible for it  competition between species and geographical isolation  but wallace believed that evolution had a purpose   teleology   in maintaining species  fitness to their environment  whereas darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process  scientific discoveries since the   th century support darwin s viewpoint  by identifying several additional mechanisms and triggers 

wallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life  by the     s  evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles  in       wallace published the book  darwinism  as a response to the scientific critics of natural selection  of all wallace s books  it is the most cited by scholarly publications 

in       at the urging of many of his friends  including darwin  philip sclater  and alfred newton  wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals  he was unable to make much progress initially  in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time  he resumed the work in earnest in      after the publication of a number of new works on classification  extending the system developed by sclater for birds   which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution   to cover mammals  reptiles and insects as well  wallace created the basis for the zoogeographic regions still in use today  he discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region  these included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges  such as the one currently connecting north america and south america  and the effects of periods of increased glaciation  he provided maps that displayed factors  such as elevation of mountains  depths of oceans  and the character of regional vegetation  that affected the distribution of animals  he also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions  the text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location  the resulting two volume work   the geographical distribution of animals   was published in      and would serve as the definitive text on zoogeography for the next    years 

in this book wallace did not confine himself to the biogeography of living species  but also included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern animal species  for example  he discussed how fossil evidence showed that tapirs had originated in the northern hemisphere  migrating between north america and eurasia and then  much more recently  to south america after which the northern species became extinct  leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in south america and southeast asia  wallace was very aware of  and interested in  the mass extinction of megafauna in the late pleistocene  in  the geographical distribution of animals         he wrote   we live in a zoologically impoverished world  from which all the hugest  and fiercest  and strangest forms have recently disappeared   he added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions to have been glaciation  but by the time he wrote  world of life         he had come to believe those extinctions were  due to man s agency  

in       wallace published the book  island life  as a sequel to  the geographical distribution of animals   it surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands  wallace classified islands into three different types  oceanic islands  such as the galapagos and hawaiian islands  then known as the sandwich islands  formed in mid ocean and never part of any large continent  such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians  and their inhabitants  with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity  were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution  he divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently been part of a continent  like britain  or much less recently  like madagascar  and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna  he talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals  such as the lemurs of madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas  he extensively discussed how changes of climate  particularly periods of increased glaciation  may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands  and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages   island life  was considered a very important work at the time of its publication  it was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence 

wallace s extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world  in  tropical nature and other essays          he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion  especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall  noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate  he warned that the extensive clearing of rainforest for coffee cultivation in ceylon  sri lanka  and india would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their eventual impoverishment due to soil erosion  in  island life   wallace again mentioned deforestation and also the impact of invasive species  on the impact of european colonisation on the island of saint helena  he wrote 

wallace s comments on environment grew more strident later in his career  in  the world of life         he wrote 

wallace s      book  man s place in the universe  was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets  he concluded that the earth was the only planet in the solar system that could possibly support life  mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the liquid phase  more controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties  the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time  

his treatment of mars in this book was brief  and in       wallace returned to the subject with a book  is mars habitable   to criticise the claims made by percival lowell that there were martian canals built by intelligent beings  wallace did months of research  consulted various experts  and produced his own scientific analysis of the martian climate and atmospheric conditions  among other things  wallace pointed out that spectroscopic analysis had shown no signs of water vapour in the martian atmosphere  that lowell s analysis of mars s climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated the surface temperature  and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water  let alone a planet girding irrigation system  impossible  richard milner comments   it was the brilliant and eccentric evolutionist alfred russel wallace      who effectively debunked lowell s illusionary network of martian canals   wallace originally became interested in the topic because his anthropocentric philosophy inclined him to believe that man would likely be unique in the universe 

wallace also wrote poetic verse  an example being  a description of javita  from his book  travels on the amazon  

the poem begins 

 tis where the streams divide  to swell the floods

of the two mighty rivers of our globe 

where gushing brooklets in their narrow beds 

it continues then to describe the people of the village and their lives in detail  although it is not an idyllic description 

there is an indian village   all around 

the dark  eternal  boundless forest spreads

its varied foliage  stately palm trees rise

on every side  and numerous trees unknown

save by strange names uncouth to english ears 

here i dwelt awhile the one white man

among perhaps two hundred living souls 

they pass a peaceful and contented life 

the poem is a lyrical description of the life of a tribe he was living with along the amazon river  while it has echoes of tennyson in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly romantic  serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between the lives of the people living here and those in england  the poem is a comment on savagery and greed  making the point that some in england were more  savage  than those on the amazon  either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty 

wallace concludes 

i d be an indian here  and live content

to fish  and hunt  and paddle my canoe 

and see my children grow  like young wild fawns 

in health of body and in peace of mind 

rich without wealth  and happy without gold  

the poem is referenced and partially recited in the bbc television series  the ascent of man  

in a letter to his brother in law in       wallace wrote 

wallace was an enthusiast of phrenology  early in his career  he experimented with hypnosis  then known as mesmerism  he used some of his students in leicester as subjects  with considerable success  when he began his experiments with mesmerism  the topic was very controversial and early experimenters  such as john elliotson  had been harshly criticised by the medical and scientific establishment  wallace drew a connection between his experiences with mesmerism and his later investigations into spiritualism  in       he wrote 

wallace began investigating spiritualism in the summer of       possibly at the urging of his older sister fanny sims  who had been involved with it for some time  after reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at s  ances  he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality  for the rest of his life  he remained convinced that at least some s  ance phenomena were genuine  no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced  historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism  it has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier  when his first fianc  e broke their engagement  contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism  other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead wallace s desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena  both material and non material  of the natural world and of human society 

spiritualism appealed to many educated victorians who no longer found traditional religious doctrine  such as that of the church of england  acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from   th century science  however  several scholars who have researched wallace s views in depth have emphasised that  for him  spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief  among other prominent   th century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer robert owen  who was one of wallace s early idols  the physicists william crookes and lord rayleigh  the mathematician augustus de morgan  and the scottish publisher robert chambers 

during the     s the stage magician john nevil maskelyne exposed the trickery of the davenport brothers  wallace was unable to accept that he had replicated their feats utilizing natural methods  and stated that maskelyne possessed supernatural powers  however  in one of his writings wallace dismissed maskelyne  referring to a lecture exposing his tricks 

in       wallace visited the spirit photographer frederick hudson  a photograph of him with his deceased mother was produced and wallace declared the photograph genuine  declaring  even if he had by some means obtained possession of all the photographs ever taken of my mother  they would not have been of the slightest use to him in the manufacture of these pictures  i see no escape from the conclusion that some spiritual being  acquainted with my mother s various aspects during life  produced these recognisable impressions on the plate   however  hudson s photographs had previously been exposed as fraudulent in      

wallace s very public advocacy of spiritualism and his repeated defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud in the     s damaged his scientific reputation  in      wallace published the evidence he believed proved his position in his book  on miracles and modern spiritualism  which is a compilation of essays he wrote over a period of time  in his chapter entitled  modern spiritualism  evidence of men of science   wallace refers to  three men of the highest eminence in their respective departments  who were professor de morgan  professor hare and judge edmonds who all investigated spiritualist phenomena  however  wallace himself is only quoting their results and was not present at any of their investigations  his vehement defence of spiritualism strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as henry bates  thomas huxley  and even darwin  who felt he was overly credulous  evidence of this can be seen in wallace s letters dated    november and   december       to thomas huxley asking him if he would be interested in getting involved in scientific spiritualist investigations which huxley  politely but emphatically  declined on the basis that he had neither the time nor the inclination  others  such as the physiologist william benjamin carpenter and zoologist e  ray lankester became openly and publicly hostile to wallace over the issue  wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism  notably william crookes  were subject to much criticism from the press  with  the lancet  as the leading english medical journal of the time being particularly harsh  the controversy affected the public perception of wallace s work for the rest of his career  when  in       darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to wallace  joseph hooker responded 

hooker eventually relented and agreed to support the pension request 

in       a flat earth proponent named john hampden offered a       wager  equivalent to about    in present day terms  in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river  canal  or lake  wallace  intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time  designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six mile      km  stretch of canal  both objects were at the same height above the water  and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well  when seen through the telescope  one object appeared higher than the other  showing the curvature of the earth 

the judge for the wager  the editor of  field  magazine  declared wallace the winner  but hampden refused to accept the result  he sued wallace and launched a campaign  which persisted for several years  of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief  wallace won multiple libel suits against hampden  but the resulting litigation cost wallace more than the amount of the wager and the controversy frustrated him for years 

in the early     s  wallace was drawn into the debate over mandatory smallpox vaccination  wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty  but  after studying some of the statistics provided by anti vaccination activists  he began to question the efficacy of vaccination  at the time  the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted  moreover  no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked  when wallace did some research  he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable  in a few cases completely phony  statistics to support their arguments  always suspicious of authority  wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination  and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were  in fact  due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation 

another factor in wallace s thinking was his belief that  because of the action of natural selection  organisms were in a state of balance with their environment  and that everything in nature  even disease causing organisms  served a useful purpose in the natural order of things  he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results  wallace and other anti vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination  which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner  could be dangerous 

in       wallace gave evidence before a royal commission investigating the controversy  when the commission examined the material he had submitted to support his testimony  they found errors  including some questionable statistics   the lancet  averred that wallace and the other anti vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics  ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position  the commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory  though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety  and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe  years later  in       wallace wrote a pamphlet   vaccination a delusion  its penal enforcement a crime   attacking the commission s findings  it  in turn  was attacked by  the lancet   which stated that it contained many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission 

as a result of his writing  at the time of his death wallace had been for many years a well known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist  he was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics  he received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours  such the royal society s royal medal and darwin medal in      and      respectively  and the order of merit in       above all  his role as the co discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure 

he was undoubtedly one of the greatest natural history explorers of the   th century  despite this  his fame faded quickly after his death  for a long time  he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science  a number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention  including his modesty  his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation  and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas 

recently  he has become a less obscure figure with the publication of several book length biographies on him  as well as anthologies of his writings  in      a literary critic for  new yorker  magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since       there has also been a web page created that is dedicated to wallace scholarship 
in a      book  the environmentalist tim flannery claimed that wallace was  the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival   and suggested that wallace s understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking 

the natural history museum  london  co ordinated commemorative events for the wallace centenary worldwide in the  wallace     project in       on    january  his portrait was unveiled in the main hall of the museum by bill bailey  a fervent admirer  on the bbc two programme  bill bailey s jungle hero   first broadcast on    april       bailey revealed how wallace cracked evolution by revisiting places where wallace discovered exotic species  episode one featured orangutans and flying frogs in bailey s journey through borneo  episode two featured birds of paradise  on   november       the    th anniversary of wallace s death  sir david attenborough unveiled a statue of wallace at the museum  the statue was donated by the a  r  wallace memorial fund  and was sculpted by anthony smith  it depicts wallace as a young man  collecting in the jungle  november      also marked the debut of  the animated life of a  r  wallace   a paper puppet animation film dedicated to wallace s centennial 


wallace was a prolific author  in       a historian of science published a quantitative analysis of wallace s publications  he found that wallace had published    full length books and at least     shorter pieces      of which were scientific papers      of them published in  nature    he further broke down the     short pieces by their primary subjects as follows      were on biogeography and natural history      were on evolutionary theory      were social commentary      were on anthropology  and    were on spiritualism and phrenology  an online bibliography of wallace s writings has more than     entries 



a more comprehensive list of wallace s publications that are available online  as well as a full bibliography of all of wallace s writings  has been compiled by the historian charles h  smith at the alfred russel wallace page 








australian labor party

the australian labor party  alp  known as labor  historically spelt labour  is a major centre left political party in australia  the party has been in opposition at the federal level since the      election  bill shorten has been the party s federal parliamentary leader since    october       the party is a federal party with branches in each state and territory  labor is in government in the states of victoria  queensland  western australia  and in both the australian capital territory and northern territory  the party competes against the liberal national coalition for political office at the federal and state  and sometimes local  levels  it is the oldest political party in australia  

labor s constitution has long stated   the australian labor party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry  production  distribution and exchange  to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti social features in these fields   this  socialist objective  was introduced in       but was later qualified by two further objectives   maintenance of and support for a competitive non monopolistic private sector  and  the right to own private property   labor governments have not attempted the  democratic socialisation  of any industry since the     s  when the chifley government failed to nationalise the private banks  and in fact have privatised several industries such as aviation and banking  labor s current national platform describes the party as  a modern social democratic party  

the alp was not founded as a federal party until after the first sitting of the australian parliament in       nevertheless  it is regarded as descended from labour parties founded in the various australian colonies by the emerging labour movement in australia  formally beginning in       labor is thus the country s oldest political party  colonial labour parties contested seats from       and federal seats following federation at the      federal election  the alp formed the world s first labour party government  as well as the world s first social democratic government at a national level  labor was the first party in australia to win a majority in either house of the australian parliament  at the      federal election  the australian labor party at both a federal and state colony level predates  among others  both the british labour party and the new zealand labour party in party formation  government  and policy implementation  internationally  the alp is a member of the progressive alliance network of social democratic parties  having previously been a member of the socialist international 

in standard australian english  the word  labour  is spelled with a   however  the political party uses the spelling  labor   without a   there was originally no standardised spelling of the party s name  with  labor  and  labour  both in common usage  according to ross mcmullin  who wrote an official history of the labor party  the title page of the proceedings of federal conference used the spelling  labor  in        labour  in      and       and then  labor  from      onwards  in       james catts put forward a motion at federal conference that  the name of the party be the australian labour party   which was carried by    votes to two  a separate motion recommending state branches to adopt the name was defeated  there was no uniformity of party names until       when federal conference resolved that state branches should adopt the name  australian labor party      now spelled without a   each state branch had previously used a different name  due to their different origins 

despite the alp officially adopting the spelling without a   it took decades for the official spelling to achieve widespread acceptance  in       labor mp ted johnson complained in the parliament of western australia that both  hansard  and the daily newspapers were still using the spelling  labour   as late as the     s  historian finlay crisp used the spelling  labour  in academic works about the party  mcmullin has observed that  the way the spelling of  labor party  was consolidated had more to do with the chap who ended up being in charge of printing the federal conference report than any other reason   some sources have attributed the official decision to use  labor  to king o malley  who was born in the united states and was reputedly an advocate of spelling reform  the spelling without a is the standard form in american english  it has been suggested that the adoption of the spelling without a  signified one of the alp s earliest attempts at modernisation   and served the purpose of differentiating the party from the australian labour movement as a whole and distinguishing it from other british empire labour parties  the decision to include the word  australian  in the party s name     rather than just  labour party  as in the united kingdom     has been attributed to  the greater importance of nationalism for the founders of the colonial parties  

the australian labor party has its origins in the labour parties founded in the     s in the australian colonies prior to federation  labor tradition ascribes the founding of queensland labour to a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a ghost gum tree  the  tree of knowledge   in barcaldine  queensland in       the balmain  new south wales branch of the party claims to be the oldest in australia  labour as a parliamentary party dates from      in new south wales and south australia       in queensland  and later in the other colonies 

the first election contested by labour candidates was the      new south wales election  when labour candidates  then called the labor electoral league of new south wales  won    of     seats  the major parties were the protectionist and free trade parties and labour held the balance of power  it offered parliamentary support in exchange for policy concessions  the united labor party  ulp  of south australia was founded in       and three candidates were that year elected to the south australian legislative council  the first successful south australian house of assembly candidate was john mcpherson at the      east adelaide by election  richard hooper however was elected as an independent labor candidate at the      wallaroo by election  while he was the first  labor  member of the house of assembly he was not a member of the newly formed ulp 

at the      south australian elections the ulp was immediately elevated to balance of power status with    of    lower house seats  the liberal government of charles kingston was formed with the support of the ulp  ousting the conservative government of john downer  so successful  less than a decade later at the      election  thomas price formed the world s first stable labor government  john verran led labor to form the state s first of many majority governments at the      election 

in       anderson dawson formed a minority labour government in queensland  the first in the world  which lasted one week while the conservatives regrouped after a split 

the colonial labour parties and the trade unions were mixed in their support for the federation of australia  some labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution  claiming that the senate as proposed was too powerful  similar to the anti reformist colonial upper houses and the british house of lords  they feared that federation would further entrench the power of the conservative forces  the first labour leader and prime minister  chris watson  however  was a supporter of federation 

historian celia hamilton  examining new south wales  argues for the central role of irish catholics  before       they opposed henry parkes  the main liberal leader  and of free trade  seeing them both as the ideals of protestant englishmen who represented landholding and large business interests  in the strike of      the leading catholic  sydney s archbishop patrick francis moran was sympathetic toward unions  but catholic newspapers were negative  after       says hamilton  irish catholics were drawn to the labour party because its stress on equality and social welfare fitted with their status as manual labourers and small farmers  in the      elections labour gained in the more catholic areas and the representation of catholics increased in labour s parliamentary ranks 

the federal parliament in      was contested by each state labour party  in total  they won    of the    seats in the house of representatives  collectively holding the balance of power  and the labour members now met as the federal parliamentary labour party  informally known as the caucus  on   may      at parliament house  melbourne  the meeting place of the first federal parliament  the caucus decided to support the incumbent protectionist party in minority government  while the free trade party formed the opposition  it was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level  labour under chris watson doubled its vote at the      federal election and continued to hold the balance of power  in april       however  watson and alfred deakin fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the conciliation and arbitration bill to cover state public servants  the fallout causing deakin to resign  free trade leader george reid declined to take office  which saw watson become the first labour prime minister of australia  and the world s first labour head of government at a national level  anderson dawson had led a short lived labour government in queensland in december        though his was a minority government that lasted only four months  he was aged only     and is still the youngest prime minister in australia s history 

george reid of the free trade party adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along labour vs non labour lines     prior to the      federal election  he renamed his free trade party to the anti socialist party  reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti socialist  with the protectionist party in the middle  this attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the westminster tradition and regarded a two party system as very much the norm 

though watson further strengthened labour s position in       he stepped down from the leadership the following year  to be succeeded by andrew fisher who formed a minority government lasting seven months from late      to mid       at the      election  fisher led labor to victory  forming australia s first elected federal majority government  australia s first elected senate majority  the world s first labour party majority government at a national level  and after the      chris watson minority government the world s second labour party government at a national level  it was the first time a labour party had controlled any house of a legislature  and the first time the party controlled both houses of a bicameral legislature  the state branches were also successful  except in victoria  where the strength of deakinite liberalism inhibited the party s growth  the state branches formed their first majority governments in new south wales and south australia in       western australia in       queensland in      and tasmania in       such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years 

analysis of the early nsw labor caucus reveals  a band of unhappy amateurs   made up of blue collar workers  a squatter  a doctor  and even a mine owner  indicating that the idea that only the socialist working class formed labor is untrue  in addition  many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies     in the first grouping of state mps     of the    were free traders 

in the aftermath of world war i and the russian revolution of       support for socialism grew in trade union ranks  and at the      all australian trades union congress a resolution was passed calling for  the socialisation of industry  production  distribution and exchange   the      labor party national conference adopted a similarly worded  socialist objective   which remained official policy for many years  the resolution was immediately qualified  however  by the  blackburn amendment   which said that  socialisation  was desirable only when was necessary to  eliminate exploitation and other anti social features   in practice the socialist objective was a dead letter  only once has a federal labor government attempted to nationalise any industry  ben chifley s bank nationalisation of        and that was held by the high court to be unconstitutional  the commitment to nationalisation was dropped by gough whitlam  and bob hawke s government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and privatisation of state enterprises such as qantas airways and the commonwealth bank 

the labor party is commonly described as a social democratic party  and its constitution stipulates that it is a democratic socialist party  the party was created by  and has always been influenced by  the trade unions  and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement  thus at the first federal election      labor s platform called for a white australia policy  a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes  labor has at various times supported high tariffs and low tariffs  conscription and pacifism  white australia and multiculturalism  nationalisation and privatisation  isolationism and internationalism 

historically  labor and its affiliated unions were strong defenders of the white australia policy  which banned all non european migration to australia  this policy was partly motivated by   th century theories about  racial purity  and by fears of economic competition from low wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of australians and all major political parties  in practice the party opposed all migration  on the grounds that immigrants competed with australian workers and drove down wages  until after world war ii  when the chifley government launched a major immigration program  the party s opposition to non european immigration did not change until after the retirement of arthur calwell as leader in       subsequently  labor has become an advocate of multiculturalism  although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels 

the curtin and chifley governments governed australia through the latter half of the second world war and initial stages of transition to peace  labor leader john curtin became prime minister in october      when two independents crossed the floor of parliament  labor  led by curtin  then led australia through the years of the pacific war  in december       curtin announced that  australia looks to america  free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the united kingdom   thus helping to establish the australian american alliance  later formalised as anzus by the menzies government   remembered as a strong war time leader and for a landslide win at the      election  curtin died in office just prior to the end of the war and was succeeded by ben chifley  chifley labor won the      election and oversaw australia s initial transition to a peacetime economy  labor was defeated at the      election  at the conference of the new south wales labor party in june       chifley sought to define the labour movement as having 

to a large extent  chifley saw centralisation of the economy as the means to achieve such ambitions  with an increasingly uncertain economic outlook  after his attempt to nationalise the banks and a strike by the communist dominated miners  federation  chifley lost office in      to robert menzies  liberal national coalition  labor commenced a    year period in opposition 

various ideological beliefs were factionalised under reforms to the alp under gough whitlam  resulting in what is now known as the socialist left who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy and more socially progressive ideals  and labor right  the now dominant faction that tends to be more economically liberal and focus to a lesser extent on social issues  the whitlam labor government  marking a break with labor s socialist tradition  pursued social democratic policies rather than democratic socialist policies  whitlam  in contrast to earlier labor leaders  also cut tariffs by    percent  whitlam led the federal labor party back to office at the      and      elections  and passed a large amount of legislation  the whitlam government lost office following the      australian constitutional crisis and dismissal by governor general sir john kerr after the coalition blocked supply in the senate after a series of political scandals  and was defeated at the      election  whitlam remains the only prime minister to have his commission terminated in that manner 

bob hawke led labor back to office at the      election and the hawke   keating government remained in power until defeated by john howard at the      election 

kim beazley led the party to the      election  winning    percent of the two party preferred vote but falling short on seats  and lost ground at the      election  mark latham led labor to the      election but lost further ground  beazley replaced latham in       beazley in turn was challenged by kevin rudd who went on to defeat john howard at the      election with      percent of the two party vote  the rudd government ended prior to the      election with the replacement of rudd as leader of the party by deputy leader julia gillard  the gillard government was commissioned to govern in a hung parliament following the      election with a one seat parliamentary majority and       percent of the two party vote 

between the      federal election and the      western australian state election  labor was in government nationally  as well as in all eight state and territory legislatures  this was the first time any single party or any coalition had achieved this since the act and the nt gained self government  labor narrowly lost government in western australia at the      state election and victoria at the      state election  these losses were further compounded by landslide defeats in new south wales in       queensland in       the northern territory in       federally in      and tasmania in       labor secured a good result in the australian capital territory in      and  despite losing its majority  the party retained government in south australia in      

however  most of these reversals proved only temporary with labor returning to government in victoria in      and in queensland in      after spending only one term in opposition in both states  furthermore  after winning the      fisher by election by nine votes from a     percent swing  the labor government in south australia went from minority to majority government  labor won landslide victories in the      northern territory election the      western australian election and the      victorian state election  however lost the      south australian state election after    years in government 

the policy of the australian labor party is contained in its national platform  which is approved by delegates to labor s national conference  held every three years  according to the labor party s website   the platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation  spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees  local branches  unions  state and territory governments  and individual party members  the platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal labor government  

the platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future labor government would follow  but does not commit the party to specific policies  it maintains that  labor s traditional values will remain a constant on which all australians can rely   while making it clear that labor is fully committed to a market economy  it says that   labor believes in a strong role for national government      the one institution all australians truly own and control through our right to vote   labor  will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands  or located only in privileged communities  the benefits must be shared by all australians and all our regions   the platform and labor  believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect  and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential   for labor   government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by  ensuring equal opportunity  removing unjustifiable discrimination  and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth  income and status   further sections of the platform stress labor s support for equality and human rights  labour rights and democracy 

in practice  the platform provides only general policy guidelines to labor s federal  state and territory parliamentary leaderships  the policy labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the cabinet  if the party is in office  or the shadow cabinet  if it is in opposition   in consultation with key interest groups within the party  and is contained in the parliamentary leader s policy speech delivered during the election campaign  when labor is in office  the policies it implements are determined by the cabinet  subject to the platform  generally  it is accepted that while the platform binds labor governments  how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus  it is now rare for the platform to conflict with government policy  as the content of the platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the party s parliamentary leadership as well as the factions  however  where there is a direct contradiction with the platform  labor governments have sought to change the platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy  for example  privatisation legislation under the hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the platform 

the australian labor party national executive is the chief administrative authority of the australian labor party  subject only to labor s national conference  the executive is responsible for organising the triennial national conference  carrying out the decisions of national conference  interpreting the national constitution  the national platform and decisions of national conference  and directing federal members 

the party holds a national conference every three years  which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches  many coming from affiliated trade unions  although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the national conference   the national conference decides the party s platform  elects the national executive  and appoints office bearers such as the national secretary  who also serves as national campaign director during elections  the current national secretary is noah carroll  the most recent national conference was the   th conference held from    to    july      

the head office of the alp  the national secretariat  is managed by the national secretary  it plays a dual role of administration and a national campaign strategy  it acts as a permanent secretariat to the national executive by managing and assisting in all administrative affairs of the party  as the national secretary also serves as national campaign director during elections  it is also responsible for the national campaign strategy and organisation 

the elected members of the labor party in both houses of the national parliament meet as the federal parliamentary labor party  also known as the caucus  besides discussing parliamentary business and tactics  the caucus also is involved in the election of the federal parliamentary leaders  until      the parliamentary leaders were elected by the caucus from among its members  the leader has historically been a member of the house of representatives  since october       a ballot of both the caucus and by the labor party s rank and file members determined the party leader and the deputy leader  when the labor party is in government  the party leader is the prime minister and the deputy leader is the deputy prime minister  if a labor prime minister resigns or dies in office  the deputy leader acts as prime minister and party leader until a successor is elected  members of the ministry are also chosen by caucus  though the leader may allocate portfolios to the ministers 

the australian labor party is a federal party  consisting of eight branches from each state and territory  while the national executive is responsible for national campaign strategy  each state and territory are an autonomous branch and are responsible for campaigning in their own jurisdictions for federal  state and local elections  state and territory branches consist of both individual members and affiliated trade unions  who between them decide the party s policies  elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office 

members join a state branch and pay a membership fee  which is graduated according to income  the majority of trade unions in australia are affiliated to the party at a state level  union affiliation is direct and not through the australian council of trade unions  affiliated unions pay an affiliation fee based on the size of their membership  union affiliation fees make up a large part of the party s income  another source of funds for the party are political donations and public funding 

members are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year  although there are differences in the rules from state to state  in practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings  many members are only active during election campaigns 

the members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences  usually held annually  although more frequent conferences are often held   these conferences decide policy  and elect state or territory executives  a state or territory president  an honorary position usually held for a one year term   and a state or territory secretary  a full time professional position   however  act labor directly elects its president  the larger branches also have full time assistant secretaries and organisers  in the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state  however under recent national reforms at least     of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches 

in some states it also contests local government elections or endorses local candidates  in others it does not  preferring to allow its members to run as non endorsed candidates  the process of choosing candidates is called preselection  candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories  in some they are chosen by ballots of all party members  in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference  in still others by a combination of these two 

country labor is a subsection of the alp  and is used as a designation by candidates contesting elections in rural areas  it functions as a sort of ginger group within the party  and is somewhat analogous to its youth wing  the country labor party is registered as a separate party in new south wales and is also registered with the australian electoral commission  aec  for federal elections  it does not have the same status in other states  and consequently that designation cannot be used on the ballot paper 

the creation of a separation designation for rural candidates was first suggested at the june      alp state conference in new south wales  in may       following labor s success at the      benalla by election in victoria  kim beazley announced that the alp intended to register a separate  country labor party  with the aec  this occurred in october       the country labor designation is most frequently used in new south wales  according to the alp s financial statements for the           financial year  nsw country labor had around       members  around    percent of the party total   but almost no assets  it recorded a severe funding shortfall at the      nsw state election  and had to rely on a       million loan from the party proper to remain solvent  it had been initially assumed that the party proper could provide the money from its own resources  but the nsw electoral commission ruled that this was impermissible because the parties were registered separately  instead the party proper had to loan country labor the required funds at a commercial interest rate 

australian young labor is the youth wing of the australian labor party  where all members under age    are automatically members  it is the peak youth body within the alp  former presidents of ayl have included former nsw premier bob carr  federal manager of opposition business tony burke  former special minister of state senator john faulkner  former australian workers union national secretary and current member for maribyrnong and federal labor leader bill shorten as well as dozens of state ministers and mps  the current national president is jack boyd  from the new south wales right  nsw centre unity  

the australian labor party is beginning to formally recognise single interest groups within the party  the national platform currently encourages state branches to formally establish these groups known as policy action caucuses  examples of such groups include the labor environment action network  rainbow labor  and labor for refugees  the tasmanian branch of the australian labor party recently gave these groups voting and speaking rights at their state conference 

the labor party has always had a left wing and a right wing  but since the     s it has been organised into formal factions  to which party members may belong and often pay an additional membership fee  the two largest factions are labor unity  national right  and the socialist left  national left   labor unity generally supports free market policies and the us alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues  the socialist left  although it seldom openly espouses socialism  favours more state intervention in the economy  is generally less enthusiastic about the us alliance and is often more liberal on social issues  the national factions are themselves divided into sub factions  primarily state based such as centre unity in new south wales and labor forum in queensland 

some trade unions are affiliated with the labor party and are also factionally aligned  the largest unions supporting the right faction are the australian workers  union  awu   the shop  distributive and allied employees  association  sda   the national union of workers  nuw  and the transport workers union  twu   important unions supporting the left include the australian manufacturing workers union  amwu   united voice  the construction  forestry  maritime  mining and energy union  cfmmeu  and the community and public sector union  cpsu   these affiliations are seldom unconditional or permanent  in some cases different union branches may have different factional alignments  on other issues  such as opposition to the howard government s industrial relations policy  called workchoices  most unions were in agreement 

preselections are usually conducted along factional lines  although sometimes a non factional candidate will be given preferential treatment  this happened with cheryl kernot in      and again with peter garrett in        deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place  preselections  particularly for safe labor seats  can sometimes be strongly contested  a particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of branch stacking  signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in preselection ballots   personation  multiple voting and  on occasions  fraudulent electoral enrolment  trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections  but party rules changes have stamped out this practice  preselection results are sometimes challenged  and the national executive is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes 

the current leader of the alp is bill shorten since    october       and the deputy leader is tanya plibersek  in accordance with party rules  shorten s leadership was reaffirmed by party members on   july       following the      federal election

dodo  alice s adventures in wonderland 

the dodo is a fictional character appearing in chapters   and   of the book  alice s adventures in wonderland  by lewis carroll  charles lutwidge dodgson   the dodo is a caricature of the author  a popular but unsubstantiated belief is that dodgson chose the particular animal to represent himself because of his stammer  and thus would accidentally introduce himself as  do do dodgson  

historically  the dodo was a non flying bird that lived on the island of mauritius  east of madagascar in the indian ocean  it became extinct in the mid   th century during the colonisation of the island by the dutch 

in this passage lewis carroll incorporated references to the original boating expedition of   july      during which alice s adventures were first told  with alice as herself  and the others represented by birds  the lory was lorina liddell  the eaglet was edith liddell  the dodo was dodgson  and the duck was rev  robinson duckworth  in order to get dry after a swim  the dodo proposes that everyone run a caucus race     where the participants run in patterns of any shape  starting and leaving off whenever they like  so that everyone wins  at the end of the race  alice distributes comfits from her pocket to all as prizes  however this leaves no prize for herself  the dodo inquires what else she has in her pocket  as she has only a thimble  the dodo requests it from her and then awards it to alice as her prize  the caucus race as depicted by carroll is a satire on the political caucus system  mocking its lack of clarity and decisiveness 

in the disney film  the dodo plays a much greater role in the story  he is merged with the character of pat the gardener  which leads to him sometimes being nicknamed pat the dodo  but this name is never mentioned in the film  the dodo is also the leader of the caucus race  a role originally held by the mouse  he has the appearance and personality of a sea captain  the dodo is voiced by bill thompson and animated by milt kahl 

dodo is first seen as alice is floating on the sea in a bottle  dodo is seen singing  but when alice asks him for help  he does not notice her  on shore  dodo is seen on a rock  organizing a caucus race  this race involves running around until one gets dry  but the attempts are hampered by incoming waves 
dodo is later summoned by the white rabbit  when the rabbit believes a monster  actually alice having magically grown to a giant size  is inside his home  dodo brings bill the lizard  and attempts to get him to go down the chimney  bill refuses at first  but dodo is able to convince him otherwise  however  the soot causes alice to sneeze  sending bill high up into the sky  dodo then decides to burn the house down  much to the chagrin of the white rabbit  he begins gathering wood  such as the furniture  for this purpose  however  alice is soon able to return to a smaller size and exit the house 

the white rabbit soon leaves  while dodo asks for matches  not realizing that the situation has been resolved  he then asks alice for a match  but when she doesn t have any  dodo complains about the lack of cooperation and uses his pipe to light the fire 

the dodo later appears briefly at the end of the film  conducting another caucus race 
in tim burton s adaptation of alice in wonderland  the dodo s appearance retains the subtle apparent nature from john tenniel s illustration  he bears a down of brilliant blue and wears a blue coat and white spats along with glasses and a cane  he is one of alice s good willed advisers  taking first note of her abilities as the true alice  he is also one of the oldest inhabitants  his name is uilleam  and he is portrayed by michael gough  he goes with the white rabbit  tweedledee and tweedledum  and dormouse to take alice to caterpillar to decide whether alice is the real one  he is later captured by the red queen s forces  when alice came to the red queen s castle  he was seen at the red queen s castle yard as a caddy for the queen s croquet game  after the red queen orders the release of the jubjub bird  he is then seen briefly running from it when the tweedles went to hide from it and escaped 

his name may be based on a lecture on william the conqueror from chapter three of the original novel  the character is voiced by michael gough in his final feature film role before his death in       gough came out of retirement to appear in the film but the character only speaks three lines  so gough managed to record in one day  unlike most of the other creatures  uilleam doesn t appear in the end battle scene 

in the anime and manga series  pandora hearts  dodo is the chain of rufus barma one of the four dukedoms

posthumously  he became known as  alcibiades  

albert was born in ansbach and  losing his father casimir in       he came under the guardianship of his uncle george  margrave of brandenburg ansbach  a strong adherent of protestantism 
in       he received bayreuth as his share of the family lands  but as the chief town of his principality was kulmbach  he is sometimes referred to as the margrave of brandenburg kulmbach 
his restless and turbulent nature marked him out for a military career  and having collected a small band of soldiers  he assisted emperor charles v in his war with france in      

the peace of cr  py in september      deprived him of this employment  but he won a considerable reputation  and when charles was preparing to attack the schmalkaldic league  he took pains to win albert s assistance 

sharing in the attack on the electorate of saxony  albert was taken prisoner at rochlitz in march      by elector john frederick of saxony  but was released as a result of the emperor s victory at the battle of m  hlberg in the succeeding april 

he then followed the fortunes of his friend elector maurice of saxony  deserted charles  and joined the league which proposed to overthrow the emperor by an alliance with king henry ii of france 

he took part in the subsequent campaign  but when the peace of passau was signed in august      he separated himself from his allies and began a crusade of plunder in franconia  which led to the second margrave war 

having extorted a large sum of money from the citizens of nuremberg  he quarrelled with his supporter  the french king  and offered his services to the emperor 
charles  anxious to secure such a famous fighter  gladly assented to albert s demands and gave the imperial sanction to his possession of the lands taken from the bishops of w  rzburg and bamberg  and his conspicuous bravery was of great value to the emperor on the retreat from the siege of metz in january      

when charles left germany a few weeks later  albert renewed his depredations in franconia  these soon became so serious that a league was formed to crush him  and maurice of saxony led an army against his former comrade 
the rival forces met at sievershausen on   july       and after a combat of unusual ferocity albert was put to flight  henry  duke of brunswick wolfenb  ttel  then took command of the troops of the league  and after albert had been placed under the imperial ban in december      he was defeated by duke henry  and compelled to flee to france 
he there entered the service of henry ii of france and had undertaken a campaign to regain his lands when he died at pforzheim on   january      

he is defined by thomas carlyle as  a failure of a fritz   with  features  of a frederick the great in him   but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors  and never came to anything  full of fire  too much of it wildfire  not in the least like an alcibiades except in the change of fortune he underwent   he had early two children  frederick and anna  he was to be buried heilsbronn m  nster 


 




albert the bear

albert the bear                  november       was the first margrave of brandenburg  as albert  i  from      to his death and was briefly duke of saxony between      and       

albert was the only son of otto  count of ballenstedt  and eilika  daughter of magnus billung  duke of saxony  he inherited the valuable estates in northern saxony of his father in       and on his mother s death  in       succeeded to one half of the lands of the house of billung  albert was a loyal vassal of his relation  lothar i  duke of saxony  from whom  about       he received the margraviate of lusatia  to the east  after lothar became king of the germans  he accompanied him on a disastrous expedition to bohemia against the upstart  sob  slav i  duke of bohemia in      at the battle of kulm  where he suffered a short imprisonment 

albert s entanglements in saxony stemmed from his desire to expand his inherited estates there  after the death of his brother in law  henry ii  margrave of the nordmark  who controlled a small area on the elbe called the saxon northern march  in       albert  disappointed at not receiving this fief himself  attacked udo v  count of stade  the heir  and was consequently deprived of lusatia by lothar  udo  however  was said to have been assassinated by servants of albert on    march      near aschersleben  in spite of this  he went to italy in      in the train of the king  and his services there were rewarded in      by the investiture of the northern march  which was again without a ruler 

in      conrad iii  the hohenstaufen king of the germans  deprived albert s cousin and nemesis  henry the proud of his saxon duchy  which was awarded to albert if he could take it  after some initial success in his efforts to take possession  albert was driven from saxony  and also from his northern march by a combined force of henry and jaxa of k  penick  and compelled to take refuge in south germany  when peace was made with henry in       albert renounced the saxon duchy and received the counties of weimar and orlam  nde  it was possibly at this time that albert was made archchamberlain of the empire  an office which afterwards gave the margraves of brandenburg the rights of a prince elector 

once he was firmly established in the northern march  albert s covetous eye lay also on the thinly populated lands to the north and east  for three years he was occupied in campaigns against the slavic wends  who as pagans were considered fair game  and whose subjugation to christianity was the aim of the wendish crusade of      in which albert took part  albert was a part of the army that besieged demmin  and at the end of the war  recovered havelberg  which had been lost since      diplomatic measures were more successful  and by an arrangement made with the last of the wendish princes of brandenburg  pribislav of the hevelli  albert secured this district when the prince died in       taking the title  margrave in brandenburg   he pressed the  crusade  against the wends  extended the area of his mark  encouraged german migration  established bishoprics under his protection  and so became the founder of the margraviate of brandenburg in       which his heirs     the house of ascania     held until the line died out in      

in      a feud with henry s son  henry the lion  duke of saxony  was interrupted by a pilgrimage to the holy land  on his return in       he  with the consent of his sons  siegfried not being mentioned  donated land to the knights of saint john in memory of his wife  sofia  at werben at the elbe  in      albert accompanied emperor frederick barbarossa to italy  where he distinguished himself at the storming of milan 

in      albert joined a league of princes formed against henry the lion  and peace being made in       albert divided his territories among his six sons  he died on    november       possibly in stendal  and was buried at ballenstedt 

albert s personal qualities won for him the cognomen of  the bear    not from his looks or qualities  for he was a tall handsome man  but from the cognisance on his shield  an able man  had a quick eye as well as a strong hand  and could pick what way was straightest among crooked things  was the shining figure and the great man of the north in his day  got much in the north and kept it  got brandenburg for one there  a conspicuous country ever since   says carlyle  who called albert  a restless  much managing  wide warring man   he is also called by later writers  the handsome  

albert was married in      to sophie of winzenburg  died    march       and they had the following children 


 




albert of brandenburg

cardinal albert of brandenburg       june        september       was elector and archbishop of mainz from      to       and archbishop of magdeburg from      to      

his involvement in the sale of indulgences to fund his debt was to prompt martin luther  a friar in his diocese to complain about the abuse  his subsequent failure to meet with and take seriously the complaints from luther  his failure to inform rome of the seriousness of the situation and finally rome s refusal to act properly faced with the situation  forced luther to more serious action  these failures to respond adequately make him notable for his failure to prevent the reformation 

born in k  lln on the spree  albert was the younger son of john cicero  elector of brandenburg and of margaret of thuringia 

after their father s funeral  albert and his older brother joachim i nestor became margraves of brandenburg in       but only his older brother held the title of an elector of brandenburg  having studied at the university of frankfurt  oder   albert entered the ecclesiastical profession  and in      became archbishop of magdeburg at the age of    and administrator of the diocese of halberstadt 

in      he obtained the electorate of mainz  and in       at the age of     was made a cardinal  to pay for the pallium of the see of mainz and to discharge the other expenses of his elevation  albert had borrowed        ducats from jakob fugger    fugger article says        ducats   and had obtained permission from pope leo x to conduct the sale of indulgences in his diocese to obtain funds to repay this loan  as long as he forwarded half of the income to the papacy  an agent of the fuggers subsequently traveled in the cardinal s retinue in charge of the cashbox  he procured the services of john tetzel to sell the indulgences 

largely in reaction to the commerce in indulgences  martin luther wrote his famous    theses  which led to the reformation  luther sent these to albert on    october       and according to a false tradition nailed a copy to the door of castle church in wittenberg  albert forwarded the theses to rome  suspecting luther of heresy  when the imperial election of      drew near  partisans of the two leading candidates  king charles i of spain and francis i of france  eagerly solicited the vote of the prince archbishop of mainz  and albert appears to have received a large amount of money for his vote  the electors eventually chose charles  who became the emperor charles v 

albert s large and liberal ideas  his friendship with ulrich von hutten  and his political ambitions  appear to have raised hopes that he could be won over to protestantism  but after the german peasants  war of      he ranged himself definitely among the supporters of catholicism  and was among the princes who joined the league of dessau in july      

cardinal albert needed a prestigious church building that met his expectations at a central location in his  residenz  town  albert feared for his peace of mind in heaven  and collected more than       relics and    holy skeletons which needed to be stored  these precious treasures  known as  hallesches heilthum   indirectly related to the sale of indulgences which had triggered the reformation a few years before  then the cardinal and the catholic members of the town council wanted to repress the growing influence of the reformation by holding far grander masses and services in a new church dedicated solely to saint mary 
albert s hostility towards the reformers  however  was not so extreme as that of his brother joachim i  elector of brandenburg  and he appears to have exerted himself towards peace  although he was a member of the league of nuremberg  formed in      as a counterpoise to the league of schmalkalden  the new doctrines nevertheless made considerable progress in his dominions  and he was compelled to grant religious liberty to the inhabitants of magdeburg in return for         florins  during his later years showed more intolerance towards the protestants  and favoured the teaching of the jesuits in his dominions 

the market church of our lady in halle  which had been built to defend against the spread of reformation sympathies  was the very spot where justus jonas officially introduced the reformation into halle with his good friday sermon in       the service must have been at least partly conducted in the open air  because at that time construction had only been finished at the eastern end of the nave  jonas began a successful preaching crusade and attracted so many people that the church overflowed  cardinal albert left the town permanently after the estates   st  nde   in the city had announced that they would take over his enormous debt at the bank of jacob fugger  halle became protestant and in      jonas was appointed as priest to st  mary s and in      bishop over the city 

albert adorned the collegiate church   stiftskirche   at halle and the cathedral at mainz in sumptuous fashion  and took as his motto the words  domine  dilexi decorem domus tuae   latin for   lord  i admired the adornment of your house     a generous patron of art and learning  he counted erasmus among his friends 

albert died at the martinsburg  mainz in      

 




albert  duke of prussia

albert of prussia       may        march       was the   th grand master of the teutonic knights  who after converting to lutheranism  became the first ruler of the duchy of prussia  the secularized state that emerged from the former monastic state of the teutonic knights  albert was the first european ruler to establish lutheranism  and thus protestantism  as the official state religion of his lands  he proved instrumental in the political spread of protestantism in its early stage  ruling the prussian lands for nearly six decades               

a member of the brandenburg ansbach branch of the house of hohenzollern  albert became grand master  where his skill in political administration and leadership ultimately succeeded in reversing the decline of the teutonic order  but albert  who was sympathetic to the demands of martin luther  rebelled against the catholic church and the holy roman empire by converting the teutonic state into a protestant and hereditary realm  the duchy of prussia  for which he paid homage to his uncle  sigismund i  king of poland  that arrangement was confirmed by the treaty of krak  w in       albert pledged a personal oath to the king and in return was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs 

albert s rule in prussia was fairly prosperous  although he had some trouble with the peasantry  the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the catholic church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established prussian court  he was active in imperial politics  joining the league of torgau in       and acted in unison with the protestants in plotting to overthrow emperor charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may       albert established schools in every town and founded k  nigsberg university in       he promoted culture and arts  patronising the works of erasmus reinhold and caspar hennenberger  during the final years of his rule  albert was forced to raise taxes instead of further confiscating now depleted church lands  causing peasant rebellion  the intrigues of the court favourites johann funck and paul skali   also led to various religious and political disputes  albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power and died at tapiau on    march       his son  albert frederick  succeeded him as duke of prussia 

albert s dissolution of the teutonic state caused the founding of the duchy of prussia  paving the way for the rise of the house of hohenzollern 

albert was born in ansbach in franconia as the third son of frederick i  margrave of brandenburg ansbach  his mother was sophia  daughter of casimir iv jagiellon  grand duke of lithuania and king of poland  and his wife elisabeth of austria  he was raised for a career in the church and spent some time at the court of hermann iv of hesse  elector of cologne  who appointed him canon of the cologne cathedral 
not only was he quite religious  he was also interested in mathematics and science and sometimes is claimed to have contradicted the teachings of the church in favour of scientific theories  his career was forwarded by the church  however  and institutions of the catholic clerics supported his early advancement 

turning to a more active life  albert accompanied emperor maximilian i to italy in      and after his return spent some time in the kingdom of hungary 

duke frederick of saxony  grand master of the teutonic order  died in december       albert was chosen as his successor early in      in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle  sigismund i the old  grand duke of lithuania and king of poland  would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern prussia  which had been held by the order under polish suzerainty since the second peace of thorn        

the new grand master  aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy  refused to submit to the crown of poland  as war over the order s existence appeared inevitable  albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on protracted negotiations with emperor maximilian i  the ill feeling  influenced by the ravages of members of the order in poland  culminated in a war which began in december      and devastated prussia  albert was granted a four year truce early in      

the dispute was referred to emperor charles v and other princes  but as no settlement was reached albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war  for this purpose he visited the diet of nuremberg in       where he made the acquaintance of the reformer andreas osiander  by whose influence albert was won over to protestantism 

the grand master then journeyed to wittenberg  where he was advised by martin luther to abandon the rules of his order  to marry  and to convert prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself  this proposal  which was understandably appealing to albert  had already been discussed by some of his relatives  but it was necessary to proceed cautiously  and he assured pope adrian vi that he was anxious to reform the order and punish the knights who had adopted lutheran doctrines  luther for his part did not stop at the suggestion  but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the prussians  while albert s brother  margrave george of brandenburg ansbach  laid the scheme before their uncle  sigismund i the old of poland 

after some delay sigismund assented to the offer  with the provision that prussia should be treated as a polish fiefdom  and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a treaty concluded at krak  w  albert pledged a personal oath to sigismund i and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on    february      

the estates of the land then met at k  nigsberg and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke  who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of luther  this transition did not  however  take place without protest  summoned before the imperial court of justice  albert refused to appear and was proscribed  while the order elected a new grand master  walter von cronberg  who received prussia as a fief at the imperial diet of augsburg  as the german princes were experiencing the tumult of the reformation  the german peasants  war  and the wars against the ottoman turks  they did not enforce the ban on the duke  and agitation against him soon died away 

in imperial politics albert was fairly active  joining the league of torgau in       he acted in unison with the protestants  and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may       for various reasons  however  poverty and personal inclination among others  he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period 
the early years of albert s rule in prussia were fairly prosperous  although he had some trouble with the peasantry  the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court  he did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life  in       in spite of some opposition  he founded k  nigsberg university  where he appointed his friend andreas osiander to a professorship in       albert also paid for the printing of the astronomical  prutenic tables  compiled by erasmus reinhold and the first maps of prussia by caspar hennenberger 

osiander s appointment was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of albert s reign  osiander s divergence from luther s doctrine of justification by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with philip melanchthon  who had adherents in k  nigsberg  and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town  the duke strenuously supported osiander  and the area of the quarrel soon broadened  there were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles  the burden of taxation was heavy  and albert s rule became unpopular 

after osiander s death in       albert favoured a preacher named johann funck  who  with an adventurer named paul skali    exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense  the state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the possibility of albert s early death and the need  should that happen  to appoint a regent  as his only son  albert frederick was still a mere youth  the duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of osiander  and the climax came in      when the estates appealed to king sigismund ii augustus of poland  albert s cousin  who sent a commission to k  nigsberg  skali   saved his life by flight  but funck was executed  the question of the regency was settled  and a form of lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers 
virtually deprived of power  the duke lived for two more years  and died at tapiau on    march      of the plague  along with his wife  cornelis floris de vriendt designed his tomb within k  nigsberg cathedral 

albert was a voluminous letter writer  and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time 

although albert has received relatively little recognition in german history  his dissolution of the teutonic state caused the founding of the duchy of prussia  which would eventually become arguably the most powerful german state and instrumental in uniting the whole of germany  albert is therefore often seen as the father of the prussian nation  and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of germany  he was a skilled political administrator and leader  and effectively reversed the decline of the teutonic order  until he betrayed it by transforming the order s lands into his own duchy  secularizing it in the process 

albert was the first german noble to support luther s ideas and in      founded the university of k  nigsberg  the albertina  as a rival to the roman catholic cracow academy  it was the second lutheran university in the german states  after the university of marburg 

a relief of albert over the renaissance era portal of k  nigsberg castle s southern wing was created by andreas hess in      according to plans by christoph r  mer  another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the albertina s original campus  this depiction  which showed the duke with his sword over his shoulder  was the popular  albertus   the symbol of the university  the original was moved to k  nigsberg public library to protect it from the elements  while the sculptor paul kimritz created a duplicate for the wall  another version of the  albertus  by lothar sauer was included at the entrance of the k  nigsberg state and royal library 

in      friedrich reusch created a sandstone bust of albert at the regierungsgeb  ude  the administrative building for regierungsbezirk k  nigsberg  on    may      reusch premiered a famous statue of albert at k  nigsberg castle with the inscription   albert of brandenburg  last grand master  first duke in prussia   albert wolff also designed an equestrian statue of albert located at the new campus of the albertina  king s gate contains a statue of albert 

albert was oft honored in the quarter maraunenhof in northern k  nigsberg  its main street was named herzog albrecht allee in       its town square  k  nig ottokar platz  was renamed herzog albrecht platz in      to match its church  the herzog albrecht ged  chtniskirche 

albert married first  to dorothea    august        april        daughter of king frederick i of denmark  in       they had six children 


he married secondly to anna maria            march        daughter of eric i  duke of brunswick l  neburg  in       the couple had two children

aachen

aachen    or bad aachen  french and traditional english  aix la chapelle     is a spa and border city in north rhine westphalia  germany  aachen developed from a roman settlement and spa  subsequently becoming the preferred medieval imperial residence of charlemagne  and  from     to       the place where    holy roman emperors were crowned kings of the germans 

aachen is the westernmost city in germany  located near the borders with belgium and the netherlands  west south west of cologne in a former coal mining area  one of germany s leading institutes of higher education in technology  the rwth aachen university is located in the city  aachen s industries include science  engineering and information technology  in       aachen was ranked eighth among cities in germany for innovation 

the name  aachen  is a modern descendant  like southern german     meaning  river  or  stream   from old high german   meaning  water  or  stream   which directly translates  and etymologically corresponds to  latin   referring to the springs  the location has been inhabited by humans since the neolithic era  about       years ago  attracted to its warm mineral springs  latin figures in aachen s roman name   which meant  waters of grannus   referring to the celtic god of healing who was worshipped at the springs  this word became in walloon and in french  and subsequently after charlemagne had his palatine chapel built there in the late  th century and then made the city his empire s capital 

aachen s name in french and german evolved in parallel  the city is known by a variety of different names in other languages 

aachen is at the western end of the benrath line that divides high german to the south from the rest of the west germanic speech area to the north  aachen s local dialect is called and belongs to the ripuarian language 

flint quarries on the lousberg  schneeberg  and k  nigsh  gel  first used during neolithic times              bc   attest to the long occupation of the site of aachen  as do recent finds under the modern city s  elisengarten  pointing to a former settlement from the same period  bronze age  around      bc  settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows  burial mounds  found  for example  on the klausberg  during the iron age  the area was settled by celtic peoples who were perhaps drawn by the marshy aachen basin s hot sulphur springs where they worshipped grannus  god of light and healing 

later  the    hectare roman spa resort town of aquae granni was  according to legend  founded by grenus  under hadrian  around     ad  instead  the fictitious founder refers to the celtic god  and it seems it was the roman  th legion at the start of the  st century ad that first channelled the hot springs into a spa at b  chel  adding at the end of the same century the  m  nstertherme  spa  two water pipelines  and a probable sanctuary dedicated to grannus  a kind of forum  surrounded by colonnades  connected the two spa complexes  there was also an extensive residential area  part of it inhabited by a flourishing jewish community  the romans built bathhouses near burtscheid  a temple precinct called  vernenum  was built near the modern kornelim  nster walheim  today  remains have been found of three bathhouses  including two fountains in the  elisenbrunnen  and the burtscheid bathhouse 

roman civil administration in aachen broke down between the end of the  th and beginning of the  th centuries  rome withdrew its troops from the area  but the town remained populated  by      the town came to be ruled by the ripuarian franks and subordinated to their capital  cologne 

after roman times  pepin the short had a castle residence built in the town  due to the proximity of the hot springs and also for strategic reasons as it is located between the rhineland and northern france  einhard mentions that in         pepin spent both christmas and easter at  aquis villa          and  he  celebrated christmas in the town aquis  and similarly easter   which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months  in the year of his coronation as king of the franks       charlemagne came to spend christmas at aachen for the first time  he remained there in a mansion which he may have extended  although there is no source attesting to any significant building activity at aachen in his time  apart from the building of the palatine chapel  since       cathedral  and the palace  charlemagne spent most winters in aachen between     and his death in      aachen became the focus of his court and the political centre of his empire  after his death  the king was buried in the church which he had built  his original tomb has been lost  while his alleged remains are preserved in the  karlsschrein   the shrine where he was reburied after being declared a saint  his saintliness  however  was never officially acknowledged by the roman curia as such 

in      otto i was crowned king of east francia in the collegiate church built by charlemagne  during the reign of otto ii  the nobles revolted and the west franks  under lothair  raided aachen in the ensuing confusion  aachen was attacked again by odo of champagne  who attacked the imperial palace while conrad ii was absent  odo relinquished it quickly and was killed soon afterwards  the palace and town of aachen had fortifying walls built by order of emperor frederick barbarossa between      and       over the next     years  most kings of germany destined to reign over the holy roman empire were crowned in aachen  the original audience hall built by charlemagne was torn down and replaced by the current city hall in       the last king to be crowned here was ferdinand i in       during the middle ages  aachen remained a city of regional importance  due to its proximity to flanders  it achieved a modest position in the trade in woollen cloths  favoured by imperial privilege  the city remained a free imperial city  subject to the emperor only  but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours  the only dominion it had was over burtscheid  a neighbouring territory ruled by a benedictine abbess  it was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the  aachener reich   even in the late   th century the abbess of burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the duke of j  lich  the city of aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road diggers 

as an imperial city  aachen held certain political privileges that allowed it to remain independent of the troubles of europe for many years  it remained a direct vassal of the holy roman empire throughout most of the middle ages  it was also the site of many important church councils  including the council of     and the council of       a council convened by the antipope paschal iii 

aachen has proved an important site for the production of historical manuscripts  under charlemagne s purview  both the ada gospels and the coronation gospels may have been produced in aachen  in addition  quantities of the other texts in the court library were also produced locally  during the reign of louis the pious              substantial quantities of ancient texts were produced at aachen  including legal manuscripts such as the leges scriptorium group  patristic texts including the five manuscripts of the bamberg pliny group  finally  under lothair i              texts of outstanding quality were still being produced  this however marked the end of the period of manuscript production at aachen 

in       following the invasion of spanish troops from the netherlands  rudolf deposed all protestant office holders in aachen and even went as far as expelling them from the city  from the early   th century  aachen started to lose its power and influence  first the coronations of emperors were moved from aachen to frankfurt  this was followed by the religious wars  and the great fire of       after the destruction of most of the city in       the rebuilding was mostly in the baroque style  the decline of aachen culminated in       when the french  led by general charles dumouriez  occupied aachen 

by the middle of the   th century aachen had become attractive as a spa  not so much because of the effects of the hot springs on the health of its visitors but because aachen was then     and remained well into the   th century     a place of high level prostitution  traces of this hidden agenda of the city s history are found in the   th century guidebooks to aachen as well as to the other spas 

the main indication for visiting patients  ironically  was syphilis  only by the end of the   th century had rheumatism become the most important object of cures at aachen and burtscheid 

aachen was chosen as the site of several important congresses and peace treaties  the first congress of aachen  often referred to as the congress of aix la chapelle in english  on   may       leading to the first treaty of aachen in the same year which ended the war of devolution  the second congress ended with the second treaty in       ending the war of the austrian succession  in       there was a constitutional crisis in the aachen government  and in      aachen lost its status as a free imperial city 

on   february       the peace of lun  ville removed the ownership of aachen and the entire  left bank  of the rhine from germany and granted it to france  in       control of the town was passed to prussia  by an act passed by the congress of vienna  the third congress took place in       to decide the fate of occupied napoleonic france 

by the middle of the   th century  industrialisation had swept away most of the city s medieval rules of production and commerce  although the entirely corrupt remains of the city s medieval constitution were kept in place  compare the famous remarks of georg forster in his  ansichten vom niederrhein   until       when aachen became the  chef lieu du d  partement de la roer  in napoleon s first french empire  in       after the napoleonic wars  the kingdom of prussia took over  the city was one of its most socially and politically backward centres until the end of the   th century  administered within the rhine province  by      the population was         starting in       the railway from cologne to belgium passed through aachen  the city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions until       when the medieval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building and new  better housing was built in the east of the city  where sanitary drainage was easiest  in december       the aachen tramway network was opened  and in      it was electrified  in the   th century and up to the     s  the city was important in the production of railway locomotives and carriages  iron  pins  needles  buttons  tobacco  woollen goods  and silk goods 

after world war i  aachen was occupied by the allies until       along with the rest of german territory west of the rhine  aachen was one of the locations involved in the ill fated rhenish republic  on    october       an armed band took over the city hall  similar actions took place in m  nchen gladbach  duisburg  and krefeld  this republic lasted only about a year 

aachen was heavily damaged during world war ii  the city and its fortified surroundings were laid siege to from    september to    october      by the us  st infantry division with the  rd armored division assisting from the south  around    october the us  nd armored division played their part  coming from the north and getting as close as w  rselen  while the   th infantry division played a crucial role in completing the encirclement of aachen on    october       with reinforcements from the us   th infantry division the battle of aachen then continued involving direct assaults through the heavily defended city  which finally forced the german garrison to surrender on    october       aachen was the first german city to be captured by the allies  and its residents welcomed the soldiers as liberators  the city was destroyed partially     and in some parts completely     during the fighting  mostly by american artillery fire and demolitions carried out by the waffen ss defenders  damaged buildings included the medieval churches of st  foillan  st  paul and st  nicholas  and the rathaus  city hall   although aachen cathedral was largely unscathed  only       inhabitants remained in the city  the rest had followed evacuation orders  its first allied appointed mayor  franz oppenhoff  was assassinated by an ss commando unit 

during the roman period  aachen was the site of a flourishing jewish community  later  during the carolingian empire  a jewish community lived near the royal palace  in      a jew named isaac accompanied the ambassador of charlemagne to harun al rashid  during the   th century  many jews converted to christianity  as shown in the records of the aachen minster  today s cathedral   in       the jews of aachen offered gifts to maximilian i during his coronation ceremony  in       the aachen jewish community was expelled from the city  in       six jews were allowed to return  most of the aachen jews settled in the nearby town of burtscheid  on    may       the jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the prussian king  friedrich wilhelm iii  a jewish cemetery was acquired in             jews lived in the city in       the synagogue was destroyed during kristallnacht in       in       after emigration and arrests      jews remained in the city  after world war ii  only    jews lived there  in             jews were living in aachen  in jewish texts  the city of aachen was called aish  or ash        

the city of aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by product of hosting one of the leading universities of technology in germany with the rwth aachen  rheinisch westf  lische technische hochschule   known especially for mechanical engineering  automotive and manufacturing technology as well as for its research and academic hospital klinikum aachen  one of the largest medical facilities in europe 

aachen is located in the middle of the meuse   rhine euroregion  close to the border tripoint of germany  the netherlands  and belgium  the town of vaals in the netherlands lies nearby at about from aachen s city centre  while the dutch city of heerlen and eupen  the capital of the german speaking community of belgium  are both located about from aachen city centre  aachen lies near the head of the open valley of the wurm  which today flows through the city in canalised form   part of the larger basin of the meuse  and about north of the high fens  which form the northern edge of the eifel uplands of the rhenish massif 

the maximum dimensions of the city s territory are from north to south  and from east to west  the city limits are long  of which border belgium and the netherlands  the highest point in aachen  located in the far southeast of the city  lies at an elevation of      m above sea level  the lowest point  in the north  and on the border with the netherlands  is at      m 

as the westernmost city in germany  and close to the low countries   aachen and the surrounding area belongs to a temperate climate zone  with humid weather  mild winters  and warm summers  because of its location north of the eifel and the high fens and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns  rainfall in aachen  on average      mm year  is comparatively higher than  for example  in bonn  with      mm year   another factor in the local weather forces of aachen is the occurrence of foehn winds on the southerly air currents  which results from the city s geographic location on the northern edge of the eifel 

because the city is surrounded by hills  it suffers from inversion related smog  some areas of the city have become urban heat islands as a result of poor heat exchange  both because of the area s natural geography and from human activity  the city s numerous cold air corridors  which are slated to remain as free as possible from new construction  therefore play an important role in the urban climate of aachen 

the january average is
  while the july average is   precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year 
the geology of aachen is very structurally heterogeneous  the oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the devonian period and include carboniferous sandstone  greywacke  claystone and limestone  these formations are part of the rhenish massif  north of the high fens  in the pennsylvanian subperiod of the carboniferous geological period  these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the variscan orogeny  after this event  and over the course of the following     million years  this area has been continuously flattened 

during the cretaceous period  the ocean penetrated the continent from the direction of the north sea up to the mountainous area near aachen  bringing with it clay  sand  and chalk deposits  while the clay  which was the basis for a major pottery industry in nearby raeren  is mostly found in the lower areas of aachen  the hills of the aachen forest and the lousberg were formed from upper cretaceous sand and chalk deposits  more recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of aachen and was formed through tertiary and quaternary river and wind activities 

along the major thrust fault of the variscan orogeny  there are over    thermal springs in aachen and burtscheid  additionally  the subsurface of aachen is traversed by numerous active faults that belong to the rurgraben fault system  which has been responsible for numerous earthquakes in the past  including the      d  ren earthquake and the      roermond earthquake  which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the netherlands 

aachen has         inhabitants  as of    december        of whom         are female  and         are male 

the unemployment rate in the city is  as of april           percent  at the end of       the foreign born residents of aachen made up      percent of the total population  a significant portion of foreign residents are students at the rwth aachen university 

the city is divided into seven administrative districts  or boroughs  each with its own district council  district leader  and district authority  the councils are elected locally by those who live within the district  and these districts are further subdivided into smaller sections for statistical purposes  with each sub district named by a two digit number 

the districts of aachen  including their constituent statistical districts  are 

regardless of official statistical designations  there are    neighbourhoods and communities within aachen  here arranged by district 

the following cities and communities border aachen  clockwise from the northwest 
herzogenrath  w  rselen  eschweiler  stolberg and roetgen  which are all in the district of aachen   raeren  kelmis and plombi  res  l  ttich province in belgium  as well as vaals  gulpen wittem  simpelveld  heerlen and kerkrade  all in limburg province in the netherlands  

aachen cathedral was erected on the orders of charlemagne in     ad and was  on completion in      the largest cathedral north of the alps  it was modelled after the basilica of san vitale  in ravenna  italy  and was built by odo of metz  charlemagne also desired for the chapel to compete with the lateran palace  both in quality and authority  it was originally built in the carolingian style  including marble covered walls  and mosaic inlay on the dome  on his death  charlemagne s remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day  the cathedral was extended several times in later ages  turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles  the throne and gallery portion date from the ottonian  with portions of the original opus sectile floor still visible  the   th century saw gables being added to the roof  and after the fire of       the dome was rebuilt  finally  a choir was added around the start of the   th century 

after frederick barbarossa canonised charlemagne  in       the chapel became a destination for pilgrims  for     years  from     to       aachen cathedral was the church of coronation for    german kings and    queens  the church built by charlemagne is still the main attraction of the city  in addition to holding the remains of its founder  it became the burial place of his successor otto iii  in the upper chamber of the gallery  charlemagne s marble throne is housed  aachen cathedral has been designated as a unesco world heritage site 

most of the marble and columns used in the construction of the cathedral were brought from rome and ravenna  including the sarcophagus that charlemagne was eventually laid to rest in  a bronze bear from gaul was placed inside  along with an equestrian statue from ravenna  believed to be theodric  these were in contrast to a wolf and a statue of marcus aurelius in the capitoline  bronze pieces such as the doors and railings were cast in a local foundry  some of which have survived to the present  finally  there is uncertainty surrounding the bronze pine cone in the chapel  and where it was created  wherever it was made  it was also a parallel to a piece in rome  this in old st  peter s basilica 

aachen cathedral treasury has housed  throughout its history  a collection of liturgical objects  the origin of this church treasure is in dispute as some say charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection  while the rest were collected over time  others say all of the objects were collected over time  from such places as jerusalem and constantinople  the location of this treasury has moved over time and was unknown until the   th century when it was located in the matthiaskapelle  st  matthew s chapel  until       when it was moved to the karlskapelle  charles  chapel   from there it was moved to the hungarian chapel in      and in      to its present location next to the allerseelenkapelle  poor souls  chapel   only six of the original carolingian objects have remained  and of those only three are left in aachen  the aachen gospels  a diptych of christ  and an early byzantine silk  the coronation gospels and a reliquary burse of st  stephen were moved to vienna in      and the talisman of charlemagne was given as a gift in      to josephine bonaparte and subsequently to rheims cathedral      documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception  typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of charlemagne  the lothar cross  the gospels of otto iii and multiple additional byzantine silks were donated by otto iii  part of the pala d oro and a covering for the aachen gospels were made of gold donated by henry ii  frederick barbarossa donated the candelabrum that adorns the dome and also once  crowned  the shrine of charlemagne  which was placed underneath in       charles iv donated a pair of reliquaries  louis xi gave  in       the crown of margaret of york  and  in       another arm reliquary of charlemagne  maximilian i and charles v both gave numerous works of art by hans von reutlingen  continuing the tradition  objects continued to be donated until the present  each indicative of the period of its gifting  with the last documented gift being a chalice from      made by ewald matar   

the aachen rathaus   english  aachen city hall or aachen town hall  dated from       lies between two central squares  the  markt   marketplace  and the  katschhof   between city hall and cathedral   the coronation hall is on the first floor of the building  inside you can find five frescoes by the aachen artist alfred rethel which show legendary scenes from the life of charlemagne  as well as charlemagne s signature  also  precious replicas of the imperial regalia are kept here

aachen is twinned with 







agate

agate is a rock consisting primarily of cryptocrystalline silica  chiefly chalcedony  alternating with microgranular quartz  it is characterized by its fineness of grain and variety of color  although agates may be found in various kinds of host rock  they are classically associated with volcanic rocks and can be common in certain metamorphic rocks 

the stone was given its name by theophrastus  a greek philosopher and naturalist  who discovered the stone along the shore line of the river achates    in sicily  sometime between the  th and  rd centuries bc  colorful agates and other chalcedonies were obtained over       years ago from the achates river  now called dirillo 

agate is one of the most common materials used in the art of hardstone carving  and has been recovered at a number of ancient sites  indicating its widespread use in the ancient world  for example  archaeological recovery at the knossos site on crete illustrates its role in bronze age minoan culture 

most agates occur as nodules in volcanic rocks or ancient lavas  in former cavities produced by volatiles in the original molten mass  which were then filled  wholly or partially  by siliceous matter deposited in regular layers upon the walls  agate has also been known to fill veins or cracks in volcanic or altered rock underlain by granitic intrusive masses  such agates  when cut transversely  exhibit a succession of parallel lines  often of extreme tenuity  giving a banded appearance to the section  such stones are known as  banded agate    riband agate  and  striped agate  

in the formation of an ordinary agate  it is probable that waters containing silica in solution   derived  perhaps  from the decomposition of some of the silicates in the lava itself   percolated through the rock and deposited a siliceous gel in the interior of the vesicles  variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers  so that bands of chalcedony often alternate with layers of crystalline quartz  several vapour vesicles may unite while the rock is still viscous  and thus form a large cavity which may become the home of an agate of exceptional size  thus a brazilian geode lined with amethyst and weighing     tons was exhibited at the d  sseldorf exhibition of       perhaps the most comprehensive review of agate chemistry is a recent text by moxon cited below 

the first deposit on the wall of a cavity  forming the  skin  of the agate  is generally a dark greenish mineral substance  like celadonite  delessite or  green earth   which are rich in iron probably derived from the decomposition of the augite in the enclosing volcanic rock  this green silicate may give rise by alteration to a brown iron oxide  limonite   producing a rusty appearance on the outside of the agate nodule  the outer surface of an agate  freed from its matrix  is often pitted and rough  apparently in consequence of the removal of the original coating  the first layer spread over the wall of the cavity has been called the  priming   and upon this base  zeolitic minerals may be deposited 

many agates are hollow  since deposition has not proceeded far enough to fill the cavity  and in such cases the last deposit commonly consists of drusy quartz  sometimes amethystine  having the apices of the crystals directed towards the free space so as to form a crystal lined cavity or geode 

when the matrix in which the agates are embedded disintegrates  they are set free  the agates are extremely resistant to weathering and remain as nodules in the soil  or are deposited as gravel in streams and along shorelines 

agates can also be found in sedimentary rocks  they need a cavity to form  so they are typically seen in limestone  dolomite  and shale which may have shells  tree branches  or roots in them that later decay away  with the void created  silica rich fluids can enter the cavity and precipitate chalcedony in curved bands forming agates  other quartz classes like amethyst or opal may then form the inner most band inside the geode 

a mexican agate  showing only a single eye  has received the name of  cyclops agate   included matter of a green  golden  red  black or other color or combinations embedded in the chalcedony and disposed in filaments and other forms suggestive of vegetable growth  gives rise to dendritic or moss agate   dendritic  agates have fern like patterns in them formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides  other types of included matter deposited during agate building include sagenitic growths  radial mineral crystals  and chunks of entrapped detritus  such as sand  ash  or mud   occasionally agate fills a void left by decomposed vegetative material such as a tree limb or root and is called limb cast agate due to its appearance  enhydro agate contains tiny inclusions of water  sometimes with air bubbles 

 turritella agate  is formed from silicified fossil  elimia tenera   erroneously considered  turritella   shells   e  tenera  are spiral freshwater gastropods having elongated  spiral shells composed of many whorls  similarly  coral  petrified wood and other organic remains or porous rocks can also become agatized  agatized coral is often referred to as petoskey stone or agate 

 coldwater agates  such as the lake michigan cloud agate  did not form under volcanic processes  and instead formed within the limestone and dolostone bedrock of ancient oceans  like volcanic origin agates   coldwater agates  formed from silica gels that lined pockets and seams within the bedrock  these agates are typically less colorful  with banded lines of grey and white chalcedony 

 greek agate  is a name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in sicily back to     bc  the greeks used it for making jewelry and beads  even though the stone had been around centuries and was known to both the sumerians and the egyptians  both who used the gem for decoration and for playing important parts in their religious ceremonies  any agate of this color from sicily  once an ancient greek colony  is called greek agate 

 brazilian agate  is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules  these occur in brownish tones interlayered with white and gray  quartz forms within these nodules  creating a striking specimen when cut opposite the layered growth axis  it is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes 

certain stones  when examined in thin sections by transmitted light  show a diffraction spectrum due to the extreme delicacy of the successive bands  whence they are termed  rainbow agates   often agate coexists with layers or masses of opal  jasper or crystalline quartz due to ambient variations during the formation process 

 lace agate  is a variety that exhibits a lace like pattern with forms such as eyes  swirls  bands or zigzags  if these predominate  it is called  lattice agate     crazy lace agate   found in mexico  is often brightly colored and complexly patterned   blue lace agate  is found in africa and is especially hard 

 polyhedroid agate  is agate which has grown in a flat sided shape similar to a polyhedron  when sliced  it often shows a characteristic layering of concentric polygons  polyhedroid agate is thought to be found only in para  ba state  brazil  it has been suggested that growth is not crystallographically controlled but is due to the filling in of spaces between pre existing crystals which have since dissolved

industrial uses of agate exploit its hardness  ability to retain a highly polished surface finish and resistance to chemical attack  it has traditionally been used to make knife edge bearings for laboratory balances and precision pendulums  and sometimes to make mortars and pestles to crush and mix chemicals  it has also been used for centuries for leather burnishing tools 

the decorative arts use it to make ornaments such as pins  brooches or other types of jewellery  paper knives  inkstands  marbles and seals  agate is also still used today for decorative displays  cabochons  beads  carvings and intarsia art as well as face polished and tumble polished specimens of varying size and origin  idar oberstein was one of the centers which made use of agate on an industrial scale  where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the european market  this became a globalized business around the turn of the   th century  idar oberstein imported large quantities of agate from brazil  as ship s ballast  making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes  they produced colored beads that were sold around the globe  agates have long been used in arts and crafts  the sanctuary of a presbyterian church in yachats  oregon  has six windows with panes made of agates collected from the local beaches 
respiratory diseases such as silicosis and higher incidence of tuberculosis among workers involved in the agate industry has been reported from india and china 






aspirin

aspirin  also known as acetylsalicylic acid  asa   is a medication used to treat pain  fever  or inflammation  specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include kawasaki disease  pericarditis  and rheumatic fever  aspirin given shortly after a heart attack decreases the risk of death  aspirin is also used long term to help prevent further heart attacks  ischaemic strokes  and blood clots in people at high risk  it may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer  particularly colorectal cancer  for pain or fever  effects typically begin within    minutes  aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug  nsaid  and works similarly to other nsaids but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets 
one common adverse effect is an upset stomach  more significant side effects include stomach ulcers  stomach bleeding  and worsening asthma  bleeding risk is greater among those who are older  drink alcohol  take other nsaids  or are on other blood thinners  aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy  it is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of reye syndrome  high doses may result in ringing in the ears 
a precursor to aspirin found in leaves from the willow tree has been used for its health effects for at least       years  in       chemist charles fr  d  ric gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time  for the next fifty years  other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient methods to make it  in       scientists at the bayer company began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less irritating replacement medication for common salicylate medicines  by       bayer had named it  aspirin  and sold it around the world  aspirin s popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations  the word  aspirin  was bayer s brand name  however  their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries 
aspirin is one of the most widely used medications globally  with an estimated     to     billion pills  consumed each year  it is on the world health organization s  who s  list of essential medicines  the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system  the wholesale cost in the developing world is        to        usd per dose  the cost for a typical month of medication in the united states is less than us        it is available as a generic medication 
aspirin is used in the treatment of a number of conditions  including fever  pain  rheumatic fever  and inflammatory diseases  such as rheumatoid arthritis  pericarditis  and kawasaki disease  lower doses of aspirin have also been shown to reduce the risk of death from a heart attack  or the risk of stroke in people who are at high risk or who have cardiovascular disease  but not in elderly people who are otherwise healthy  there is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer  though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear  in the united states  low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between    and    years old who have a more than     risk of cardiovascular disease  and are not at an increased risk of bleeding  and who are otherwise healthy 

aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain  but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin is more likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding  aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps  bloating  gastric distension  or acute skin irritation  as with other nsaids  combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone  effervescent formulations of aspirin relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets  which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines  topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain 

aspirin  either by itself or in a combined formulation  effectively treats certain types of a headache  but its efficacy may be questionable for others  secondary headaches  meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma  should be promptly treated by a medical provider 

among primary headaches  the international classification of headache disorders distinguishes between tension headache  the most common   migraine  and cluster headache  aspirin or other over the counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headache 

aspirin  especially as a component of an aspirin paracetamol caffeine combination  is considered a first line therapy in the treatment of migraine  and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan  it is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning 

like its ability to control pain  aspirin s ability to control fever is due to its action on the prostaglandin system through its irreversible inhibition of cox  although aspirin s use as an antipyretic in adults is well established  many medical societies and regulatory agencies  including the american academy of family physicians  the american academy of pediatrics  and the u s  food and drug administration  fda   strongly advise against using aspirin for treatment of fever in children because of the risk of reye s syndrome  a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection  because of the risk of reye s syndrome in children  in       the fda required labeling on all aspirin containing medications advising against its use in children and teenagers 

aspirin is used as an anti inflammatory agent for both acute and long term inflammation  as well as for treatment of inflammatory diseases  such as rheumatoid arthritis 

aspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a myocardial infarction  heart attack  

for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke  taking aspirin daily for two years prevented   in    from having a cardiovascular problem  heart attack  stroke  or death   but also caused non fatal bleeding problems to occur in   of     people  low dose aspirin appears useful for people less than     kg while higher dose aspirin is required to benefit those over     kg 

in those with no previous history of heart disease  aspirin has been thought to decrease the risk of a non fatal myocardial infarction but not to change the overall risk of death  one study found that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke  taking aspirin daily for   year prevents   in       from having a non fatal heart attack or stroke  but caused   in       to have a non fatal bleeding event  however  the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a heart attack or stroke  a large trial from      in healthy people who were at least    years old  found no difference in preventing cardiovascular events  but a higher risk of serious bleeding 

aspirin appears to offer little benefit to those at lower risk of heart attack or stroke   for instance  those without a history of these events or with pre existing disease  some studies recommend aspirin on a case by case basis  while others have suggested the risks of other events  such as gastrointestinal bleeding  were enough to outweigh any potential benefit  and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely  aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease 

complicating the use of aspirin for prevention is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance  for people who are resistant  aspirin s efficacy is reduced  some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin 

after percutaneous coronary interventions  pcis   such as the placement of a coronary artery stent  a u s  agency for healthcare research and quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely  frequently  aspirin is combined with an adp receptor inhibitor  such as clopidogrel  prasugrel  or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots  this is called dual antiplatelet therapy  dapt   united states and european union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long  and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery  u s  guidelines recommend dapt for at least    months  while eu guidelines recommend dapt for        months after a drug eluting stent placement  however  they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after dapt is complete 

aspirin is thought to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer  this effect is particularly beneficial for colorectal cancer  crc  but must be taken for at least         years to see this benefit  it may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer  breast cancer  and prostate cancer 

some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk  others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk  given this uncertainty  the      united states preventive services task force guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of crc in people with average risk  nine years later however  the uspstf issued a grade b recommendation for the use of low dose aspirin     to      mg day   for the primary prevention of cvd  cardiovascular disease  and crc in adults    to    years of age who have a     or greater    year cvd risk  are not at increased risk for bleeding  have a life expectancy of at least    years  and are willing to take low dose aspirin daily for at least    years  

aspirin is a first line treatment for the fever and joint pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever  the therapy often lasts for one to two weeks  and is rarely indicated for longer periods  after fever and pain have subsided  the aspirin is no longer necessary  since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease  naproxen has been shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic  but due to the limited clinical experience  naproxen is recommended only as a second line treatment 

along with rheumatic fever  kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its effectiveness 

low dose aspirin supplementation has moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre eclampsia  this benefit is greater when started in early pregnancy  there is no evidence that aspirin prevents dementia 

for some people  aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others  an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity  one study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men  and a different  aggregate study of       people found     were resistant 
a study in     italian people  though  found  of the apparent     aspirin resistant subjects  only    were truly resistant  and the others were noncompliant 
another study of     healthy volunteers found no subjects who were truly resistant  but some had  pseudoresistance  reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption  

adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes  which vary slightly from country to country  for example      mg in britain and      mg  or   grains  in the united states  smaller doses are based on these standards   e g        mg and     mg tablets  the     mg    grain  tablets are commonly called  baby aspirin  or  baby strength   because they were originally   but no longer   intended to be administered to infants and children  no medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the     mg and the     mg tablets  the dose required for benefit appears to depend on a person s weight  for those less than     kg low dose is effective for preventing cardiovascular disease while in those who weight more than     kg higher doses are required 

in general  for adults  doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis  with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever  for the prevention of myocardial infarction  mi  in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease  much lower doses are taken once daily 

march      recommendations from the uspstf on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged         and women aged         to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in mi for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage  the whi study said regular low dose     or     mg  aspirin female users had a     lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a     lower risk of death from any cause  low dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events  and lower aspirin doses     or     mg day  may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long term prevention 

in children with kawasaki disease  aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight  initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks 

aspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen  or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to nsaids  and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or nsaid precipitated bronchospasm  owing to its effect on the stomach lining  manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers  mild diabetes  or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin  even if none of these conditions is present  the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin  people with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates  aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose   phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency  particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease  use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency  people with kidney disease  hyperuricemia  or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys  ability to excrete uric acid  thus may exacerbate these conditions  aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms  as this has been linked with reye s syndrome 

aspirin use has been shown to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding  although some enteric coated formulations of aspirin are advertised as being  gentle to the stomach   in one study  enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk  combining aspirin with other nsaids has also been shown to further increase this risk  using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding 

blockade of cox   by aspirin apparently results in the upregulation of cox   as part of a gastric defense and that taking cox   inhibitors concurrently with aspirin increases the gastric mucosal erosion  therefore  caution should be exercised if combining aspirin with any  natural  supplements with cox   inhibiting properties  such as garlic extracts  curcumin  bilberry  pine bark  ginkgo  fish oil  resveratrol  genistein  quercetin  resorcinol  and others 

in addition to enteric coating   buffering  is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding  buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach  although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed  almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used  bufferin  for example  uses magnesium oxide  other preparations use calcium carbonate 

taking it with vitamin c has been investigated as a method of protecting the stomach lining  taking equal doses of vitamin c and aspirin may decrease the amount of stomach damage that occurs compared to taking aspirin alone 

large doses of salicylate  a metabolite of aspirin  cause temporary tinnitus  ringing in the ears  based on experiments in rats  via the action on arachidonic acid and nmda receptors cascade 

reye s syndrome  a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver  can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection  from      through            cases of reye s syndrome in people younger than    were reported to the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  of these      reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of reye s syndrome  most commonly with a respiratory infection  chickenpox  or diarrhea  salicylates were detectable in       of children for whom test results were reported  after the association between reye s syndrome and aspirin was reported  and safety measures to prevent it  including a surgeon general s warning  and changes to the labeling of aspirin containing drugs  were implemented  aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the united states  as did the number of reported cases of reye s syndrome  a similar decline was found in the united kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued  the u s  food and drug administration now recommends aspirin  or aspirin containing products  should not be given to anyone under the age of    who has a fever  and the uk national health service recommends children who are under    years of age should not take aspirin  unless it is on the advice of a doctor 

for a small number of people  taking aspirin can result in symptoms resembling an allergic reaction  including hives  swelling  and headache  the reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy  but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin  resulting in an overdose 

aspirin and other nsaids  such as ibuprofen  may delay the healing of skin wounds  aspirin may however help heal venous leg ulcers that have not healed following usual treatment 

aspirin can induce swelling of skin tissues in some people  in one study  angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the people  however  when the aspirin was taken alone  it did not cause angioedema in these people  the aspirin had been taken in combination with another nsaid induced drug when angioedema appeared 

aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on mri scans of   to     mm or smaller  hypointense  dark holes  patches  such cerebral microbleeds are important  since they often occur prior to ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage  binswanger disease  and alzheimer s disease 

a study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of      mg per day estimated an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage  ich  of    events per        persons  in comparison  the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was     events per        persons  and a reduction of    events per        persons in ischemic stroke  in cases where ich already has occurred  aspirin use results in higher mortality  with a dose of about      mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ich around          confidence interval     to      

aspirin and other nsaids can cause abnormally high blood levels of potassium by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis  however  these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state 

aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to    days  in one study     of      people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding  twenty had diffuse bleeding and    had bleeding from a site  diffuse  but not discrete  bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other nsaids in    of the    diffuse bleeding people 

on   july       the fda toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  nsaid   aspirin is an nsaid but is not affected by the new warnings 

aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic  in acute poisoning  a single large dose is taken  in chronic poisoning  higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time  acute overdose has a mortality rate of     chronic overdose is more commonly lethal  with a mortality rate of      chronic overdose may be especially severe in children  toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments  including activated charcoal  intravenous dextrose and normal saline  sodium bicarbonate  and dialysis  the diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate  the active metabolite of aspirin  by automated spectrophotometric methods  plasma salicylate levels in general range from           mg l after usual therapeutic doses            mg l in people taking high doses and             mg l following acute overdose  salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate  methyl salicylate  and sodium salicylate 

aspirin is known to interact with other drugs  for example  acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates  and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs  aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein binding sites in the blood  including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide  warfarin  methotrexate  phenytoin  probenecid  valproic acid  as well as interfering with beta oxidation  an important part of valproate metabolism   and other nsaids  corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin  ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention  the pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin  and it is known to compete with penicillin g for renal tubular secretion  aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin c 

aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates  carbonates  citrates  or hydroxides of the alkali metals  it is stable in dry air  but gradually hydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids  in solution with alkalis  the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate 

like flour mills  factories that make aspirin tablets must pay attention to how much of the powder gets into the air inside the building  because the powder air mixture can be explosive  the national institute for occupational safety and health  niosh  has set a recommended exposure limit in the united states of    mg m  time weighted average   in       the occupational safety and health administration  osha  set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of    mg m  but this was vacated by the afl cio v  osha decision in      

the synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction  salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride  an acid derivative  causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid s hydroxyl group into an ester group  r oh     r ococh   this process yields aspirin and acetic acid  which is considered a byproduct of this reaction  small amounts of sulfuric acid  and occasionally phosphoric acid  are almost always used as a catalyst  this method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs 


formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions  yielding salicylic and acetic acids 

aspirin  an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid  is a white  crystalline  weakly acidic substance  with a melting point of   and a boiling point of   its acid dissociation constant  p k   is     at  

polymorphism  or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure  is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients  many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph  for a long time  only one crystal structure for aspirin was known  that aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the     s  the elusive second polymorph was first discovered by vishweshwar and coworkers in       and fine structural details were given by bond  et al   a new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile  the form ii is only stable at    k and reverts to form i at ambient temperature  in the  unambiguous  form i  two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the  acidic  methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds  and in the newly claimed form ii  each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one  with respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups  both polymorphs form identical dimer structures 

in       british pharmacologist john robert vane  then employed by the royal college of surgeons in london  showed aspirin suppressed the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes  for this discovery he was awarded the      nobel prize in physiology or medicine  jointly with sune bergstr  m and bengt ingemar samuelsson 

aspirin s ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase  cox  officially known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase  ptgs  enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis  aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the ptgs enzyme  suicide inhibition   this makes aspirin different from other nsaids  such as diclofenac and ibuprofen   which are reversible inhibitors 

low dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane a in platelets  producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet        days   this antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack  unstable angina  ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack      mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane a release provoked acutely  with the prostaglandin i  synthesis being little affected  however  higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition 

prostaglandins  local hormones produced in the body  have diverse effects  including the transmission of pain information to the brain  modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat  and inflammation  thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots  heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots  and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction 

at least two different types of cyclooxygenases  cox   and cox    are acted on by aspirin  aspirin irreversibly inhibits cox   and modifies the enzymatic activity of cox    cox   normally produces prostanoids  most of which are proinflammatory  aspirin modified ptgs  produces lipoxins  most of which are anti inflammatory  newer nsaid drugs  cox   inhibitors  coxibs   have been developed to inhibit only ptgs   with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects 

however  several of the new cox   inhibitors  such as rofecoxib  vioxx   have been withdrawn in the last decade  after evidence emerged that ptgs  inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke  endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express ptgs   and  by selectively inhibiting ptgs   prostaglandin production  specifically  pgi   prostacyclin  is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels  as ptgs  in platelets is unaffected  thus  the protective anticoagulative effect of pgi  is removed  increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems  since platelets have no dna  they are unable to synthesize new ptgs once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme  an important difference with reversible inhibitors 

furthermore  aspirin  while inhibiting the ability of cox   to form pro inflammatory products such as the prostaglandins  converts this enzyme s activity from a prostaglandin forming cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase like enzyme  aspirin treated cox   metabolizes a variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to specialized proresolving mediators such as the aspirin triggered lipoxins  aspirin triggered resolvins  and aspirin triggered maresins  these mediators possess potent anti inflammatory activity  it is proposed that this aspirin triggered transition of cox   from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti inflammatory effects of aspirin 

aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action  it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous  and hepatic  mitochondria  by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix  where it ionizes once again to release protons  aspirin buffers and transports the protons  when high doses are given  it may actually cause fever  owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain  as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses  in addition  aspirin induces the formation of no radicals in the body  which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation  this reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection  however  evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection  more recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through nf   b  nf   b  a transcription factor complex  plays a central role in many biological processes  including inflammation 

aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid  which itself has anti inflammatory  antipyretic  and analgesic effects  in       salicylic acid was found to activate amp activated protein kinase  which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin  the acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets  acetylation of cellular proteins is a well established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post translational level  aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to cox isoenzymes  these acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin 

acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid  and very little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration  acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the acidic conditions of the stomach  the increased ph and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there  as more of it is ionised  owing to the formation of concretions  aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose  and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to    hours after ingestion 

about          of salicylate in the blood is bound to albumin protein  while the rest remains in the active  ionized state  protein binding is concentration dependent  saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity  the volume of distribution is           l kg  acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates 

as much as     of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver  conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid  and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters  the conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the  acyl glucuronide   the deacetylated conjugate is the  phenolic glucuronide   these metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity  small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid  with large salicylate doses  the kinetics switch from first order to zero order  as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important 

salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid        free salicylic acid        salicylic phenol        and acyl glucuronides       gentisic acid         and     dihydroxybenzoic acid  when small doses  less than      mg in an adult  are ingested  all pathways proceed by first order kinetics  with an elimination half life of about     h to     h  when higher doses of salicylate are ingested  more than   g   the half life becomes much longer     h to    h   because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated  renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated  because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary ph  a     to    fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine ph is increased from   to    the use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination  it was found that short term aspirin use in therapeutic doses might precipitate reversible acute renal failure when the patient was ill with glomerulonephritis or cirrhosis  aspirin for some patients with chronic renal insufficiency and some children with congestive heart failure was contraindicated 

medicines made from willow and other salicylate rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient sumer as well as the ebers papyrus from ancient egypt  hippocrates referred to their use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around     bc  and were part of the pharmacopoeia of western medicine in classical antiquity and the middle ages  willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever  pain and inflammation in the mid eighteenth century  by the nineteenth century pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to salicylic acid  the active component of willow extract 

in       chemist charles fr  d  ric gerhardt treated sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time  in the second half of the nineteenth century  other academic chemists established the compound s chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis  in       scientists at the drug and dye firm bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines  and identified a new way to synthesize it  by       bayer had dubbed this drug aspirin and was selling it around the world  the word  aspirin  was bayer s brand name  rather than the generic name of the drug  however  bayer s rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries  aspirin s popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products 

aspirin s popularity declined after the development of acetaminophen paracetamol in      and ibuprofen in       in the     s and     s  john vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin s effects  while clinical trials and other studies from the     s to the     s established aspirin s efficacy as an anti clotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases  the initial large studies on the use of low dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the     s and     s helped spur reform in clinical research ethics and guidelines for human subject research and us federal law  and are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men  but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women 

aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the twentieth century  and remain strong in the twenty first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes 

bayer lost its trademark for aspirin in the united states in      because it had failed to use the name for its own product and had for years allowed the use of  aspirin  by other manufacturers   today  aspirin is a generic trademark in many countries  aspirin  with a capital  a   remains a registered trademark of bayer in germany  canada  mexico  and in over    other countries  for acetylsalicylic acid in all markets  but using different packaging and physical aspects for each 


aspirin is sometimes used in veterinary medicine as an anticoagulant or to relieve pain associated with musculoskeletal inflammation or osteoarthritis  aspirin should only be given to animals under the direct supervision of a veterinarian  as adverse effects   including gastrointestinal issues   are common  an aspirin overdose in any species may result in salicylate poisoning  characterized by hemorrhaging  seizures  coma  and even death 

dogs are better able to tolerate aspirin than cats are  cats metabolize aspirin slowly because they lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin  making it potentially toxic if dosing is not spaced out properly  no clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given     mg kg of aspirin every    hours for   weeks  but the recommended dose for relief of pain and fever and for treating blood clotting diseases in cats is     mg kg every    hours to allow for metabolization 

aspirin has shown some promise in the treatment of laminitis in horses 





abner

in the first and second books of samuel  abner       avner   was saul s uncle and commander in chief of his army    samuel                his name also appears as  abiner son of ner   where the longer form abiner means  my father is ner  

abner is initially mentioned incidentally in saul s history    samuel                      first appearing as the son of ner  saul s uncle  and the commander of saul s army  he then comes to the story again as the commander who introduced david to saul following david s killing of goliath  he is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous battle of gilboa when saul s power was crushed  seizing the youngest but only surviving of saul s sons  ish bosheth  abner set him up as king over israel at mahanaim  east of the jordan  david  who was accepted as king by judah alone  was meanwhile reigning at hebron  and for some time war was carried on between the two parties 

the only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy  inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at gibeon between twelve chosen men from each side  in which the whole twenty four seem to have perished    samuel        in the general engagement which followed  abner was defeated and put to flight  he was closely pursued by asahel  brother of joab  who is said to have been  light of foot as a wild roe     samuel        as asahel would not desist from the pursuit  though warned  abner was compelled to slay him in self defence  this originated a deadly feud between the leaders of the opposite parties  for joab  as next of kin to asahel  was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood  however  according to josephus  in antiquities  book    chapter    joab had forgiven abner for the death of his brother  asahel  the reason being that abner had slain asahel honorably in combat after he had first warned asahel and had no other choice but to kill him out of self defense  this battle was part of a civil war between david and ish bosheth  the son of saul  after this battle abner switched to the side of david and granted him control over the tribe of benjamin  this act put abner in david s favor  the real reason that joab killed abner was that he became a threat to his rank of general  he then justifies it later by mentioning his brother 

for some time afterward the war was carried on  the advantage being invariably on the side of david  at length  ish bosheth lost the main prop of his tottering cause by accusing abner of sleeping with rizpah  cf    samuel       one of saul s concubines  an alliance which  according to contemporary notions  would imply pretensions to the throne  cf    samuel      ff   

abner was indignant at the rebuke  and immediately opened negotiations with david  who welcomed him on the condition that his wife michal should be restored to him  this was done  and the proceedings were ratified by a feast  almost immediately after  however  joab  who had been sent away  perhaps intentionally returned and slew abner at the gate of hebron  the ostensible motive for the assassination was a desire to avenge asahel  and this would be a sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time  the conduct of david after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act  though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators    samuel          cf    kings     ff   

david had abner buried in hebron  as it states in   samuel           and david said to all the people who were with him   rend your clothes and gird yourselves with sackcloth  and wail before abner   and king david went after the bier  and they buried abner in hebron  and the king raised his voice and wept on abner s grave  and all the people wept  

shortly after abner s death  ish bosheth was assassinated as he slept    samuel     and david became king of the reunited kingdoms    samuel    

the site known as the tomb of abner is located not far from the cave of the patriarchs in hebron and receives visitors throughout the year  many travelers have recorded visiting the tomb over the centuries 

benjamin of tudela  who began his journeys in       wrote in the journal   the valley of eshkhol is north of the mountain upon which hebron stood  and the cave of makhpela is east thereof  a bow shot west of the cave is the sepulchre of abner the son of ner  

a rabbi in the   th century records visiting the tomb as reprinted in elkan nathan adler s book  jewish travellers in the middle ages     firsthand accounts   the account states   i  jacob  the son of r  nathaniel ha cohen  journeyed with much difficulty  but god helped me to enter the holy land  and i saw the graves of our righteous patriarchs in hebron and the grave of abner the son of ner   adler postulates that the visit must have occurred prior to saladin s capture of jerusalem in      

rabbi moses basola records visiting the tomb in       he states   abner s grave is in the middle of hebron  the muslims built a mosque over it   another visitor in the     s states that  at the entrance to the market in hebron  at the top of the hill against the wall  abner ben ner is buried  in a church  in a cave   this visit was recorded in sefer yihus ha tzaddiqim  book of genealogy of the righteous   a collection of travelogues from       abraham moshe lunz reprinted the book in      

menahem mendel of kamenitz  considered the first hotelier in the land of israel  wrote about the tomb of abner is his      book  korot ha itim   which was translated into english as  the book of the occurrences of the times to jeshurun in the land of israel   he states     here i write of the graves of the righteous to which i paid my respects  hebron     described above is the character and order of behavior of those coming to pray at the cave of ha machpelah  i went there  between the stores  over the grave of avner ben ner and was required to pay a yishmaeli     the grave was in his courtyard     to allow me to enter   

the author and traveler j  j  benjamin mentioned visiting the tomb in his book  eight years in asia and africa         hanover   he states   on leaving the sepulchre of the patriarchs  and proceeding on the road leading to the jewish quarter  to the left of the courtyard  is seen a turkish dwelling house  by the side of which is a small grotto  to which there is a descent of several steps  this is the tomb of abner  captain of king saul  it is held in much esteem by the arabs  and the proprietor of it takes care that it is always kept in the best order  he requires from those who visit it a small gratuity   

the british scholar israel abrahams wrote in his      book  the book of delight and other papers    hebron was the seat of david   s rule over judea  abner was slain here by joab  and was buried here     they still show abner   s tomb in the garden of a large house within the city  by the pool at hebron were slain the murderers of ishbosheth     

over the years the tomb fell into disrepair and neglect  it was closed to the public in       in       a group of    israeli women filed a petition with the supreme court requesting the government to reopen the tomb of abner  more requests were made over the years and eventually arrangements were made to have the site open to the general public on ten days throughout the year corresponding to the ten days that the isaac hall of the cave of the patriarchs is open  in early      new mezuzot were affixed to the entrance of the site 






ahmed i

ahmed i         april             november       was the sultan of the ottoman empire from      until his death in       ahmed s reign is noteworthy for marking the end of the ottoman tradition of royal fratricide  henceforth ottoman rulers would no longer execute their brothers upon accession to the throne  he is also well known for his construction of the blue mosque  one of the most famous mosques in turkey 

ahmed was probably born in april      at the manisa palace  manisa  when his father   ehzade mehmed was still a prince and the governor of the sanjak of manisa  his mother was handan sultan  after his grandfather murad iii s death in       his father came to constantinople and ascended the throne as sultan mehmed iii  mehmed ordered the execution of nineteen of his own brothers and half brothers  ahmed s elder brother   ehzade mahmud was also executed by his father mehmed on   june       just before mehmed s own death on    december       mahmud was buried along with his mother in a separate mausoleum built by ahmed in   ehzade mosque  constantinople 

ahmed ascended the throne after his father s death in       at the age of thirteen  when his powerful grandmother safiye sultan was still alive  a far lost uncle of ahmed  yahya  resented his accession to the throne and spent his life scheming to become sultan  ahmed broke with the traditional fratricide following previous enthronements and did not order the execution of his brother mustafa  instead mustafa was sent to live at the old palace at bayezit along with their grandmother safiye sultan  this was most likely due to ahmed s young age   he had not yet demonstrated his ability to sire children  and mustafa was then the only other candidate for the ottoman throne  his brother s execution would have endangered the dynasty  and thus he was spared 

in the earlier part of his reign ahmed i showed decision and vigor  which were belied by his subsequent conduct  the wars in hungary and persia  which attended his accession  terminated unfavourably for the empire  its prestige was further tarnished in the treaty of zsitvatorok  signed in       whereby the annual tribute paid by austria was abolished  following the crushing defeat in the ottoman   safavid war             against the neighbouring rivals safavid empire  led by shah abbas the great  georgia  azerbaijan and other vast territories in the caucasus were ceded back to persia per the treaty of nasuh pasha in       territories that had been temporarily conquered in the ottoman   safavid war              the new borders were drawn per the same line as confirmed in the peace of amasya of      

the ottoman   safavid war had begun shortly before the death of ahmed s father mehmed iii  upon ascending the throne  ahmed i appointed cigalazade yusuf sinan pasha as the commander of the eastern army  the army marched from constantinople on    june       which was too late  and by the time it had arrived on the eastern front on   november       the safavid army had captured yerevan and entered the kars eyalet  and could only be stopped in akhaltsikhe  despite the conditions being favourable  sinan pasha decided to stay for the winter in van  but then marched to erzurum to stop an incoming safavid attack  this caused unrest within the army and the year was practically wasted for the ottomans 

in       sinan pasha marched to take tabriz  but the army was undermined by k  se sefer pasha  the beylerbey of erzurum  marching independently from sinan pasha and consequently being taken prisoner by the safavids  the ottoman army was routed at urmia and had to flee firstly to van and then to diyarbekir  here  sinan pasha sparked a rebellion by executing the beylerbey of aleppo  canbulato  lu h  seyin pasha  who had come to provide help  upon the pretext that he had arrived too late  he soon died himself and the safavid army was able to capture ganja  shirvan and shamakhi in azerbaijan 

the long turkish war between the ottomans and the habsburg monarchy had been going on for over a decade by the time ahmed ascended the throne  grand vizier malko   ali pasha marched to the western front from constantinople on   june      and arrived in belgrade  but died there  so lala mehmed pasha was appointed as the grand vizier and the commander of the western army  under mehmed pasha  the western army recaptured pest and v  c  but failed to capture esztergom as the siege was lifted due to unfavourable weather and the objections of the soldiers  meanwhile  the prince of transylvania  stephen bocskay  who struggled for the region s independence and had formerly supported the habsburgs  sent a messenger to the porte asking for help  upon the promise of help  his forces also joined the ottoman forces in belgrade  with this help  the ottoman army besieged esztergom and captured it on   november       bocskai  with ottoman help  captured nov   z  mky  uyvar  and forces under tiryaki hasan pasha took veszpr  m and palota  sarho     brahim pasha  the beylerbey of nagykanizsa  kanije   attacked the austrian region of istria 

however  with jelali revolts in anatolia more dangerous than ever and a defeat in the eastern front  mehmed pasha was called to constantinople  mehmed pasha suddenly died there  whilst preparing to leave for the east  kuyucu murad pasha then negotiated the peace of zsitvatorok  which abolished the tribute of        ducats paid by austria and addressed the habsburg emperor as the equal of the ottoman sultan  the jelali revolts were a strong factor in the ottomans  acceptance of the terms  this signaled the end of ottoman growth in europe 

resentment over the war with the habsburgs and heavy taxation  along with the weakness of the ottoman military response  combined to make the reign of ahmed i the zenith of the jelali revolts  tavil ahmed launched a revolt soon after the coronation of ahmed i and defeated nasuh pasha and the beylerbey of anatolia  kecdehan ali pasha  in       tavil ahmed was offered the position of the beylerbey of shahrizor to stop his rebellion  but soon afterwards he went on to capture harput  his son  mehmed  obtained the governorship of baghdad with a fake firman and defeated the forces of nasuh pasha sent to defeat him 

meanwhile  canbulato  lu ali pasha united his forces with the druze sheikh ma no  lu fahreddin to defeat the amir of tripoli seyfo  lu yusuf  he went on to take control of the adana area  forming an army and issuing coins  his forces routed the army of the newly appointed beylerbey of aleppo  h  seyin pasha  grand vizier bo  nak dervish mehmed pasha was executed for the weakness he showed against the jelalis  he was replaced by kuyucu murad pasha  who marched to syria with his forces to defeat the        strong rebel army with great difficulty  albeit with a decisive result  on    october       meanwhile  he pretended to forgive the rebels in anatolia and appointed the rebel kalendero  lu  who was active in manisa and bursa  as the sanjakbey of ankara  baghdad was recaptured in      as well  canbulato  lu ali pasha fled to constantinople and asked for forgiveness from ahmed i  who appointed him to timi  oara and later belgrade  but then executed him due to his misrule there  meanwhile  kalendero  lu was not allowed in the city by the people of ankara and rebelled again  only to be crushed by murad pasha s forces  kalendero  lu ended up fleeing to persia  murad pasha then suppressed some smaller revolts in central anatolia and suppressed other jelali chiefs by inviting them to join the army 

due to the widespread violence of the jelali revolts  a great number of people had fled their villages and a lot of villages were destroyed  some military chiefs had claimed these abandoned villages as their property  this deprived the porte of tax income and on    september       ahmed i issued a letter guaranteeing the rights of the villagers  he then worked on the resettlement of abandoned villages 

the new grand vizier  nasuh pasha  did not want to fight with the safavids  the safavid shah also sent a letter saying that he was willing to sign a peace  with which he would have to send     loads of silk every year to constantinople  on    november       the treaty of nasuh pasha was signed  which ceded all the lands the ottoman empire had gained in the war of           back to persia and reinstated the      boundaries 

however  the peace ended in      when the shah did not send the     loads of silk  on    may       grand vizier   k  z mehmed pasha was assigned to organize an attack on persia  mehmed pasha delayed the attack till the next year  until when the safavids made their preparations and attacked ganja  in april       mehmed pasha left aleppo with a large army and marched to yerevan  where he failed to take the city and withdrew to erzurum  he was removed from his post and replaced by damat halil pasha  halil pasha went for the winter to diyarbekir  while the khan of crimea  canibek giray  attacked the areas of ganja  nakhichevan and julfa 

ahmed i renewed trade treaties with england  france and venice  in july       the first ever trade treaty with the dutch republic was signed  he expanded the capitulations given to france  specifying that merchants from spain  ragusa  genoa  ancona and florence could trade under the french flag 

sultan ahmed constructed the sultan ahmed mosque  the magnum opus of the ottoman architecture  across from the hagia sophia  the sultan attended the breaking of the ground with a golden pickaxe to begin the construction of the mosque complex  an incident nearly broke out after the sultan discovered that the blue mosque contained the same number of minarets as the grand mosque of mecca  ahmed became furious at this fault and became remorseful until the shaykh ul islam recommended that he should erect another minaret at the grand mosque of mecca and the matter was solved 

ahmed became delightedly involved in the eleventh comprehensive renovations of the kaaba  which had just been damaged by flooding  he sent craftsmen from constantinople  and the golden rain gutter that kept rain from collecting on the roof of the ka   ba was successfully renewed  it was again during the era of sultan ahmed that an iron web was placed inside the zamzam well in mecca  the placement of this web about three feet below the water level was a response to lunatics who jumped into the well  imagining a promise of a heroic death 

in medina  the city of the prophet muhammad  a new pulpit made of white marble and shipped from istanbul arrived in the mosque of the prophet and substituted the old  worn out pulpit  it is also known that sultan ahmed erected two more mosques in uskudar on the asian side of istanbul  however  neither of them has survived 

the sultan had a crest carved with the footprint of muhammad that he would wear on fridays and festive days and illustrated one of the most significant examples of affection to the prophet in ottoman history  engraved inside the crest was a poem he composed 
sultan ahmed was known for his skills in fencing  poetry  horseback riding  and fluency in several languages 

ahmed was a poet who wrote a number of political and lyrical works under the name bahti  but while supportive of poetry  he displayed an aversion to artistry and continued his father s neglect of miniature painting  this was connected to a devout religiosity that declared depiction of living things in art an immoral rivalry to allah s creation  accordingly  ahmed patronized scholars  calligraphers  and pious men  hence he commissioned a book entitled  the quintessence of histories  to be worked upon by calligraphers  he also attempted to enforce conformance to islamic laws and traditions  restoring the old regulations that prohibited alcohol and he attempted to enforce attendance at friday prayers and paying alms to the poor in the proper way 

he was responsible for the destruction of the musical clock organ that elizabeth i of england sent to the court during the reign of his father  the reason for this may have been ahmed s religious objection to figurative art 

ahmed i died of typhus and gastric bleeding on    november      at the topkap   palace  istanbul  he was buried in ahmed i mausoleum  sultan ahmed mosque  he was succeeded by his younger brother   ehzade mustafa as sultan mustafa i  later three of ahmed s sons ascended to the throne  osman ii  r              murad iv  r             and ibrahim  r             




today  ahmed i is remembered mainly for the construction of the sultan ahmed mosque  also known as the blue mosque   one of the masterpieces of islamic architecture  the area in fatih around the mosque is today called sultanahmet  he died at topkap   palace in constantinople and is buried in a mausoleum right outside the walls of the famous mosque 

in the      tv series     ahmed i is portrayed by turkish actor ekin ko

ahmed ii

ahmed ii  ottoman turkish                     a   med i s  n         february            february       was the sultan of the ottoman empire from      to       ahmed ii was born at topkap   palace  constantinople  the son of sultan ibrahim             by muazzez sultan  and succeeded his brother suleiman ii             in      

ahmed ii was born on    february       the son of sultan ibrahim and muazzez sultan  during the reigns of his older brothers  ahmed was imprisoned in kafes  and he stayed there almost    years 

during his short reign  sultan ahmed ii devoted most of his attention to the wars against the habsburgs and related foreign policy  governmental and economic issues  of these  the most important were the tax reforms and the introduction of the lifelong tax farm system  malikane   see tax farming   following the recovery of belgrade under his predecessor  suleiman ii  the military frontier reached a rough stalemate on the danube  with the habsburgs no longer able to advance south of it  and the ottomans attempting  ultimately unsuccessfully  to regain the initiative north of it 

among the most important features of ahmed s reign was his reliance on k  pr  l  zade faz  l mustafa pasha  following his accession to the throne  sultan ahmed ii confirmed k  pr  l  zade faz  l mustafa pasha in his office as grand vizier  in office from       faz  l mustafa pasha was from the famous k  pr  l   family of grand viziers  and like most of his k  pr  l   predecessors in the same office  was an able administrator and military commander  like his father k  pr  l   mehmed pasha  grand vizier            before him  he ordered the removal and execution of dozens of corrupt state officials of the previous regime and replaced them with men loyal to himself  he overhauled the tax system by adjusting it to the capabilities of the taxpayers affected by the latest wars  he also reformed troop mobilization and increased the pool of conscripts available for the army by drafting tribesmen in the balkans and anatolia  in october      he recaptured belgrade  northern serbia   a key fortress that commanded the confluence of the rivers danube and sava  in ottoman hands since       the fortress had been conquered by the habsburgs in      

faz  l mustafa pasha s victory at belgrade was a major military achievement that gave the ottomans hope that the military debacles of the     s   which had led to the loss of hungary and transylvania  an ottoman vassal principality ruled by pro istanbul hungarian princes    could be reversed  however  the ottoman success proved ephemeral  on    august       faz  l mustafa pasha suffered a devastating defeat at the battle of slankamen  northwest of belgrade  at the hands of ludwig wilhelm von baden  the habsburg commander in chief in hungary  fittingly nicknamed    t  rkenlouis     louis the turk  for his victories against the ottomans  in the confrontation  recognized by contemporaries as    the bloodiest battle of the century     the ottomans suffered heavy losses         men  including the grand vizier  with him  the sultan lost his most capable military commander and the last member of the k  pr  l   family  who for the previous half century had been instrumental in strengthening the ottoman military 

under faz  l mustafa pasha s successors  the ottomans suffered further defeats  in june      the habsburgs conquered v  rad  oradea  romania   the seat of an ottoman governor    since       in      they attempted to recapture v  rad  but to no avail  on    january       they surrendered the fortress of gyula  the center of an ottoman sanjak or subprovince since       with the fall of gyula  the only territory still in ottoman hands in hungary was to the east of the river tisza and to the south of the river maros  with its center at temesv  r  three weeks later  on   february       ahmed ii died in edirne palace 








ahmed iii

ahmed iii  ottoman turkish                      a   med i s  lis          december       july       was sultan of the ottoman empire and a son of sultan mehmed iv  r              his mother was emetullah rabia g  lnu   sultan  originally named evmania voria  who was an ethnic greek  he was born at hac  o  lu pazarc  k  in dobruja  he succeeded to the throne in      on the abdication of his brother mustafa ii                nev  ehirli damat   brahim pasha and the sultan s daughter  fatma sultan  wife of the former  directed the government from      to       a period referred to as the  tulip era  

ahmed iii cultivated good relations with france  doubtless in view of russia s menacing attitude  he afforded refuge in ottoman territory to charles xii of sweden               after the swedish defeat at the hands of peter i of russia               in the battle of poltava of       in      charles xii convinced sultan ahmed iii to declare war against russia  and the ottoman forces under baltac   mehmet pasha won a major victory at the battle of prut  in the aftermath  russia returned azov back to the ottomans  agreed to demolish the fortress of taganrog and others in the area  and to stop interfering in the affairs of the polish   lithuanian commonwealth 

forced against his will into war with russia  ahmed iii came nearer than any ottoman sovereign before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival  whose armies his grand vizier nev  ehirli damat   brahim pasha succeeded in completely surrounding at the pruth river campaign in       the subsequent ottoman victories against russia enabled the ottoman empire to advance to moscow  had the sultan wished  however  this was halted as a report reached istanbul that the safavids were invading the ottoman empire  causing a period of panic  turning the sultan s attention away from russia 

sultan ahmed iii had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged  on september           a mutinous riot of seventeen janissaries  led by the albanian patrona halil  was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the sultan was forced to give up the throne 

ahmed voluntarily led his nephew mahmud i             to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as sultan of the empire  he then retired to the kafes previously occupied by mahmud and died at topkap   palace after six years of confinement 

ahmed iii s twenty seven year reign was successful  the recovery of azov and the morea  and the conquest of part of persia  managed to counterbalance the balkan territory ceded to the habsburg monarchy through the treaty of passarowitz  after the ottoman empire was defeated in austro turkish war of            in       he sent an army of        men to capture corfu from the republic of venice but that expedition eventually failed 

ahmed iii left the finances of the ottoman empire in a flourishing condition  which had remarkably been obtained without excessive taxation or extortion procedures  he was a cultivated patron of literature and art  and it was in his time that the first printing press authorized to use the arabic or turkish languages was set up in istanbul  operated by ibrahim muteferrika  while the printing press had been introduced to constantinople in       all works published before      were in greek  armenian  or hebrew  

it was in this reign that an important change in the government of the danubian principalities was introduced  previously  the porte had appointed hospodars  usually native moldavian and wallachian boyars  to administer those provinces  after the russian campaign of       during which peter the great found an ally in moldavia prince dimitrie cantemir  the porte began overtly deputizing phanariote greeks in that region  and extended the system to wallachia after prince stefan cantacuzino established links with eugene of savoy  the phanariotes constituted a kind of  dhimmi  nobility  which supplied the porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state 

in the year       the mughal emperor jahandar shah  a grandson of aurangzeb sent gifts to the ottoman sultan ahmad iii and referred to himself as the ottoman sultan s devoted admirer 

the mughal emperor farrukhsiyar a grandson of aurangzeb  is also known to have sent a letter to the ottomans but this time it was received by the grand vizier nev  ehirli damad ibrahim pasha providing a graphic description of the efforts of the mughal commander syed hassan ali khan barha against the rajput and maratha rebellion 




in voltaire s  candide   the eponymous main character meets the deposed ahmed iii on a ship from venice to constantinople  the sultan is in the company of five other deposed european monarchs  and he tells candide  who initially doubts his credentials 

i am not jesting  my name is achmet iii  for several years i was sultan  i dethroned my brother  my nephew dethroned me  they cut off the heads of my viziers  i am ending my days in the old seraglio  my nephew  sultan mahmoud  sometimes allows me to travel for my health  and i have come to spend the carnival at venice   

this episode was taken up by the modern turkish writer nedim g  rsel as the setting of his      novel  le voyage de candide    istanbul  

in fact  there is no evidence of the deposed sultan being allowed to make such foreign travels  nor did voltaire  or g  rsel  assert that it had any actual historical foundation

ainu people

the ainu or the aynu  ainu            aynu   japanese   ainu   russian   ajny    in the historical japanese texts the ezo     are an indigenous people of japan  hokkaido  and formerly northeastern honshu  and russia  sakhalin  the kuril islands  and formerly the kamchatka peninsula  

the official number of the ainu is         but unofficially is estimated at          due to many ainu having been completely assimilated into japanese society and  as a result  having no knowledge of their ancestry 

recent research suggests that ainu culture originated from a merger of the jomon  okhotsk and satsumon cultures  in       ainu invaded the land of nivkh people controlled by the yuan dynasty  resulting in battles between ainu and the chinese  active contact between the wajin  the ethnically japanese  and the ainu of ezochi  now known as hokkaido  began in the   th century  the ainu formed a society of hunter gatherers  surviving mainly by hunting and fishing  they followed a religion which was based on natural phenomena 

during the muromachi period                the disputes between the japanese and ainu developed into a war  takeda nobuhiro killed the ainu leader  koshamain  many ainu were subject to japanese rule which led to a violent ainu revolt such as koshamain s revolt    in      

during the edo period               the ainu  who controlled the northern island which is now named hokkaido  became increasingly involved in trade with the japanese who controlled the southern portion of the island  the tokugawa bakufu  feudal government  granted the matsumae clan exclusive rights to trade with the ainu in the northern part of the island  later  the matsumae began to lease out trading rights to japanese merchants  and contact between japanese and ainu became more extensive  throughout this period the ainu became increasingly dependent on goods imported by the japanese  and were suffering from epidemic diseases such as smallpox 
although the increased contact created by the trade between the japanese and the ainu contributed to increased mutual understanding  it also led to conflict which occasionally intensified into violent ainu revolts  the most important was shakushain s revolt                an ainu rebellion against japanese authority  another large scale revolt by ainu against japanese rule was the menashi kunashir battle in      

in the   th century  there were        ainu  in       there were about        ainu in hokkaido       in sakhalin and around     in the kuril islands 

the beginning of the meiji restoration in      proved a turning point for ainu culture  the japanese government introduced a variety of social  political  and economic reforms in hope of modernizing the country in the western style  one innovation involved the annexation of hokkaido  sj  berg quotes baba s        account of the japanese government s reasoning 

    the development of japan s large northern island had several objectives  first  it was seen as a means to defend japan from a rapidly developing and expansionist russia  second     it offered a solution to the unemployment for the former samurai class     finally  development promised to yield the needed natural resources for a growing capitalist economy 

in       the japanese government passed an act labelling the ainu as  former aborigines   with the idea they would assimilate   this resulted in the japanese government taking the land where the ainu people lived and placing it from then on under japanese control  also at this time  the ainu were granted automatic japanese citizenship  effectively denying them the status of an indigenous group 
the ainu were becoming increasingly marginalized on their own land   over a period of only    years  the ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land  language  religion and customs assimilated into those of the japanese  in addition to this  the land the ainu lived on was distributed to the wajin who had decided to move to hokkaido  encouraged by the japanese government of the meiji era to take advantage of the island s abundant natural resources  and to create and maintain farms in the model of western industrial agriculture  while at the time  the process was openly referred to as colonization   takushoku           the notion was later reframed by japanese elites to the currently common usage  kaitaku            which instead conveys a sense of opening up or reclamation of the ainu lands  as well as this  factories such as flour mills  beer breweries and mining practices resulted in the creation of infrastructure such as roads and railway lines  during a development period that lasted until       during this time  the ainu were forced to learn japanese  required to adopt japanese names  and ordered to cease religious practices such as animal sacrifice and the custom of tattooing 

the      act mentioned above was replaced in        until then the government had stated there were no ethnic minority groups  it was not until june          that japan formally recognised the ainu as an indigenous group  see official recognition  below  

the vast majority of these wajin men are believed to have compelled ainu women into partnering with them as local wives  intermarriage between japanese and ainu was actively promoted by the ainu to lessen the chances of discrimination against their offspring  as a result  many ainu are indistinguishable from their japanese neighbors  but some ainu japanese are interested in traditional ainu culture  for example  oki  born as a child of an ainu father and a japanese mother  became a musician who plays the traditional ainu instrument  tonkori   there are also many small towns in the southeastern or hidaka region where ethnic ainu live such as in nibutani  ainu   niputay    many live in sambutsu especially  on the eastern coast  in      the number of  pure  ainu was about     

their most widely known ethnonym is derived from the word  ainu   which means  human   particularly as opposed to  kamui   divine beings   basically neither ethnicity nor the name of a race  in the hokkaido dialects of the ainu language  ainu is the word ainu identify themselves as from their first male ancestor aioina  ainu also identify themselves as  utari    comrade  in the ainu language   official documents use both names 

on june          the japanese diet passed a bipartisan  non binding resolution calling upon the government to recognize the ainu people as indigenous to japan  and urging an end to discrimination against the group  the resolution recognised the ainu people as  an indigenous people with a distinct language  religion and culture   the government immediately followed with a statement acknowledging its recognition  stating   the government would like to solemnly accept the historical fact that many ainu were discriminated against and forced into poverty with the advancement of modernization  despite being legally equal to  japanese  people  

as a result of the treaty of saint petersburg         the kuril islands     along with their ainu inhabitants     came under japanese administration  a total of    north kuril ainu arrived in petropavlovsk kamchatsky on september           after they decided to remain under russian rule  they refused the offer by russian officials to move to new reservations in the commander islands  finally a deal was reached in      and the ainu decided to settle in the village of yavin  in march       the group left petropavlovsk and started the journey towards yavin on foot  four months later they arrived at their new homes  another village  golygino  was founded later  under soviet rule  both the villages were forced to disband and residents were moved to the russian dominated zaporozhye rural settlement in ust bolsheretsky raion  as a result of intermarriage  the three ethnic groups assimilated to form the kamchadal community  in       k  omelchenko  the minister for the protection of military and state secrets in the ussr  banned the press from publishing any more information on the ainu living in the ussr  this order was revoked after two decades 
  the north kuril ainu of zaporozhye form the largest ainu subgroup in russia  the nakamura clan  south kuril ainu on their paternal side   the smallest group  numbers just six people residing in petropavlovsk  on sakhalin island  a few dozen people identify themselves as sakhalin ainu  but many more with partial ainu ancestry do not acknowledge it  most of the     japanese people living in russia       census  are of mixed japanese ainu ancestry  although they do not acknowledge it  full japanese ancestry gives them the right of visa free entry to japan   similarly  no one identifies themselves as amur valley ainu  although people with partial descent live in khabarovsk  there is no evidence of living descendants of the kamchatka ainu 

in the      census of russia  close to     people tried to register themselves as ethnic ainu in the village  but the governing council of kamchatka krai rejected their claim and enrolled them as ethnic kamchadal  in       the leader of the ainu community in kamchatka  alexei vladimirovich nakamura  requested that vladimir ilyukhin  governor of kamchatka  and boris nevzorov  chairman of the state duma  include the ainu in the central list of the indigenous small numbered peoples of the north  siberia and the far east  this request was also turned down 

ethnic ainu living in sakhalin oblast and khabarovsk krai are not organized politically  according to alexei nakamura  only     ainu live in russia  up from just    people who self identified as ainu in       and they along with the kurile kamchadals  itelmen of kuril islands  are fighting for official recognition  since the ainu are not recognized in the official list of the peoples living in russia  they are counted as people without nationality or as ethnic russians or kamchadal 

the ainu have emphasized that they were the natives of the kuril islands and that the japanese and russians were both invaders  in       the small ainu community living in russia in kamchatka krai wrote a letter to vladimir putin  urging him to reconsider any move to award the southern kuril islands to japan  in the letter they blamed the japanese  the tsarist russians and the soviets for crimes against the ainu such as killings and assimilation  and also urged him to recognize the japanese genocide against the ainu people   which was turned down by putin 

the ainu have often been considered to descend from the j  mon people  who lived in japan from the j  mon period          to     bce   one of their  yukar upopo   or legends  tells that   t he ainu lived in this place a hundred thousand years before the children of the sun came  

recent research suggests that the historical ainu culture originated in a merger of the okhotsk culture with the satsumon  one of the ancient archaeological cultures that are considered to have derived from the j  mon period cultures of the japanese archipelago  the ainu economy was based on farming  as well as on hunting  fishing and gathering 

full blooded ainu  compared to people of yamato descent  often have lighter skin and more body hair  many early investigators proposed a caucasian ancestry  although recent dna tests have not shown any genetic similarity with modern europeans  luigi luca cavalli sforza places the ainu in his  northeast and east asian  genetic cluster 

anthropologist joseph powell of the university of new mexico wrote     we follow brace and hunt        and turner        in viewing the ainu as a southeast asian population derived from early jomon peoples of japan  who have their closest biological affinity with south asians rather than western eurasia peoples  

a autosomal dna research in      resulted in grouping the ainu and other j  mon remnants with northeastern asians 

mark j  hudson  professor of anthropology at nishikyushu university  kanzaki  saga  japan  has stated that japan was settled by a  proto mongoloid  population in the pleistocene who became the j  mon and that their features can be seen in the ainu and okinawan people 

in       anthropologist arnold henry savage landor described the ainu as having deep set eyes and an eye shape typical of europeans  with a large and prominent browridge  large ears  hairy and prone to baldness  slightly hook nose with large and broad nostrils  prominent cheek bones and a medium mouth 

omoto has also shown that the ainu are far more related to other east asian groups  previously mentioned as  mongoloid   than to any caucasian groups  on the basis of fingerprints and dental morphology 

a study based on cranial and genetic characteristics suggests an origin of the ainu in northern asia 

turner found remains of j  mon people of japan to belong to a pattern resembling the sundadont pattern which is typically found in southern mongoloid living populations of taiwanese aborigines  filipinos  vietnamese  indonesians  thais  borneans  laotians  and malaysians  a recreation of a map made by william w  howells  professor of anthropology at harvard university  shows in the shaded the remnants and populations of non mongoloid people  appearing as n  negrito  or a  australoids of wallacea  melanesia and australia   the latter peoples comprise the present aboriginals of australia and melanesia  as shown  the interest here is their presence and remnants  sundadonts comprise southeast asiatics and offshore peoples from northern japan  ainu  down to taiwan and indonesia  sinodonts comprise the east asian populations from korea  japan  china  mongolia and siberia  

ainu men have abundant wavy hair and often have long beards  the book of  ainu life and legends  by author ky  suke kindaichi  published by the japanese tourist board in       contains a physical description of ainu 
many have wavy hair  but some straight black hair  very few of them have wavy brownish hair  their skins are generally reported to be light brown  but this is due to the fact that they labor on the sea and in briny winds all day  old people who have long desisted from their outdoor work are often found to be as white as western men  the ainu have broad faces  beetling eyebrows  and large sunken eyes  which are generally horizontal and of the so called european type  eyes of the mongolian type are hardly found among them 

genetic testing has shown that the ainu belong mainly to y haplogroup d m    y dna haplogroup d b is found throughout the japanese archipelago  but with very high frequencies among the ainu of hokkaido in the far north  and to a lesser extent among the ryukyuans in the ryukyu islands of the far south  the only places outside japan in which y haplogroup d is common are tibet in china and the andaman islands in the indian ocean 
a study by tajima  et al          found two out of a sample of sixteen  or        ainu men to belong to haplogroup c m     which is the most common y chromosome haplogroup among the indigenous populations of siberia and mongolia  hammer  et al          tested a sample of four ainu men and found that one of them belonged to haplogroup c m     some researchers have speculated that this minority of haplogroup c m    carriers among the ainu may reflect a certain degree of unidirectional genetic influence from the nivkhs  a traditionally nomadic people of northern sakhalin and the adjacent mainland  with whom the ainu have long standing cultural interactions 

based on analysis of one sample of    modern ainus  their mtdna lineages consist mainly of haplogroup y                according to tanaka  et al         or               according to adachi  et al         who have cited tajima  et al          haplogroup d                particularly d  xd     haplogroup m a                 and haplogroup g                  other mtdna haplogroups detected in this sample include a         m b          n b         b f         f b         and m a         most of the remaining individuals in this sample have been classified definitively only as belonging to macro haplogroup m  according to sato  et al           who have studied the mtdna of the same sample of modern ainus  n      the major haplogroups of the ainu are n                  including       y and      n  xy    d                 including      d xd   and      d    m                   and g                 including      g  and      g    the minor haplogroups are a         b         f         and m xm   m   cz  d  g          studies published in      and      show the combined frequency of m a and n b were observed in jomons and which are believed by some to be jomon maternal contribution at     in okinawans       m a        m a xm a         n b         in ainus       m a xm a         n b   and from              m a xm a           m a           n b  to             m a         m a xm a    in mainstream japanese 

a recent reevaluation of cranial traits suggests that the ainu resemble the okhotsk more than they do the j  mon  this agrees with the references to the ainu as a merger of okhotsk and satsumon referenced above  a recent genetic study has revealed that the closest genetic relatives of the ainu are the ryukyuan people  followed by the yamato people and nivkh 

the first recruitment of ainu men into the japanese military occurred in       sixty four ainu served in the russo japanese war             eight of whom died in battle or from illness contracted during military service  two received the order of the golden kite  granted for bravery  leadership or command in battle 

during world war ii australian troops engaged in the hard fought kokoda track campaign  july   november       in new guinea were surprised by the physique and fighting prowess of the first japanese troops they encountered 

today  it is estimated that fewer than     speakers of the language remain  while other research places the number at fewer than    speakers  the language has been classified as  endangered   as a result of this the study of the ainu language is limited and is based largely on historical research 

although there have been attempts to show that the ainu language and the japanese language are related  modern scholars have rejected that the relationship goes beyond contact  such as the mutual borrowing of words between japanese and ainu  no attempt to show a relationship with ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance  and ainu is currently considered to be a language isolate 

words used as prepositions in english  such as  to    from    by    in   and  at   are postpositional in ainu  they come after the word that they modify  a single sentence in ainu can be made up of many added or agglutinated sounds or affixes that represent nouns or ideas 

the ainu language has had no system of writing  and has historically been transliterated by the japanese kana or russian cyrillic  today  it is typically written in either katakana or latin alphabet  the unwieldy nature of the japanese kana with its inability to accurately represent coda consonants has contributed to the degradation of the original ainu  for example  some words  such as  kor   meaning  to hold    are now pronounced with a paragoge  as in  koro  

many of the ainu dialects  even from one end of hokkaido to the other  were not mutually intelligible  however  the classic ainu language of the yukar  or ainu epic stories  was understood by all  without a writing system  the ainu were masters of narration  with the yukar and other forms of narration such as the uepeker  uwepeker  tales  being committed to memory and related at gatherings  often lasting many hours or even days 

traditional ainu culture was quite different from japanese culture  never shaving after a certain age  the men had full beards and moustaches  men and women alike cut their hair level with the shoulders at the sides of the head  trimmed semicircularly behind  the women tattooed their mouths  and sometimes the forearms  the mouth tattoos were started at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip  gradually increasing with size  the soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for colour  their traditional dress was a robe spun from the inner bark of the elm tree  called  attusi  or  attush   various styles were made  and consisted generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves  which was folded around the body  and tied with a band about the waist  the sleeves ended at the wrist or forearm and the length generally was to the calves  women also wore an undergarment of japanese cloth 

modern craftswomen weave and embroider traditional garments that command very high prices  in winter the skins of animals were worn  with leggings of deerskin and in sakhalin  boots were made from the skin of dogs or salmon  ainu culture considers earrings  traditionally made from grapevines  to be gender neutral  women also wear a beaded necklace called a tamasay 

their traditional cuisine consists of the flesh of bear  fox  wolf  badger  ox  or horse  as well as fish  fowl  millet  vegetables  herbs  and roots  they never ate raw fish or flesh  it was always boiled or roasted 

their traditional habitations were reed thatched huts  the largest square  without partitions and having a fireplace in the center  there was no chimney  only a hole at the angle of the roof  there was one window on the eastern side and there were two doors  the house of the village head was used as a public meeting place when one was needed  another kind of traditional ainu house was called  chise  

instead of using furniture  they sat on the floor  which was covered with two layers of mats  one of rush  the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves   iris pseudacorus    and for beds they spread planks  hanging mats around them on poles  and employing skins for coverlets  the men used chopsticks when eating  the women had wooden spoons  ainu cuisine is not commonly eaten outside ainu communities  there are only a few ainu run restaurants in japan  all located in tokyo or hokkaido  serving primarily japanese fare 

the functions of judgeship were not entrusted to chiefs  an indefinite number of a community s members sat in judgment upon its criminals  capital punishment did not exist  nor did the community resort to imprisonment  beating was considered a sufficient and final penalty  however  in the case of murder  the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the tendons of his feet severed 

the ainu hunted from late autumn to early summer  the reasons for this were  among others  that in late autumn  plant gathering  salmon fishing and other activities of securing food came to an end  and hunters readily found game in fields and mountains in which plants had withered 

a village possessed a hunting ground of its own or several villages used a joint hunting territory  iwor   heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or joint hunting territory 

the ainu hunted bear  ezo deer  a subspecies of sika deer   rabbit  fox  raccoon dog  and other animals  ezo deer were a particularly important food resource for the ainu  as were salmon  they also hunted sea eagles such as white tailed sea eagles  raven and other birds  the ainu hunted eagles to obtain their tail feathers  which they used in trade with the japanese 
the ainu hunted with arrows and spears with poison coated points  they obtained the poison  called  surku   from the roots and stalks of aconites  the recipe for this poison was a household secret that differed from family to family  they enhanced the poison with mixtures of roots and stalks of dog s bane  boiled juice of mekuragumo  matsumomushi  tobacco and other ingredients  they also used stingray stingers or skin covering stingers 

they hunted in groups with dogs  before the ainu went hunting  for animals like bear in particular  they prayed to the god of fire and the house guardian god to convey their wishes for a large catch  and safe hunting to the god of mountains 

the ainu usually hunted bear during the time of the spring thaw  at that time  bears were weak because they had not fed at all during long hibernation  ainu hunters caught hibernating bears or bears that had just left hibernation dens  when they hunted bear in summer  they used a spring trap loaded with an arrow  called an  amappo   the ainu usually used arrows to hunt deer  also  they drove deer into a river or sea and shot them with arrows  for a large catch  a whole village would drive a herd of deer off a cliff and club them to death 

men wore a crown called  sapanpe  for important ceremonies   sapanpe  was made from wood fibre with bundles of partially shaved wood  this crown had wooden figures of animal gods and other ornaments on its centre  men carried an  emush   ceremonial sword  secured by an  emush at  strap to their shoulders 

women wore  matanpushi   embroidered headbands  and  ninkari   earrings   ninkari  was a metal ring with a ball  women wore it through a hole in the ear   matanpushi  and  ninkari  were originally worn by men  however  women wear them now  furthermore  aprons called  maidari  now are a part of women s formal clothes  however  some old documents say that men wore  maidari   women sometimes wore a bracelet called  tekunkani  

women wore a necklace called  rektunpe   a long  narrow strip of cloth with metal plaques  they wore a necklace that reached the breast called a  tamasay  or  shitoki   usually made from glass balls  some glass balls came from trade with the asian continent  the ainu also obtained glass balls secretly made by the matsumae clan 

a village is called a  kotan  in the ainu language  kotan were located in river basins and seashores where food was readily available  particularly in the basins of rivers through which salmon went upstream  a village consisted basically of a paternal clan  the average number of families was four to seven  rarely reaching more than ten  in the early modern times  the ainu people were forced to labor at the fishing grounds of the japanese  ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the japanese could secure a labor force  when the japanese moved to other fishing grounds  ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them  as a result  the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds 

 cise  or  cisey   houses  in a kotan were made of cogon grasses  bamboo grass  barks  etc  the length lay east to west or parallel to a river  a house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom  the house had three windows  including the  rorun puyar   a window located on the side facing the entrance  at the east side   through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out  the ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it  a house had a fireplace near the entrance  the husband and wife sat on the fireplace s left side  called  shiso     children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace s right side  called  harkiso    the house had a platform for valuables called  iyoykir  behind the shiso  the ainu placed  sintoko   hokai  and  ikayop   quivers  there 

outbuildings included separate lavatories for men called  ashinru  and for women called  menokoru   a  pu   storehouse  for food  a  heper set   cage for young bear   and drying racks for fish and wild plants  an altar   nusasan   faced the east side of the house   rorunpuyar    the ainu held such ceremonies there as  iyomante   a ceremony to send the spirit of a bear to the gods 

the ainu people had various types of marriage  a child was promised in marriage by arrangement between his or her parents and the parents of his or her betrothed or by a go between  when the betrothed reached a marriageable age  they were told who their spouse was to be  there were also marriages based on mutual consent of both sexes  in some areas  when a daughter reached a marriageable age  her parents let her live in a small room called  tunpu  annexed to the southern wall of her house  the parents chose her spouse from men who visited her 

the age of marriage was    to    years of age for men and    to    years of age for women  who were tattooed  at these ages  both sexes were regarded as adults 

when a man proposed to a woman  he visited her house  ate half a full bowl of rice handed to him by her  and returned the rest to her  if the woman ate the rest  she accepted his proposal  if she did not and put it beside her  she rejected his proposal  when a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged  they exchanged gifts  he sent her a small engraved knife  a workbox  a spool  and other gifts  she sent him embroidered clothes  coverings for the back of the hand  leggings and other handmade clothes  according to some books  many  yomeiri  marriages  in which a bride went to the house of a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family  were conducted in the old days 

for a  yomeiri  marriage  a man and his father would bring betrothal gifts to the house of a woman  including a sword  a treasured sword  an ornamental quiver  a sword guard  and a woven basket   hokai    if the man and woman agreed to marry  the man and his father would bring her to their house or the man would stay at her house for a while and then bring her to his house  at the wedding ceremony  participants prayed to the god of fire  bride and bridegroom respectively ate half of the rice served in a bowl  and other participants were entertained 

the worn out fabric of old clothing was used for baby clothes because soft cloth was good for the skin of babies and worn out material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods  abhorrence of dirty things  before a baby was breast fed  he she was given a decoction of the endodermis of alder and the roots of butterburs to discharge impurities  children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five  even when they wore clothes  they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open  subsequently  they wore bark clothes without patterns  such as  attush   until coming of age 

newborn babies were named  ayay   a baby s crying    shipo    poyshi   small excrement   and  shion   old excrement   children were called by these  temporary  names until the ages of two to three  they were not given permanent names when they were born  their tentative names had a portion meaning  excrement  or  old things  to ward off the demon of ill health  some children were named based on their behaviour or habits  other children were named after impressive events or after parents  wishes for the future of the children  when children were named  they were never given the same names as others 

men wore loincloths and had their hair dressed properly for the first time at age          women were also considered adults at the age of          they wore underclothes called  mour  and had their hair dressed properly and wound waistcloths called  raunkut  and  ponkut  around their bodies  when women reached age          the lips  hands and arms were tattooed  when they reached age          their tattoos were completed  thus were they qualified for marriage 

the ainu are traditionally animists  believing that everything in nature has a  kamuy   spirit or god  on the inside  the most important include kamuy fuchi  goddess of the hearth  kim un kamuy  god of bears and mountains  and repun kamuy  god of the sea  fishing  and marine animals 

the ainu have no priests by profession  instead the village chief performs whatever religious ceremonies are necessary  ceremonies are confined to making libations of sake  saying prayers  and offering willow sticks with wooden shavings attached to them  these sticks are called  inaw   singular  and  nusa   plural  

they are placed on an altar used to  send back  the spirits of killed animals  ainu ceremonies for sending back bears are called  iyomante   the ainu people give thanks to the gods before eating and pray to the deity of fire in time of sickness  they believe their spirits are immortal  and that their spirits will be rewarded hereafter by ascending to  kamuy mosir   land of the gods  

the ainu are part of a larger collective of indigenous people who practice  arctolatry  or bear worship  the ainu believe the bear is very special because they think the bear is kim un kamuy s way of delivering the gift of bear hide and meat to humans 

john batchelor reported that the ainu view the world as being a spherical ocean on which float many islands  a view based on the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west  he wrote that they believe the world rests on the back of a large fish  which when it moves causes earthquakes 

ainu assimilated into mainstream japanese society have adopted buddhism and shinto  while some northern ainu are members of the russian orthodox church 

most hokkaido ainu and some other ainu are members of an umbrella group called the hokkaido utari association  it was originally controlled by the government to speed ainu assimilation and integration into the japanese nation state  it now is run exclusively by ainu and operates mostly independently of the government 

other key institutions include  the foundation for research and promotion of ainu culture  frpac    set up by the japanese government after enactment of the ainu culture law in       the hokkaido university center for ainu and indigenous studies established in       as well as museums and cultural centers  ainu people living in tokyo have also developed a vibrant political and cultural community 

on march           the sapporo district court decided a landmark case that  for the first time in japanese history  recognized the right of the ainu people to enjoy their distinct culture and traditions  the case arose because of a      government plan to build two dams in the saru river watershed in southern hokkaido  the dams were part of a series of development projects under the second national development plan that were intended to industrialize the north of japan  the planned location for one of the dams was across the valley floor close to nibutani village  the home of a large community of ainu people and an important center of ainu culture and history  in the early     s when the government commenced construction on the dam  two ainu landowners refused to agree to the expropriation of their land  these landowners were kaizawa tadashi and kayano shigeru   well known and important leaders in the ainu community  after kaizawa and kayano declined to sell their land  the hokkaido development bureau applied for and was subsequently granted a project authorization  which required the men to vacate their land  when their appeal of the authorization was denied  kayano and kaizawa s son koichii  kaizawa died in        filed suit against the hokkaido development bureau 

the final decision denied the relief sought by the plaintiffs for pragmatic reasons   the dam was already standing   but the decision was nonetheless heralded as a landmark victory for the ainu people  in short  nearly all of the plaintiffs  claims were recognized  moreover  the decision marked the first time japanese case law acknowledged the ainu as an indigenous people and contemplated the responsibility of the japanese nation to the indigenous people within its borders  the decision included broad fact finding that underscored the long history of the oppression of the ainu people by japan s majority  referred to as wajin in the case and discussions about the case  the legal roots of the decision can be found in article    of japan s constitution  which protects the rights of the individual  and in the international covenant on civil and political rights  the decision was issued on march           and because of the broad implications for ainu rights  the plaintiffs decided not to appeal the decision  which became final two weeks later  after the decision was issued  on may          the diet passed the ainu culture law and repealed the ainu protection act   the      law that had been the vehicle of ainu oppression for almost one hundred years  while the ainu culture law has been widely criticized for its shortcomings  the shift that it represents in japan s view of the ainu people is a testament to the importance of the nibutani decision  in      the  cultural landscape along the sarugawa river resulting from ainu tradition and modern settlement  was designated an important cultural landscape  a later action seeking restoration of ainu assets held in trust by the japanese government was dismissed in      

much national policy in japan has been developed out of the action of governmental advisory boards  known as in japanese  one such committee operated in the late     s  and its work resulted in the      ainu culture law  this panel s circumstances were criticized for including not even a single ainu person among its members 

more recently  a panel was established in       which notably was the first time an ainu person was included  it completed its work in      issuing a major report that included an extensive historical record and called for substantial government policy changes towards the ainu 

the was founded on january           after a group of ainu activists in hokkaido announced the formation of a political party for the ainu on october           the ainu association of hokkaido reported that kayano shiro  the son of the former ainu leader kayano shigeru  will head the party  their aim is to contribute to the realization of a multicultural and multiethnic society in japan  along with rights for the ainu 

the ainu have historically suffered from economic and social discrimination throughout japan that continues to this day  the japanese government as well as people since contact with the ainu  have in large part regarded them as a dirty  backwards and a primitive people  the majority of ainu were forced to be petty laborers during the meiji restoration  which saw the introduction of hokkaido into the japanese empire and the privatization of traditional ainu lands  the japanese government during the   th and   th centuries denied the rights of the ainu to their traditional cultural practices  most notably the right to speak their language  as well as their right to hunt and gather  these policies were designed to fully integrate the ainu into japanese society with the cost of erasing ainu culture and identity  the ainu s position as manual laborers and their forced integration into larger japanese society have led to discriminatory practices by the japanese government that can still be felt today  this discrimination and negative stereotypes assigned to the ainu have manifested in the ainu s lower levels of education  income levels and participation in the economy as compared to their ethnically japanese counterparts  the ainu community in hokkaido in      received welfare payments at a     times higher rate  had an      lower enrollment rate from junior high school to high school and a       lower enrollment into college from high school than that of hokkaido as a whole  the japanese government has been lobbied by activists to research the ainu s standard of living nationwide due to this noticeable and growing gap  the japanese government will provide     million beginning in       to conduct surveys nationwide on this matter 













acropolis

an acropolis  ancient greek                        akropolis   from  akros               or  akron                 highest  topmost  outermost  and  polis                 city   plural in english   acropoles    acropoleis  or  acropolises   was in ancient greece a settlement  especially a citadel  built upon an area of elevated ground   frequently a hill with precipitous sides  chosen for purposes of defense  acropoleis became the nuclei of large cities of classical antiquity  such as ancient athens  and for this reason they are sometimes prominent landmarks in modern cities with ancient pasts  such as modern athens 

the word  acropolis  literally means in greek  upper city   and though associated primarily with the greek cities athens  argos  with larissa   thebes  with cadmea   and corinth  with its acrocorinth   may be applied generically to all such citadels  including rome  jerusalem  celtic bratislava  many in asia minor  or even castle rock in edinburgh  an example in ireland is the rock of cashel  acropolis is also the term used by archaeologists and historians for the urban castro culture settlements located in northwestern iberian hilltops 

the most famous example is the acropolis of athens  which  by reason of its historical associations and the several famous buildings erected upon it  most notably the parthenon   is known without qualification as  the acropolis   although originating in the mainland of greece  use of the acropolis model quickly spread to greek colonies such as the dorian lato on crete during the archaic period 

because of its classical hellenistic style  the ruins of mission san juan capistrano s great stone church in california  united states has been called the  american acropolis  

other parts of the world developed other names for the high citadel or alc  zar  which often reinforced a naturally strong site  in central italy  many small rural communes still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as  la rocca  of the commune 

the term  acropolis  is also used to describe the central complex of overlapping structures  such as plazas and pyramids  in many maya cities  including tikal and cop  n 





acupuncture

acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the body  it is a key component of traditional chinese medicine  tcm   acupuncture is a pseudoscience as the theories and practices of tcm are not based upon scientific knowledge  there are a diverse range of acupuncture theories based on different philosophies  and techniques vary depending on the country in which it is performed  the method used in tcm is probably the most widespread in the united states  it is most often used for pain relief  though it is also used for a wide range of other conditions  acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment 
the conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent  which suggests that it is not effective  an overview of cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions  a systematic review found little evidence of acupuncture s effectiveness in treating pain  the evidence suggests that short term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long term benefits  some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain  though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture s effects are mainly due to the placebo effect  a systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias  a meta analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost effective as an adjunct to standard care  while a systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain 

acupuncture is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single use needles  when properly delivered  it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects  accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect on the part of the practitioner  a review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the previous decade  the most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections  since serious adverse events continue to be reported  it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk 
scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional chinese concepts such as  qi   meridians  and acupuncture points  and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy   qi   flowing through meridians  which was a major part of early belief systems  acupuncture is believed to have originated around      bc in china  around the time  the yellow emperor s classic of internal medicine   huangdi neijing  was published  though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier  over time  conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar  celestial and earthly cycles  yin and yang energies  and a body s  rhythm  on the effectiveness of treatment  acupuncture fluctuated in popularity in china during changes in the country s political leadership and the preferential use of rationalism or western medicine  acupuncture spread first to korea in the  th century ad  then to japan through medical missionaries  and then to europe  beginning with france  in the   th century  as it spread to the united states and western countries  spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflict with western beliefs were sometimes abandoned in favor of simply tapping needles into acupuncture points 

acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine  it is used most commonly for pain relief  though it is also used to treat a wide range of conditions  the majority of people who seek out acupuncture do so for musculoskeletal problems  including low back pain  shoulder stiffness  and knee pain  acupuncture is generally only used in combination with other forms of treatment  for example  american society of anesthesiologists states it may be considered in the treatment for nonspecific  noninflammatory low back pain only in conjunction with conventional therapy 

acupuncture is the insertion of thin needles into the skin  according to the mayo foundation for medical education and research  mayo clinic   a typical session entails lying still while approximately five to twenty needles are inserted  for the majority of cases  the needles will be left in place for ten to twenty minutes  it can be associated with the application of heat  pressure  or laser light  classically  acupuncture is individualized and based on philosophy and intuition  and not on scientific research  there is also a non invasive therapy developed in early   th century japan using an elaborate set of  needles  for the treatment of children   sh  nishin  or  sh  nihari   

clinical practice varies depending on the country  a comparison of the average number of patients treated per hour found significant differences between china      and the united states        chinese herbs are often used  there is a diverse range of acupuncture approaches  involving different philosophies  although various different techniques of acupuncture practice have emerged  the method used in traditional chinese medicine  tcm  seems to be the most widely adopted in the us  traditional acupuncture involves needle insertion  moxibustion  and cupping therapy  and may be accompanied by other procedures such as feeling the pulse and other parts of the body and examining the tongue  traditional acupuncture involves the belief that a  life force    qi   circulates within the body in lines called meridians  the main methods practiced in the uk are tcm and western medical acupuncture  the term western medical acupuncture is used to indicate an adaptation of tcm based acupuncture which focuses less on tcm  the western medical acupuncture approach involves using acupuncture after a medical diagnosis  limited research has compared the contrasting acupuncture systems used in various countries for determining different acupuncture points and thus there is no defined standard for acupuncture points 

in traditional acupuncture  the acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition used  in tcm  the four diagnostic methods are  inspection  auscultation and olfaction  inquiring  and palpation  inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue  including analysis of the tongue size  shape  tension  color and coating  and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge  auscultation and olfaction involve listening for particular sounds such as wheezing  and observing body odor  inquiring involves focusing on the  seven inquiries   chills and fever  perspiration  appetite  thirst and taste  defecation and urination  pain  sleep  and menses and leukorrhea  palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender   a shi   points and feeling the pulse 

the most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles  which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation  electroacupuncture   acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel  making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking  needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination  reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications  needles vary in length between   with shorter needles used near the face and eyes  and longer needles in areas with thicker tissues  needle diameters vary from   to    with thicker needles used on more robust patients  thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion  the tip of the needle should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage  although blunt needles cause more pain 

apart from the usual filiform needle  other needle types include three edged needles and the nine ancient needles  japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially  sometimes without penetrating the skin  and surrounded by a guide tube  a   th century invention adopted in china and the west   korean acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand 

the skin is sterilized and needles are inserted  frequently with a plastic guide tube  needles may be manipulated in various ways  including spinning  flicking  or moving up and down relative to the skin  since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin  a quick insertion of the needle is recommended  often the needles are stimulated by hand in order to cause a dull  localized  aching sensation that is called  de qi   as well as  needle grasp   a tugging feeling felt by the acupuncturist and generated by a mechanical interaction between the needle and skin  acupuncture can be painful  the skill level of the acupuncturist may influence how painful the needle insertion is  and a sufficiently skilled practitioner may be able to insert the needles without causing any pain 

 de qi      arrival of qi   refers to a sensation of numbness  distension  or electrical tingling at the needling site which might radiate along the corresponding meridian  if  de qi  can not be generated  then inaccurate location of the acupoint  improper depth of needle insertion  inadequate manual manipulation  or a very weak constitution of the patient can be considered  all of which are thought to decrease the likelihood of successful treatment  if the  de qi  sensation does not immediately occur upon needle insertion  various manual manipulation techniques can be applied to promote it  such as  plucking    shaking  or  trembling   

once  de qi  is achieved  further techniques might be utilized which aim to  influence  the  de qi   for example  by certain manipulation the  de qi  sensation allegedly can be conducted from the needling site towards more distant sites of the body  other techniques aim at  tonifying     or  sedating      qi   the former techniques are used in deficiency patterns  the latter in excess patterns   de qi  is more important in chinese acupuncture  while western and japanese patients may not consider it a necessary part of the treatment 

acupuncture has been researched extensively  as of       there were almost       randomized controlled trials on pubmed with  acupuncture  in the title  the results of reviews of reviews of acupuncture s effectiveness  however  have been inconclusive 

it is difficult but not impossible to design rigorous research trials for acupuncture  due to acupuncture s invasive nature  one of the major challenges in efficacy research is in the design of an appropriate placebo control group  for efficacy studies to determine whether acupuncture has specific effects   sham  forms of acupuncture where the patient  practitioner  and analyst are blinded seem the most acceptable approach  sham acupuncture uses non penetrating needles or needling at non acupuncture points  e g  inserting needles on meridians not related to the specific condition being studied  or in places not associated with meridians  the under performance of acupuncture in such trials may indicate that therapeutic effects are due entirely to non specific effects  or that the sham treatments are not inert  or that systematic protocols yield less than optimal treatment 

a      review in  nature reviews cancer  found that  contrary to the claimed mechanism of redirecting the flow of  qi  through meridians  researchers usually find that it generally does not matter where the needles are inserted  how often  that is  no dose response effect is observed   or even if needles are actually inserted  in other words   sham  or  placebo  acupuncture generally produces the same effects as  real  acupuncture and  in some cases  does better   a      meta analysis found little evidence that the effectiveness of acupuncture on pain  compared to sham  was modified by the location of the needles  the number of needles used  the experience or technique of the practitioner  or by the circumstances of the sessions  the same analysis also suggested that the number of needles and sessions is important  as greater numbers improved the outcomes of acupuncture compared to non acupuncture controls  there has been little systematic investigation of which components of an acupuncture session may be important for any therapeutic effect  including needle placement and depth  type and intensity of stimulation  and number of needles used  the research seems to suggest that needles do not need to stimulate the traditionally specified acupuncture points or penetrate the skin to attain an anticipated effect  e g  psychosocial factors  

a response to  sham  acupuncture in osteoarthritis may be used in the elderly  but placebos have usually been regarded as deception and thus unethical  however  some physicians and ethicists have suggested circumstances for applicable uses for placebos such as it might present a theoretical advantage of an inexpensive treatment without adverse reactions or interactions with drugs or other medications  as the evidence for most types of alternative medicine such as acupuncture is far from strong  the use of alternative medicine in regular healthcare can present an ethical question 

using the principles of evidence based medicine to research acupuncture is controversial  and has produced different results  some research suggests acupuncture can alleviate pain but the majority of research suggests that acupuncture s effects are mainly due to placebo  evidence suggests that any benefits of acupuncture are short lasting  there is insufficient evidence to support use of acupuncture compared to mainstream medical treatments  acupuncture is not better than mainstream treatment in the long term 

the use of acupuncture has been criticized owing to there being little scientific evidence for explicit effects  or the mechanisms for its supposed effectiveness  for any condition that is discernible from placebo  acupuncture has been called  theatrical placebo   and david gorski argues that when acupuncture proponents advocate  harnessing of placebo effects  or work on developing  meaningful placebos   they essentially concede it is little more than that 

publication bias is cited as a concern in the reviews of randomized controlled trials  rcts  of acupuncture  a      review of studies on acupuncture found that trials originating in china  japan  hong kong  and taiwan were uniformly favourable to acupuncture  as were ten out of eleven studies conducted in russia  a      assessment of the quality of rcts on tcm  including acupuncture  concluded that the methodological quality of most such trials  including randomization  experimental control  and blinding  was generally poor  particularly for trials published in chinese journals  though the quality of acupuncture trials was better than the trials testing tcm remedies   the study also found that trials published in non chinese journals tended to be of higher quality  chinese authors use more chinese studies  which have been demonstrated to be uniformly positive  a      review of    systematic reviews of acupuncture published in chinese journals found that less than half of these reviews reported testing for publication bias  and that the majority of these reviews were published in journals with impact factors of zero  a      study comparing pre registered records of acupuncture trials with their published results found that it was uncommon for such trials to be registered before the trial began  this study also found that selective reporting of results and changing outcome measures to obtain statistically significant results was common in this literature 

scientist and journalist steven salzberg identifies acupuncture and chinese medicine generally as a focus for  fake medical journals  such as the  journal of acupuncture and meridian studies  and  acupuncture in medicine  

the conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent with each other  a      systematic review of systematic reviews found that for reducing pain  real acupuncture was no better than sham acupuncture  and concluded that numerous reviews have shown little convincing evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for reducing pain  the same review found that neck pain was one of only four types of pain for which a positive effect was suggested  but cautioned that the primary studies used carried a considerable risk of bias  a      overview of cochrane reviews found acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions 

a      systematic review suggests that the nocebo effect of acupuncture is clinically relevant and that the rate of adverse events may be a gauge of the nocebo effect  according to the       miller s anesthesia  book   when compared with placebo  acupuncture treatment has proven efficacy for relieving pain   a      meta analysis conducted by the acupuncture trialists  collaboration found  relatively modest  efficiency of acupuncture  in comparison to sham  for the treatment of four different types of chronic pain  back and neck pain  knee osteoarthritis  chronic headache  and shoulder pain  and on that basis concluded that it  is more than a placebo  and a reasonable referral option  commenting on this meta analysis  both edzard ernst and david colquhoun said the results were of negligible clinical significance  edzard ernst later stated that  i fear that  once we manage to eliminate this bias  that operators are not blind      we might find that the effects of acupuncture exclusively are a placebo response   in       the same research group updated their previous meta analysis and again found acupuncture to be superior to sham acupuncture for non specific musculoskeletal pain  osteoarthritis  chronic headache  and shoulder pain  they also found that the effects of acupuncture decreased by about     after one year 

a      systematic review suggested that acupuncture is more than a placebo for commonly occurring chronic pain conditions  but the authors acknowledged that it is still unknown if the overall benefit is clinically meaningful or cost effective  a      review found real acupuncture and sham acupuncture produce similar improvements  which can only be accepted as evidence against the efficacy of acupuncture  the same review found limited evidence that real acupuncture and sham acupuncture appear to produce biological differences despite similar effects  a      systematic review and meta analysis found that acupuncture had a small analgesic effect  which appeared to lack any clinical importance and could not be discerned from bias  the same review found that it remains unclear whether acupuncture reduces pain independent of a psychological impact of the needling ritual  a      systematic review and meta analysis found that ear acupuncture may be effective at reducing pain within    hours of its use  but the mean difference between the acupuncture and control groups was small 

a      systematic review found that acupuncture may be effective for nonspecific lower back pain  but the authors noted there were limitations in the studies examined  such as heterogeneity in study characteristics and low methodological quality in many studies  a      systematic review found some supporting evidence that acupuncture was more effective than no treatment for chronic non specific low back pain  the evidence was conflicting comparing the effectiveness over other treatment approaches  a      systematic review of systematic reviews found that  for chronic low back pain  individualized acupuncture is not better in reducing symptoms than formula acupuncture or sham acupuncture with a toothpick that does not penetrate the skin   a      review found that sham acupuncture was as effective as real acupuncture for chronic low back pain  the specific therapeutic effects of acupuncture were small  whereas its clinically relevant benefits were mostly due to contextual and psychosocial circumstances  brain imaging studies have shown that traditional acupuncture and sham acupuncture differ in their effect on limbic structures  while at the same time showed equivalent analgesic effects  a      cochrane review found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against either acupuncture or dry needling for acute low back pain  the same review found low quality evidence for pain relief and improvement compared to no treatment or sham therapy for chronic low back pain only in the short term immediately after treatment  the same review also found that acupuncture is not more effective than conventional therapy and other alternative medicine treatments  a      systematic review and meta analysis concluded that  for neck pain  acupuncture was comparable in effectiveness to conventional treatment  while electroacupuncture was even more effective in reducing pain than was conventional acupuncture  the same review noted that  it is difficult to draw conclusion  sic  because the included studies have a high risk of bias and imprecision   a      overview of systematic reviews of variable quality showed that acupuncture can provide short term improvements to people with chronic low back pain  the overview said this was true when acupuncture was used either in isolation or in addition to conventional therapy  a      systematic review for an american college of physicians clinical practice guideline found low to moderate evidence that acupuncture was effective for chronic low back pain  and limited evidence that it was effective for acute low back pain  the same review found that the strength of the evidence for both conditions was low to moderate  another      clinical practice guideline  this one produced by the danish health authority  recommended against acupuncture for both recent onset low back pain and lumbar radiculopathy 

two separate      cochrane reviews found that acupuncture could be useful in the prophylaxis of tension type headaches and episodic migraines  the      cochrane review evaluating acupuncture for episodic migraine prevention concluded that true acupuncture had a small effect beyond sham acupuncture and found moderate quality evidence to suggest that acupuncture is at least similarly effective to prophylactic medications for this purpose  a      review found that acupuncture has demonstrated benefit for the treatment of headaches  but that safety needed to be more fully documented in order to make any strong recommendations in support of its use 

a      review concluded that  current evidence supports the use of acupuncture as an alternative to traditional analgesics in osteoarthritis patients     a meta analysis showed that acupuncture may help osteoarthritis pain but it was noted that the effects were insignificant in comparison to sham needles  a      systematic review and network meta analysis found that the evidence suggests that acupuncture may be considered one of the more effective physical treatments for alleviating pain due to knee osteoarthritis in the short term compared to other relevant physical treatments  though much of the evidence in the topic is of poor quality and there is uncertainty about the efficacy of many of the treatments  a      review found  the potential beneficial action of acupuncture on osteoarthritis pain does not appear to be clinically relevant   a      cochrane review found that acupuncture shows statistically significant benefit over sham acupuncture in the treatment of peripheral joint osteoarthritis  however  these benefits were found to be so small that their clinical significance was doubtful  and  probably due at least partially to placebo effects from incomplete blinding  

a      cochrane review found low to moderate evidence that acupuncture improves pain and stiffness in treating people with fibromyalgia compared with no treatment and standard care  a      review found  there is insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture for the treatment of fibromyalgia   a      systematic review found a small pain relief effect that was not apparently discernible from bias  acupuncture is not a recommendable treatment for the management of fibromyalgia on the basis of this review 

a      review found that the effectiveness of acupuncture to treat rheumatoid arthritis is  sparse and inconclusive   a      cochrane review concluded that acupuncture use to treat rheumatoid arthritis  has no effect on esr  crp  pain  patient s global assessment  number of swollen joints  number of tender joints  general health  disease activity and reduction of analgesics   a      overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture in the treatment of most rheumatic conditions  with the exceptions of osteoarthritis  low back pain  and lateral elbow pain 

a      systematic review found that although manual acupuncture was effective at relieving short term pain when used to treat tennis elbow  its long term effect in relieving pain was  unremarkable   a      review found that acupuncture was significantly better than sham acupuncture at treating chronic knee pain  the evidence was not conclusive due to the lack of large  high quality trials  a      cochrane review concluded that there is not enough evidence to determine if acupuncture is effective as a method to treat shoulder pain 

a      overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting  ponv  in a clinical setting  a      systematic review concluded that acupuncture might be beneficial in prevention and treatment of ponv  a      cochrane review found moderate quality evidence of no difference between stimulation of the p  acupoint on the wrist and antiemetic drugs for preventing ponv  a new finding of the review was that further comparative trials are futile  based on the conclusions of a trial sequential analysis  whether combining pc  acupoint stimulation with antiemetics is effective was inconclusive 

a      overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to suggest that acupuncture is effective for surgical or post operative pain  for the use of acupuncture for post operative pain  there was contradictory evidence  a      systematic review found supportive but limited evidence for use of acupuncture for acute post operative pain after back surgery  a      systematic review found that while the evidence suggested acupuncture could be an effective treatment for postoperative gastroparesis  a firm conclusion could not be reached because the trials examined were of low quality 

a      cochrane review found that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether acupuncture is an effective treatment for cancer pain in adults  a      systematic review published in the chinese journal of integrative medicine found that acupuncture may be effective as an adjunctive treatment to palliative care for cancer patients  a      overview of reviews published in the journal of multinational association for supportive care in cancer found evidence that acupuncture could be beneficial for people with cancer related symptoms  but also identified few rigorous trials and high heterogeneity between trials  a      systematic review of randomised clinical trials published in the same journal found that the number and quality of rcts for using acupuncture in the treatment of cancer pain was too low to draw definite conclusions 

a      systematic review reached inconclusive results with regard to the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating cancer related fatigue  a      systematic review found that acupuncture is an acceptable adjunctive treatment for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  but that further research with a low risk of bias is needed  a      systematic review found that the quantity and quality of available rcts for analysis were too low to draw valid conclusions for the effectiveness of acupuncture for cancer related fatigue 

a      systematic review and meta analysis found that acupuncture was  associated with a significant reduction in sleep disturbances in women experiencing menopause related sleep disturbances  

for the following conditions  the cochrane collaboration or other reviews have concluded there is no strong evidence of benefit 

a      overview of systematic reviews found that moxibustion was effective for several conditions but the primary studies were of poor quality  so there persists ample uncertainty  which limits the conclusiveness of their findings 

acupuncture is generally safe when administered by an experienced  appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and sterile single use needles  when improperly delivered it can cause adverse effects  accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect on the part of the practitioner  to reduce the risk of serious adverse events after acupuncture  acupuncturists should be trained sufficiently  people with serious spinal disease  such as cancer or infection  are not good candidates for acupuncture  contraindications to acupuncture  conditions that should not be treated with acupuncture  include coagulopathy disorders  e g  hemophilia and advanced liver disease   warfarin use  severe psychiatric disorders  e g  psychosis   and skin infections or skin trauma  e g  burns   further  electroacupuncture should be avoided at the spot of implanted electrical devices  such as pacemakers  

a      systematic review of systematic reviews  internationally and without language restrictions  found that serious complications following acupuncture continue to be reported  between      and       ninety five cases of serious adverse events  including five deaths  were reported  many such events are not inherent to acupuncture but are due to malpractice of acupuncturists  this might be why such complications have not been reported in surveys of adequately trained acupuncturists  most such reports originate from asia  which may reflect the large number of treatments performed there or a relatively higher number of poorly trained asian acupuncturists  many serious adverse events were reported from developed countries  these included australia  austria  canada  croatia  france  germany  ireland  the netherlands  new zealand  spain  sweden  switzerland  the uk  and the us  the number of adverse effects reported from the uk appears particularly unusual  which may indicate less under reporting in the uk than other countries  reports included    cases of infections and    cases of organ trauma  the most frequent adverse events included pneumothorax  and bacterial and viral infections 

a      review found  without restrictions regarding publication date  study type or language      cases of infections  mycobacterium was the pathogen in at least      likely sources of infection include towels  hot packs or boiling tank water  and reusing reprocessed needles  possible sources of infection include contaminated needles  reusing personal needles  a person s skin containing mycobacterium  and reusing needles at various sites in the same person  although acupuncture is generally considered a safe procedure  a      review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade  including those of mycobacterium  although it is recommended that practitioners of acupuncture use disposable needles  the reuse of sterilized needles is still permitted  it is also recommended that thorough control practices for preventing infection be implemented and adapted 

a      systematic review of the english language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare  but that acupuncture is not without risk  between      and      the english language literature from    countries and regions reported     adverse events  the majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor  and the incidences were low  for example  a prospective survey of        acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and    minor ones  a rate of     per      interventions  another survey found there were      minor adverse events  of which   were serious  amid        acupuncture patients  the most common adverse effect observed was infection  e g  mycobacterium   and the majority of infections were bacterial in nature  caused by skin contact at the needling site  infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting  other adverse complications included five reported cases of spinal cord injuries  e g  migrating broken needles or needling too deeply   four brain injuries  four peripheral nerve injuries  five heart injuries  seven other organ and tissue injuries  bilateral hand edema  epithelioid granuloma  pseudolymphoma  argyria  pustules  pancytopenia  and scarring due to hot needle technique  adverse reactions from acupuncture  which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice  included syncope  galactorrhoea  bilateral nystagmus  pyoderma gangrenosum  hepatotoxicity  eruptive lichen planus  and spontaneous needle migration 

a      systematic review found    cases of vascular injuries caused by acupuncture  three resulting in death  two died from pericardial tamponade and one was from an aortoduodenal fistula  the same review found vascular injuries were rare  bleeding and pseudoaneurysm were most prevalent  a      systematic review  without restriction in time or language   aiming to summarize all reported case of cardiac tamponade after acupuncture  found    cases resulting in    deaths  with little doubt about causality in most fatal instances  the same review concluded cardiac tamponade was a serious  usually fatal  though theoretically avoidable complication following acupuncture  and urged training to minimize risk 

a      review found a number of adverse events were reported after acupuncture in the uk s national health service  nhs  but most       were not severe  though miscategorization and under reporting may alter the total figures  from january      to december           safety incidents were recognized within the nhs organizations  the adverse events recorded included retained needles        dizziness        loss of consciousness unresponsive        falls       bruising or soreness at needle site       pneumothorax      and other adverse side effects        acupuncture practitioners should know  and be prepared to be responsible for  any substantial harm from treatments  some acupuncture proponents argue that the long history of acupuncture suggests it is safe  however  there is an increasing literature on adverse events  e g  spinal cord injury  

acupuncture seems to be safe in people getting anticoagulants  assuming needles are used at the correct location and depth  studies are required to verify these findings  the evidence suggests that acupuncture might be a safe option for people with allergic rhinitis 

a      systematic review of the chinese language literature found numerous acupuncture related adverse events  including pneumothorax  fainting  subarachnoid hemorrhage  and infection as the most frequent  and cardiovascular injuries  subarachnoid hemorrhage  pneumothorax  and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious  most of which were due to improper technique  between      and       the chinese language literature reported     adverse events  prospective surveys show that mild  transient acupuncture associated adverse events ranged from       to      in a study with         patients  the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly         another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of             incidences among         patients  infections  mainly hepatitis  after acupuncture are reported often in english language research  though are rarely reported in chinese language research  making it plausible that acupuncture associated infections have been underreported in china  infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles  other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma  in the cervical  thoracic and lumbar spine   chylothorax  injuries of abdominal organs and tissues  injuries in the neck region  injuries to the eyes  including orbital hemorrhage  traumatic cataract  injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture  hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis  peripheral motor nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction  local allergic reactions to metal needles  stroke  and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture 

a causal link between acupuncture and the adverse events cardiac arrest  pyknolepsy  shock  fever  cough  thirst  aphonia  leg numbness  and sexual dysfunction remains uncertain  the same review concluded that acupuncture can be considered inherently safe when practiced by properly trained practitioners  but the review also stated there is a need to find effective strategies to minimize the health risks  between      and       the republic of korean literature contained reports of      adverse events  between the     s and       the japanese language literature contained reports of     adverse events 

although acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years in china  its use in pediatrics in the united states did not become common until the early     s  in       the national health interview survey  nhis  conducted by the national center for health statistics  nchs  estimated that approximately         children had received acupuncture treatment for a variety of conditions 

in      a study determined that the use of acupuncture needle treatment on children was  questionable  due to the possibility of adverse side effects and the pain manifestation differences in children versus adults  the study also includes warnings against practicing acupuncture on infants  as well as on children who are over fatigued  very weak  or have over eaten 

when used on children  acupuncture is considered safe when administered by well trained  licensed practitioners using sterile needles  however  a      review found there was limited research to draw definite conclusions about the overall safety of pediatric acupuncture  the same review found     adverse events     of them serious  the adverse events were mostly mild in nature  e g  bruising or bleeding   the prevalence of mild adverse events ranged from       to        an estimated     incidences among       patients  on rare occasions adverse events were serious  e g  cardiac rupture or hemoptysis   many might have been a result of substandard practice  the incidence of serious adverse events was   per one million  which included children and adults 

when used during pregnancy  the majority of adverse events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient  with few serious adverse events  the most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain  followed by bleeding  although two deaths  one stillbirth and one neonatal death  were reported  there was a lack of acupuncture associated maternal mortality  limiting the evidence as certain  probable or possible in the causality evaluation  the estimated incidence of adverse events following acupuncture in pregnant women was     per        
although acupuncture is not contraindicated in pregnant women  some specific acupuncture points are particularly sensitive to needle insertion  these spots  as well as the abdominal region  should be avoided during pregnancy 

four adverse events associated with moxibustion were bruising  burns and cellulitis  spinal epidural abscess  and large superficial basal cell carcinoma  ten adverse events were associated with cupping  the minor ones were keloid scarring  burns  and bullae  the serious ones were acquired hemophilia a  stroke following cupping on the back and neck  factitious panniculitis  reversible cardiac hypertrophy  and iron deficiency anemia 

a      meta analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost effective as a complement to standard care  but not as a substitute for standard care except in cases where comorbid depression presented  the same meta analysis found there was no difference between sham and non sham acupuncture  a      systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain  a      systematic review found that the cost effectiveness of acupuncture could not be concluded  a      review found that acupuncture seems to be cost effective for some pain conditions 

as with other alternative medicines  unethical or na  ve practitioners may induce patients to exhaust financial resources by pursuing ineffective treatment  professional ethics codes set by accrediting organizations such as the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine require practitioners to make  timely referrals to other health care professionals as may be appropriate   stephen barrett states that there is a  risk that an acupuncturist whose approach to diagnosis is not based on scientific concepts will fail to diagnose a dangerous condition  

acupuncture is a substantial part of traditional chinese medicine  tcm   early acupuncture beliefs relied on concepts that are common in tcm  such as a life force energy called  qi    qi  was believed to flow from the body s primary organs  zang fu organs  to the  superficial  body tissues of the skin  muscles  tendons  bones  and joints  through channels called meridians  acupuncture points where needles are inserted are mainly  but not always  found at locations along the meridians  acupuncture points not found along a meridian are called extraordinary points and those with no designated site are called  a shi  points 

in tcm  disease is generally perceived as a disharmony or imbalance in energies such as yin  yang   qi   xu    z  ng f    meridians  and of the interaction between the body and the environment  therapy is based on which  pattern of disharmony  can be identified  for example  some diseases are believed to be caused by meridians being invaded with an excess of wind  cold  and damp  in order to determine which pattern is at hand  practitioners examine things like the color and shape of the tongue  the relative strength of pulse points  the smell of the breath  the quality of breathing  or the sound of the voice  tcm and its concept of disease does not strongly differentiate between the cause and effect of symptoms 

scientific research has not supported the existence of  qi   meridians  or yin and yang  a  nature  editorial described tcm as  fraught with pseudoscience   with the majority of its treatments having no logical mechanism of action  quackwatch states that  tcm theory and practice are not based upon the body of knowledge related to health  disease  and health care that has been widely accepted by the scientific community  tcm practitioners disagree among themselves about how to diagnose patients and which treatments should go with which diagnoses  even if they could agree  the tcm theories are so nebulous that no amount of scientific study will enable tcm to offer rational care  

some modern practitioners support the use of acupuncture to treat pain  but have abandoned the use of  qi   meridians   yin    yang  and other energies based in mysticism as explanatory frameworks  the use of  qi  as an explanatory framework has been decreasing in china  even as it becomes more prominent during discussions of acupuncture in the us  academic discussions of acupuncture still make reference to pseudoscientific concepts such as  qi  and meridians despite the lack of scientific evidence  many within the scientific community consider attempts to rationalize acupuncture in science to be quackery  pseudoscience and  theatrical placebo   academics massimo pigliucci and maarten boudry describe it as a  borderlands science  lying between science and pseudoscience 

many acupuncturists attribute pain relief to the release of endorphins when needles penetrate  but no longer support the idea that acupuncture can affect a disease  it is a generally held belief within the acupuncture community that acupuncture points and meridians structures are special conduits for electrical signals  but no research has established any consistent anatomical structure or function for either acupuncture points or meridians  human tests to determine whether electrical continuity was significantly different near meridians than other places in the body have been inconclusive 

some studies suggest acupuncture causes a series of events within the central nervous system  and that it is possible to inhibit acupuncture s analgesic effects with the opioid antagonist naloxone  mechanical deformation of the skin by acupuncture needles appears to result in the release of adenosine  the anti nociceptive effect of acupuncture may be mediated by the adenosine a  receptor  a      review in  nature reviews cancer  found that since the key mouse studies that suggested acupuncture relieves pain via the local release of adenosine  which then triggered nearby a  receptors  caused more tissue damage and inflammation relative to the size of the animal in mice than in humans  such studies unnecessarily muddled a finding that local inflammation can result in the local release of adenosine with analgesic effect  

it has been proposed that acupuncture s effects in gastrointestinal disorders may relate to its effects on the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system  which have been said to be the  western medicine  equivalent of  yin and yang   another mechanism whereby acupuncture may be effective for gastrointestinal dysfunction involves the promotion of gastric peristalsis in subjects with low initial gastric motility  and suppressing peristalsis in subjects with active initial motility  acupuncture has also been found to exert anti inflammatory effects  which may be mediated by the activation of the vagus nerve and deactivation of inflammatory macrophages  neuroimaging studies suggest that acupuncture stimulation results in deactivation of the limbic brain areas and the default mode network 

acupuncture  along with moxibustion  is one of the oldest practices of traditional chinese medicine  most historians believe the practice began in china  though there are some conflicting narratives on when it originated  academics david ramey and paul buell said the exact date acupuncture was founded depends on the extent dating of ancient texts can be trusted and the interpretation of what constitutes acupuncture 

according to an article in  rheumatology   the first documentation of an  organized system of diagnosis and treatment  for acupuncture was in  the yellow emperor s classic of internal medicine   huangdi neijing  from about      bc  gold and silver needles found in the tomb of liu sheng from around      bc are believed to be the earliest archeological evidence of acupuncture  though it is unclear if that was their purpose  according to plinio prioreschi  the earliest known historical record of acupuncture is the shih chi   record of history    written by a historian around      bc  it is believed that this text was documenting what was established practice at that time 

the       year old mummified body of   tzi the iceman was found with    groups of tattoos  many of which were located at points on the body where acupuncture needles are used for abdominal or lower back problems  evidence from the body suggests otzi suffered from these conditions  this has been cited as evidence that practices similar to acupuncture may have been practiced elsewhere in eurasia during the early bronze age  however   the oxford handbook of the history of medicine  calls this theory  speculative   it is considered unlikely that acupuncture was practiced before       bc  the   tzi the iceman s tattoo marks suggest to some experts that an acupuncture like treatment was previously used in europe   millennia ago 

acupuncture may have been practiced during the neolithic era  near the end of the stone age  using sharpened stones called bian shi  many chinese texts from later eras refer to sharp stones called  plen   which means  stone probe   that may have been used for acupuncture purposes  the ancient chinese medical text  huangdi neijing  indicates that sharp stones were believed at the time to cure illnesses at or near the body s surface  perhaps because of the short depth a stone could penetrate  however  it is more likely that stones were used for other medical purposes  such as puncturing a growth to drain its pus  the  mawangdui  texts  which are believed to be from the  nd century bc  mention the use of pointed stones to open abscesses  and moxibustion  but not for acupuncture  it is also speculated that these stones may have been used for bloodletting  due to the ancient chinese belief that illnesses were caused by demons within the body that could be killed or released  it is likely bloodletting was an antecedent to acupuncture 

according to historians lu gwei djen and joseph needham  there is substantial evidence that acupuncture may have begun around      bc  some hieroglyphs and pictographs from that era suggests acupuncture and moxibustion were practiced  however  historians gwei djen and needham said it was unlikely a needle could be made out of the materials available in china during this time period  it is possible that bronze was used for early acupuncture needles  tin  copper  gold and silver are also possibilities  though they are considered less likely  or to have been used in fewer cases  if acupuncture was practiced during the shang dynasty       to       bc   organic materials like thorns  sharpened bones  or bamboo may have been used  once methods for producing steel were discovered  it would replace all other materials  since it could be used to create a very fine  but sturdy needles  gwei djen and needham noted that all the ancient materials that could have been used for acupuncture and which often produce archeological evidence  such as sharpened bones  bamboo or stones  were also used for other purposes  an article in  rheumatology  said that the absence of any mention of acupuncture in documents found in the tomb of ma wang dui from      bc suggest that acupuncture was not practiced by that time 

several different and sometimes conflicting belief systems emerged regarding acupuncture  this may have been the result of competing schools of thought  some ancient texts referred to using acupuncture to cause bleeding  while others mixed the ideas of blood letting and spiritual ch i energy  over time  the focus shifted from blood to the concept of puncturing specific points on the body  and eventually to balancing yin and yang energies as well  according to david ramey  no single  method or theory  was ever predominantly adopted as the standard  at the time  scientific knowledge of medicine was not yet developed  especially because in china dissection of the deceased was forbidden  preventing the development of basic anatomical knowledge 

it is not certain when specific acupuncture points were introduced  but the autobiography of pien chhio from around            bc references inserting needles at designated areas  bian que believed there was a single acupuncture point at the top of one s skull that he called the point  of the hundred meetings   texts dated to be from            bc document early beliefs in channels of life force energy called meridians that would later be an element in early acupuncture beliefs 

ramey and buell said the  practice and theoretical underpinnings  of modern acupuncture were introduced in  the yellow emperor s classic   huangdi neijing  around      bc  it introduced the concept of using acupuncture to manipulate the flow of life energy   qi   in a network of meridian  channels  in the body  the network concept was made up of acu tracts  such as a line down the arms  where it said acupoints were located  some of the sites acupuncturists use needles at today still have the same names as those given to them by the  yellow emperor s classic   numerous additional documents were published over the centuries introducing new acupoints  by the  th century ad  most of the acupuncture sites in use today had been named and identified 

in the first half of the  st century ad  acupuncturists began promoting the belief that acupuncture s effectiveness was influenced by the time of day or night  the lunar cycle  and the season  the science of the yin yang cycles   y  n chhi hs  eh   was a set of beliefs that curing diseases relied on the alignment of both heavenly  thien  and earthly  ti  forces that were attuned to cycles like that of the sun and moon  there were several different belief systems that relied on a number of celestial and earthly bodies or elements that rotated and only became aligned at certain times  according to needham and gwei djen  these  arbitrary predictions  were depicted by acupuncturists in complex charts and through a set of special terminology 

acupuncture needles during this period were much thicker than most modern ones and often resulted in infection  infection is caused by a lack of sterilization  but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle  or needling in the wrong place  or at the wrong time  later  many needles were heated in boiling water  or in a flame  sometimes needles were used while they were still hot  creating a cauterizing effect at the injection site  nine needles were recommended in the  chen chiu ta chheng  from       which may have been because of an ancient chinese belief that nine was a magic number 

other belief systems were based on the idea that the human body operated on a rhythm and acupuncture had to be applied at the right point in the rhythm to be effective  in some cases a lack of balance between yin and yang were believed to be the cause of disease 

in the  st century ad  many of the first books about acupuncture were published and recognized acupuncturist experts began to emerge  the  zhen jiu jia yi jing   which was published in the mid  rd century  became the oldest acupuncture book that is still in existence in the modern era  other books like the  yu kuei chen ching   written by the director of medical services for china  were also influential during this period  but were not preserved  in the mid  th century  sun simiao published acupuncture related diagrams and charts that established standardized methods for finding acupuncture sites on people of different sizes and categorized acupuncture sites in a set of modules 

acupuncture became more established in china as improvements in paper led to the publication of more acupuncture books  the imperial medical service and the imperial medical college  which both supported acupuncture  became more established and created medical colleges in every province  the public was also exposed to stories about royal figures being cured of their diseases by prominent acupuncturists  by time  the great compendium of acupuncture and moxibustion  was published during the ming dynasty               ad   most of the acupuncture practices used in the modern era had been established 

by the end of the song dynasty        ad   acupuncture had lost much of its status in china  it became rarer in the following centuries  and was associated with less prestigious professions like alchemy  shamanism  midwifery and moxibustion  additionally  by the   th century  scientific rationality was becoming more popular than traditional superstitious beliefs  by      a book documenting the history of chinese medicine called acupuncture a  lost art   its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications  as well as its association with the lower classes 

in       the chinese emperor signed a decree excluding the practice of acupuncture from the imperial medical institute  he said it was unfit for practice by gentlemen scholars  in china acupuncture was increasingly associated with lower class  illiterate practitioners  it was restored for a time  but banned again in      in favor of science based western medicine  although acupuncture declined in china during this time period  it was also growing in popularity in other countries 

korea is believed to be the first country in asia that acupuncture spread to outside of china  within korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by emperor dangun  though it is more likely to have been brought into korea from a chinese colonial prefecture in      ad  acupuncture use was commonplace in korea by the  th century  it spread to vietnam in the  th and  th centuries  as vietnam began trading with japan and china around the  th century  it was influenced by their acupuncture practices as well  china and korea sent  medical missionaries  that spread traditional chinese medicine to japan  starting around      ad  in      several korean and chinese citizens were appointed to re organize medical education in japan and they incorporated acupuncture as part of that system  japan later sent students back to china and established acupuncture as one of five divisions of the chinese state medical administration system 

acupuncture began to spread to europe in the second half of the   th century  around this time the surgeon general of the dutch east india company met japanese and chinese acupuncture practitioners and later encouraged europeans to further investigate it  he published the first in depth description of acupuncture for the european audience and created the term  acupuncture  in his      work  de acupunctura   france was an early adopter among the west due to the influence of jesuit missionaries  who brought the practice to french clinics in the   th century  the french doctor louis berlioz  the father of the composer hector berlioz  is usually credited with being the first to experiment with the procedure in europe in       before publishing his findings in      

by the   th century  acupuncture had become commonplace in many areas of the world  americans and britons began showing interest in acupuncture in the early   th century but interest waned by mid century  western practitioners abandoned acupuncture s traditional beliefs in spiritual energy  pulse diagnosis  and the cycles of the moon  sun or the body s rhythm  diagrams of the flow of spiritual energy  for example  conflicted with the west s own anatomical diagrams  it adopted a new set of ideas for acupuncture based on tapping needles into nerves  in europe it was speculated that acupuncture may allow or prevent the flow of electricity in the body  as electrical pulses were found to make a frog s leg twitch after death 

the west eventually created a belief system based on travell trigger points that were believed to inhibit pain  they were in the same locations as china s spiritually identified acupuncture points  but under a different nomenclature  the first elaborate western treatise on acupuncture was published in      by willem ten rhijne 

in china  the popularity of acupuncture rebounded in      when mao zedong took power and sought to unite china behind traditional cultural values  it was also during this time that many eastern medical practices were consolidated under the name traditional chinese medicine  tcm  

new practices were adopted in the   th century  such as using a cluster of needles  electrified needles  or leaving needles inserted for up to a week  a lot of emphasis developed on using acupuncture on the ear  acupuncture research organizations were founded in the     s and acupuncture services became available in modern hospitals  china  where acupuncture was believed to have originated  was increasingly influenced by western medicine  meanwhile  acupuncture grew in popularity in the us  the us congress created the office of alternative medicine in      and the national institutes of health  nih  declared support for acupuncture for some conditions in november       in       the national center for complementary and alternative medicine was created within the nih  acupuncture became the most popular alternative medicine in the us 

politicians from the chinese communist party said acupuncture was superstitious and conflicted with the party s commitment to science  communist party chairman mao zedong later reversed this position  arguing that the practice was based on scientific principles 

in       a  new york times  reporter published an article on his acupuncture experiences in china  which led to more investigation of and support for acupuncture  the us president richard nixon visited china in       during one part of the visit  the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake  ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than anesthesia  later it was found that the patients selected for the surgery had both a high pain tolerance and received heavy indoctrination before the operation  these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving morphine surreptitiously through an intravenous drip that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients  one patient receiving open heart surgery while awake was ultimately found to have received a combination of three powerful sedatives as well as large injections of a local anesthetic into the wound  after the national institute of health expressed support for acupuncture for a limited number of conditions  adoption in the us grew further  in      the first legal acupuncture center in the us was established in washington dc and in      the american internal revenue service allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense 

in       a bbc documentary  alternative medicine  filmed a patient undergoing open heart surgery allegedly under acupuncture induced anesthesia  it was later revealed that the patient had been given a cocktail of anesthetics 

in       unesco inscribed  acupuncture and moxibustion of traditional chinese medicine  on the unesco intangible cultural heritage list following china s nomination 

acupuncture is popular in china  the us  australia  and europe including all five nordic countries  though less so in finland  it is most heavily practiced in china and is one of the most common alternative medicine practices in europe  in switzerland  acupuncture has become the most frequently used alternative medicine since       in the united kingdom  a total of   million acupuncture treatments were administered in       acupuncture is used in most pain clinics and hospices in the uk  an estimated   in    adults in australia used acupuncture in       in japan  it is estimated that    percent of the population will try acupuncture at some point  though in most cases it is not covered by public health insurance  users of acupuncture in japan are more likely to be elderly and to have a limited education  approximately half of users surveyed indicated a likelihood to seek such remedies in the future  while     did not  less than one percent of the us population reported having used acupuncture in the early     s  by the early     s  more than    million americans reported having used acupuncture as part of their health care 

in the us  acupuncture is increasingly    used at academic medical centers  and is usually offered through cam centers or anesthesia and pain management services  examples include those at harvard university  stanford university  johns hopkins university  and ucla  the american academy of family physicians recommends acupuncture for chronic pain  

the use of acupuncture in germany increased by     in       after the german acupuncture trials supported its efficacy for certain uses  in       there were more than one million users  and insurance companies have estimated that two thirds of german users are women  as a result of the trials  german public health insurers began to cover acupuncture for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis of the knee  but not tension headache or migraine  this decision was based in part on socio political reasons  some insurers in germany chose to stop reimbursement of acupuncture because of the trials  for other conditions  insurers in germany were not convinced that acupuncture had adequate benefits over usual care or sham treatments  highlighting the results of the placebo group  researchers refused to accept a placebo therapy as efficient 

there are various government and trade association regulatory bodies for acupuncture in the united kingdom  the united states  saudi arabia  australia  japan  canada  and in european countries and elsewhere  the world health organization recommends that before being licensed or certified  an acupuncturist receive     hours of specialized training if they are a physician and       hours for non physicians  many governments have adopted similar standards 

in china  the practice of acupuncture is regulated by the chinese medicine council that was formed in      by the legislative council  it includes a licensing exam and registration  as well as degree courses approved by the board  canada has acupuncture licensing programs in the provinces of british columbia  ontario  alberta and quebec  standards set by the chinese medicine and acupuncture association of canada are used in provinces without government regulation  regulation in the us began in the     s in california  which was eventually followed by every state but wyoming and idaho  licensing requirements vary greatly from state to state  the needles used in acupuncture are regulated in the us by the food and drug administration  in some states acupuncture is regulated by a board of medical examiners  while in others by the board of licensing  health or education 

in japan  acupuncturists are licensed by the minister of health  labour and welfare after passing an examination and graduating from a technical school or university  australia regulates chinese medical traditions through the chinese medicine board of australia and the public health  skin penetration  regulation of       it restricts the use of words like  acupuncture  and  registered acupuncturist   at least    countries in europe have professional associations for acupuncturists  in france  the acad  mie nationale de m  decine  national academy of medicine  has regulated acupuncture since

aeneas

in greco roman mythology  aeneas    greek                    aine  as   possibly derived from greek meaning  praised   was a trojan hero  the son of the prince anchises and the goddess aphrodite  venus   his father was a first cousin of king priam of troy  both being grandsons of ilus  founder of troy   making aeneas a second cousin to priam s children  such as hector and paris   he is a character in greek mythology and is mentioned in homer s  iliad   aeneas receives full treatment in roman mythology  most extensively in virgil s  aeneid   where he is cast as an ancestor of romulus and remus  he became the first true hero of rome  snorri sturluson identifies him with the norse   sir vidarr 

aeneas is the latin spelling of greek                   aine  as    in the homeric hymn to aphrodite  aeneas is first introduced with aphrodite naming him                   aine  as   for the                         terrible grief   he caused her  where  aine  as  derives from the adjective               ainon   meaning  terrible    it is a popular etymology for the name  apparently exploited by homer in the iliad  later in the medieval period there were writers who held that  because the aeneid was written by a philosopher it is meant to be read philosophically  as such  in the  natural order   the meaning of aeneas  name combines greek  ennos    dweller   and  demas    body    which becomes  ennaios   meaning  in dweller   i e  as a god inhabiting a mortal body   however  there is no certainty regarding the origin of his name 

in imitation of the  iliad   virgil borrows epithets of homer  including  anchisiades   magnanimum    magnus    heros   and  bonus   though he borrows many  virgil gives aeneas two epithets of his own in the  aeneid    pater  and  pius   the epithets applied by virgil are an example of an attitude different from that of homer  for whilst odysseus is  poikilios    wily    aeneas is described as  pius    pious    which conveys a strong moral tone  the purpose of these epithets seems to enforce the notion of aeneas  divine hand as father and founder of the roman race  and their use seem circumstantial  when aeneas is praying he refers to himself as pius  and is referred to as such by the author only when the character is acting on behalf of the gods to fulfill his divine mission  likewise  aeneas is called  pater  when acting in the interest of his men 

the story of the birth of aeneas is told in the  hymn to aphrodite   one of the major homeric hymns  aphrodite has caused zeus to fall in love with mortal women  in retaliation  zeus puts desire in her heart for anchises  who is tending his cattle among the hills near mount ida  when aphrodite sees him she is smitten  she adorns herself as if for a wedding among the gods and appears before him  he is overcome by her beauty  believing that she is a goddess  but aphrodite identifies herself as a phrygian princess  after they make love  aphrodite reveals her true identity to him and anchises fears what might happen to him as a result of their liaison  aphrodite assures him that he will be protected  and tells him that she will bear him a son to be called aeneas  however  she warns him that he must never tell anyone that he has lain with a goddess  when aeneas is born  aphrodite takes him to the nymphs of mount ida  she directs them to raise the child to age five  then take him to anchises  according to other sources  anchises later brags about his encounter with aphrodite  and as a result is struck in the foot with a thunderbolt by zeus  thereafter he is lame in that foot  so that aeneas has to carry him from the flames of troy 

aeneas is a minor character in the  iliad   where he is twice saved from death by the gods as if for an as yet unknown destiny  but is an honorable warrior in his own right  having held back from the fighting  aggrieved with priam because in spite of his brave deeds he was not given his due share of honour  he leads an attack against idomeneus to recover the body of his brother in law alcathous at the urging of deiphobus  he is the leader of the trojans  dardanian allies  as well as a second cousin and principal lieutenant of hector  son of the trojan king priam  aeneas s mother aphrodite frequently comes to his aid on the battlefield  and he is a favorite of apollo  aphrodite and apollo rescue aeneas from combat with diomedes of argos  who nearly kills him  and carry him away to pergamos for healing  even poseidon  who normally favors the greeks  comes to aeneas s rescue after he falls under the assault of achilles  noting that aeneas  though from a junior branch of the royal family  is destined to become king of the trojan people  bruce louden presents aeneas as a  type  in the tradition of utnapishtim  baucis and philemon  and lot  the just man spared the general destruction  apollodorus explains that     the greeks let him alone on account of his piety  

the roman mythographer gaius julius hyginus  c     bce     ce     in his  fabulae  credits aeneas with killing    enemies in the trojan war  aeneas also appears in the trojan narratives attributed to dares phrygius and dictys of crete

the history of aeneas was continued by roman authors  one influential source was the account of rome s founding in cato the elder s  origines   the aeneas legend was well known in virgil s day and appeared in various historical works  including the  roman antiquities  of the greek historian dionysius of halicarnassus  relying on marcus terentius varro    ab urbe condita  by livy  probably dependent on quintus fabius pictor  fl      bce   and gnaeus pompeius trogus  now extant only in an epitome by justin  

the  aeneid  explains that aeneas is one of the few trojans who were not killed or enslaved when troy fell  aeneas  after being commanded by the gods to flee  gathered a group  collectively known as the aeneads  who then traveled to italy and became progenitors of romans  the aeneads included aeneas s trumpeter misenus  his father anchises  his friends achates  sergestus  and acmon  the healer iapyx  the helmsman palinurus  and his son ascanius  also known as iulus  julus  or ascanius julius   he carried with him the lares and penates  the statues of the household gods of troy  and transplanted them to italy 

several attempts to find a new home failed  one such stop was on sicily  where in drepanum  on the island s western coast  his father  anchises  died peacefully 

after a brief but fierce storm sent up against the group at juno s request  aeneas and his fleet made landfall at carthage after six years of wanderings  aeneas had a year long affair with the carthaginian queen dido  also known as elissa   who proposed that the trojans settle in her land and that she and aeneas reign jointly over their peoples  a marriage of sorts was arranged between dido and aeneas at the instigation of juno  who was told that her favorite city would eventually be defeated by the trojans  descendants  aeneas s mother venus  the roman adaptation of aphrodite  realized that her son and his company needed a temporary respite to reinforce themselves for the journey to come  however  the messenger god mercury was sent by jupiter and venus to remind aeneas of his journey and his purpose  compelling him to leave secretly  when dido learned of this  she uttered a curse that would forever pit carthage against rome  an enmity that would culminate in the punic wars  she then committed suicide by stabbing herself with the same sword she gave aeneas when they first met 

after the sojourn in carthage  the trojans returned to sicily where aeneas organized funeral games to honor his father  who had died a year before  the company traveled on and landed on the western coast of italy  aeneas descended into the underworld where he met dido  who turned away from him to return to her husband  and his father  who showed him the future of his descendants and thus the history of rome 

latinus  king of the latins  welcomed aeneas s army of exiled trojans and let them reorganize their lives in latium  his daughter lavinia had been promised to turnus  king of the rutuli  but latinus received a prophecy that lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land     namely  aeneas  latinus heeded the prophecy  and turnus consequently declared war on aeneas at the urging of juno  who was aligned with king mezentius of the etruscans and queen amata of the latins  aeneas s forces prevailed  turnus was killed  and virgil s account ends abruptly 

the rest of aeneas s biography is gleaned from other ancient sources  including livy and ovid s  metamorphoses   according to livy  aeneas was victorious but latinus died in the war  aeneas founded the city of lavinium  named after his wife  he later welcomed dido s sister  anna perenna  who then committed suicide after learning of lavinia s jealousy  after aeneas s death  venus asked jupiter to make her son immortal  jupiter agreed  the river god numicus cleansed aeneas of all his mortal parts and venus anointed him with ambrosia and nectar  making him a god  aeneas was recognized as the god jupiter indiges 

snorri sturlason in the prologue of the edda  tells of the world as parted in three continents  africa  asia and the third part called europe or enea   snorri also tells of a trojan named munon or menon  who marries the daughter of the high king  yfirkonungr  priam called troan and travels to distant lands  marries the sybil and got a son  tror  who  as snorri tells  is identical to thor  this tale resemble some episodes of the aeneid   
continuations of trojan matter in the middle ages had their effects on the character of aeneas as well  the   th century french  roman d en  as  addresses aeneas s sexuality  though virgil appears to deflect all homoeroticism onto nisus and euryalus  making his aeneas a purely heterosexual character  in the middle ages there was at least a suspicion of homoeroticism in aeneas  the  roman d en  as  addresses that charge  when queen amata opposes aeneas s marrying lavinia  claiming that aeneas loved boys 

medieval interpretations of aeneas were greatly influenced by both virgil and other latin sources  specifically  the accounts by dares and dictys  which were reworked by   th century italian writer guido delle colonne  in  historia destructionis troiae    colored many later readings  from guido  for instance  the pearl poet and other english writers get the suggestion that aeneas s safe departure from troy with his possessions and family was a reward for treason  for which he was chastised by hecuba  in  sir gawain and the green knight   late   th century  the pearl poet  like many other english writers  employed aeneas to establish a genealogy for the foundation of britain  and explains that aeneas was  impeached for his perfidy  proven most true   line    

aeneas had an extensive family tree  his wet nurse was caieta  and he is the father of ascanius with creusa  and of silvius with lavinia  ascanius  also known as iulus  or julius   founded alba longa and was the first in a long series of kings  according to the mythology outlined by virgil in the  aeneid   romulus and remus were both descendants of aeneas through their mother rhea silvia  making aeneas the progenitor of the roman people  some early sources call him their father or grandfather  but considering the commonly accepted dates of the fall of troy       bc  and the founding of rome      bc   this seems unlikely  the julian family of rome  most notably julius c  sar and augustus  traced their lineage to ascanius and aeneas  thus to the goddess venus  through the julians  the palemonids make this claim  the legendary kings of britain     including king arthur     trace their family through a grandson of aeneas  brutus 

aeneas s consistent epithet in virgil and other latin authors is  pius   a term that connotes reverence toward the gods and familial dutifulness 

in the  aeneid   aeneas is described as strong and handsome  but neither his hair colour nor complexion are described  in late antiquity however sources add further physical descriptions  the  de excidio troiae  of dares phrygius describes aeneas as       auburn haired  stocky  eloquent  courteous  prudent  pious  and charming        there is also a brief physical description found in  th century ad john malalas   chronographia         aeneas  short  fat  with a good chest  powerful  with a ruddy complexion  a broad face  a good nose  fair skin  bald on the forehead  a good beard  grey eyes       

aeneas and dido are the main characters of a   th century broadside ballad called  the wandering prince of troy   the ballad ultimately alters aeneas s fate from traveling on years after dido s death to joining her as a spirit soon after her suicide 

in modern literature  aeneas is the speaker in two poems by allen tate   aeneas at washington  and  aeneas at new york   he is a main character in ursula k  le guin s  lavinia   a re telling of the last six books of the  aeneid  told from the point of view of lavinia  daughter of king latinus of latium 

aeneas appears in david gemmell s  troy  series as a main heroic character who goes by the name helikaon 

in rick riordan s book series   the heroes of olympus   aeneas is regarded as the first roman demigod  son of venus rather than aphrodite 

aeneas is a title character in henry purcell s opera  dido and aeneas   c         and one of the principal roles in hector berlioz  opera  les troyens   c         canadian composer james rolfe composed his opera  aeneas and dido         to a libretto by andr   alexis  as a companion piece to purcell s opera 

despite its many dramatic elements  aeneas s story has generated little interest from the film industry  portrayed by steve reeves  he was the main character in the      sword and sandal film  guerra di troia    the trojan war    reeves reprised the role the following year in the film  the avenger   about aeneas s arrival in latium and his conflicts with local tribes as he tries to settle his fellow trojan refugees there 

the most recent cinematic portrayal of aeneas was in the film  troy   in which he appears as a youth charged by paris to protect the trojan refugees  and to continue the ideals of the city and its people  paris gives aeneas priam s sword  in order to give legitimacy and continuity to the royal line of troy     and lay the foundations of roman culture  in this film  he is not a member of the royal family and does not appear to fight in the war 

in the role playing game    by white wolf game studios  aeneas figures as one of the mythical founders of the ventrue clan 

in the action game     aeneas is a playable character  the game ends with him and the aeneans fleeing troy s destruction and  spurned by the words of a prophetess thought crazed  goes to a new country  italy  where he will start an empire greater than greece and troy combined that shall rule the world for      years  never to be outdone in the tale of men  the roman empire  

in the      tv miniseries     aeneas is portrayed by alfred enoch 

scenes depicting aeneas  especially from the aeneid  have been the focus of study for centuries  they have been the frequent subject of art and literature since their debut in the  st century 

the artist giovanni battista tiepolo was commissioned by gaetano valmarana in      to fresco several rooms in the villa valmarana  the family villa situated outside vicenza  tiepolo decorated the  palazzina  with scenes from epics such as homer s  iliad  and virgil s  aeneid

amaranth

amaranthus  collectively known as amaranth  is a cosmopolitan genus of annual or short lived perennial plants  some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables  pseudocereals  and ornamental plants  most of the  amaranthus  species are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as pigweed  catkin like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn  approximately    species are recognized  with inflorescences and foliage ranging from purple  through red and green to gold  members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus  celosia  

 amaranth  derives from greek      unfading   with the greek word for  flower       factoring into the word s development as  amaranth    amarant  is an archaic variant 

 amaranthus  shows a wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species  although the family  amaranthaceae  is distinctive  the genus has few distinguishing characters among the    species included  this complicates taxonomy and  amaranthus  has generally been considered among systematists as a  difficult  genus 

formerly  sauer        classified the genus into two subgenera  differentiating only between monoecious and dioecious species   acnida   l   aellen ex k r  robertson and  amaranthus   although this classification was widely accepted  further infrageneric classification was  and still is  needed to differentiate this widely diverse group 

currently   amaranthus  includes three recognized subgenera and    species  although species numbers are questionable due to hybridization and species concepts  infrageneric classification focuses on inflorescence  flower characters and whether a species is monoecious dioecious  as in the sauer        suggested classification  a modified infrageneric classification of  amaranthus  was published by mosyakin   robertson        and includes three subgenera   acnida    amaranthus   and  albersia   the taxonomy is further differentiated by sections within each of the subgenera 

species include 

one cup      dl      g  of cooked amaranth grain  from about    g raw  provides     calories and is an excellent source      or more of the daily value  dv  of protein  dietary fiber  and some dietary minerals  amaranth is particularly rich in manganese       dv   magnesium      dv   iron      dv   and selenium      dv   cooked amaranth leaves are a rich source of vitamin a  vitamin c  calcium  manganese  and folate  amaranth does not contain gluten 

amaranth contains phytochemicals that may be antinutrient factors  such as polyphenols  saponins  tannins  and oxalates which are reduced in content and effect by cooking 

known to the aztecs as   amaranth is thought to have represented up to     of their energy consumption before the spanish conquest  another important use of amaranth throughout mesoamerica was to prepare ritual drinks and foods  to this day  amaranth grains are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with honey  molasses  or chocolate to make a treat called   meaning  joy  in spanish  diego dur  n described the festivities for   the name of which means  left side of the hummingbird  or  hummingbird left hand   real hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers   the aztec month of    december to    december  was dedicated to   people decorated their homes and trees with paper flags  ritual races  processions  dances  songs  prayers  and finally human sacrifices were held  this was one of the more important aztec festivals  and the people prepared for the whole month  they fasted or ate very little  a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey  and at the end of the month  it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a little piece of the god  after the spanish conquest  cultivation of amaranth was outlawed  while some of the festivities were subsumed into the christmas celebration 

because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture  its palatability  ease of cooking  and a protein that is particularly well suited to human nutritional needs  interest in grain amaranth  especially  a  cruentus  and  a  hypochondriacus   revived in the     s  it was recovered in mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated  it is a popular snack sold in mexico  sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice  and its use has spread to europe and parts of north america  amaranth and quinoa are not grasses and are called pseudocereals because of their similarities to cereals in flavor and cooking 

several species are raised for amaranth  grain  in asia and the americas 

ancient amaranth grains still used include the three species   amaranthus caudatus    amaranthus cruentus   and  amaranthus hypochondriacus   although amaranth was cultivated on a large scale in ancient mexico  guatemala  and peru  nowadays it is only cultivated on a small scale there  along with india  china  nepal  and other tropical countries  thus  the potential exists for further cultivation in those countries  as well as in the u s  in a      article in  science   amaranth was described as  the crop of the future   it has been proposed as an inexpensive native crop that could be cultivated by indigenous people in rural areas for several reasons 

amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a leaf vegetable in many parts of the world  four species of  amaranthus  are documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern asia   amaranthus cruentus    amaranthus blitum  amaranthus dubius   and  amaranthus tricolor  

in indonesia and malaysia  leaf amaranth is called   in the philippines  the ilocano word for the plant is   the tagalog word for the plant is or   in uttar pradesh and bihar in india  it is called  chaulai  and is a popular green leafy vegetable  referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called  saag    it is called  chua  in kumaun area of uttarakhand  where it is a popular red green vegetable  in karnataka in india  it is called  harive   it is used to prepare curries such as  hulee  palya  majjigay hulee   and so on  in kerala  it is called  cheera  and is consumed by stir frying the leaves with spices and red chillies to make  cheera thoran   in tamil nadu  it is called  mulaikkira  and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish  where the greens are steamed  and mashed  with light seasoning of salt  red chili  and cumin  it is called  keerai masial   in  andhra pradesh   this leaf is added in preparation of a popular  dal  called in  telugu   in maharashtra  it is called  shravani maath  and is available in both red and white colour  in orissa  it is called  khada saga   it is used to prepare  saga bhaja   in which the leaf is fried with chili and onions 

in china  the leaves and stems are used as a stir fry vegetable  or in soups  in vietnam  it is called and is used to make soup  two species are popular as edible vegetable in vietnam    amaranthus tricolor   and or   amaranthus viridis   

a traditional food plant in africa  amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition  boost food security  foster rural development and support sustainable land care 

in bantu regions of uganda and western kenya  it is known as  doodo  or  litoto   it is also known among the kalenjin as a drought crop   chepkerta    in lingala  spoken in the congo   it is known as or   in nigeria  it is a common vegetable and goes with all nigerian starch dishes  it is known in yoruba as a short form of  meaning make the husband fat  or  meaning  we have money left over for fish    in the caribbean  the leaves are called  bhaji  in trinidad and  callaloo  in jamaica  and are saut  ed with onions  garlic  and tomatoes  or sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot soup  in botswana  it is referred to as  morug  and cooked as a staple green vegetable 

in greece  green amaranth   a  viridis   is a popular dish called   or   it is boiled  then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad  sometimes alongside fried fish  greeks stop harvesting the plant  which also grows wild  when it starts to bloom at the end of august 

in brazil  green amaranth was  and to a degree still is  frequently regarded as an invasive species as all other species of amaranth  except the generally imported  a  caudatus  cultivar   though some have traditionally appreciated it as a leaf vegetable  under the names of or   which is consumed cooked  generally accompanying the staple food  rice and beans 

making up about    of the total fatty acids of amaranth  squalene is extracted as a vegetable based alternative to the more expensive shark oil for use in dietary supplements and cosmetics 

the flowers of the  hopi red dye  amaranth were used by the hopi  a tribe in the western united states  as the source of a deep red dye  also a synthetic dye was named  amaranth  for its similarity in color to the natural amaranth pigments known as betalains  this synthetic dye is also known as red no    in north america and e    in the european union 

the genus also contains several well known ornamental plants  such as  amaranthus caudatus   love lies bleeding   a vigorous  hardy annual with dark purplish flowers crowded in handsome drooping spikes  another indian annual   a  hypochondriacus   prince s feather   has deeply veined  lance shaped leaves  purple on the under face  and deep crimson flowers densely packed on erect spikes 

amaranths are recorded as food plants for some lepidoptera  butterfly and moth  species including the nutmeg moth and various case bearer moths of the genus  coleophora    c  amaranthella    c  enchorda   feeds exclusively on  amaranthus     c  immortalis   feeds exclusively on  amaranthus     c  lineapulvella   and  c  versurella   recorded on  a  spinosus   

amaranth weed species have an extended period of germination  rapid growth  and high rates of seed production  and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid     s  this is partially due to the reduction in tillage  reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often  the following   species of  amaranthus  are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the u s and canada   a  albus    a  blitoides    a  hybridus    a  palmeri    a  powellii    a  retroflexus    a  spinosus    a  tuberculatus   and  a  viridis  

a new herbicide resistant strain of  amaranthus palmeri  has appeared  it is glyphosate resistant and so cannot be killed by herbicides using the chemical  also  this plant can survive in tough conditions  the species  amaranthus palmeri   palmer amaranth  causes the greatest reduction in soybean yields and has the potential to reduce yields by        in field experiments  palmer amaranth is among the  top five most troublesome weeds  in the southeast of the united states and has already evolved resistances to dinitroaniline herbicides and acetolactate synthase inhibitors  this makes the proper identification of  amaranthus  species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists  proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions 

an evolutionary lineage of around    species within the genus has acquired the carbon fixation pathway  which increases their photosynthetic efficiency  this probably occurred in the miocene 







agapanthus africanus

agapanthus africanus  african lily  is a flowering plant from the genus  agapanthus  native to the area of cape of good hope in south africa   a  africanus  is more difficult to grow in gardens than  a  praecox   and almost all plants sold as  a  africanus  are actually  a  praecox  

it has a short stem bearing a tuft of long  narrow  arching leaves          cm long and        cm broad  and a central flower stalk          cm tall  ending in an umbel of       white  or bright blue  funnel shaped flowers  each flower          cm diameter 

it was introduced to europe at the close of the   th century  unlike the more common  a  praecox   it is not generally suitable as a garden plant  and will not tolerate extended freezing temperatures 






agamemnon

in greek mythology  agamemnon          gam  mn  n   was a king of mycenae  the son of king atreus and queen aerope of mycenae  the brother of menelaus  the husband of clytemnestra and the father of iphigenia  electra or laodike                   orestes and chrysothemis  legends make him the king of mycenae or argos  thought to be different names for the same area  when helen  the wife of menelaus  was taken to troy by paris  agamemnon commanded the united greek armed forces in the ensuing trojan war 

upon agamemnon s return from troy  he was killed  according to the oldest surviving account   odyssey               by aegisthus  the lover of his wife clytemnestra  in old versions of the story  the scene of the murder  when it is specified  is usually the house of aegisthus  who has not taken up residence in agamemnon s palace  and it involves an ambush and the deaths of agamemnon s followers as well  in some later versions  clytemnestra herself does the killing  or they act together as accomplices  killing agamemnon in his own home 

his name in greek                       means  very steadfast    unbowed   the word comes from                      from             very much  and                  think on  

atreus  agamemnon s father  murdered the sons of his twin brother thyestes and fed them to thyestes after discovering thyestes  adultery with his wife aerope  thyestes fathered aegisthus with his own daughter  pelopia  and this son vowed gruesome revenge on atreus  children  aegisthus successfully murdered atreus and restored his father to the throne  aegisthus took possession of the throne of mycenae and jointly ruled with thyestes  during this period  agamemnon and his brother  menelaus  took refuge with tyndareus  king of sparta  there they respectively married tyndareus  daughters clytemnestra and helen  agamemnon and clytemnestra had four children  one son  orestes  and three daughters  iphigenia  electra and chrysothemis  menelaus succeeded tyndareus in sparta  while agamemnon  with his brother s assistance  drove out aegisthus and thyestes to recover his father s kingdom  he extended his dominion by conquest and became the most powerful prince in greece 

agamemnon s family history had been tarnished by murder  incest  and treachery  consequences of the heinous crime perpetrated by his ancestor  tantalus  and then of a curse placed upon pelops  son of tantalus  by myrtilus  whom he had murdered  thus misfortune hounded successive generations of the house of atreus  until atoned by orestes in a court of justice held jointly by humans and gods 

agamemnon gathered the reluctant greek forces to sail for troy  preparing to depart from ancient greece  which was a port in boeotia  agamemnon s army incurred the wrath of the goddess artemis  there are several reasons throughout myth for such wrath  in aeschylus  play  agamemnon   artemis is angry for the young men who will die at troy  whereas in sophocles   electra   agamemnon has slain an animal sacred to artemis  and subsequently boasted that he was artemis  equal in hunting  misfortunes  including a plague and a lack of wind  prevented the army from sailing  finally  the prophet calchas announced that the wrath of the goddess could only be propitiated by the sacrifice of agamemnon s daughter iphigenia 

classical dramatizations differ on how willing either father or daughter was to this fate  some include such trickery as claiming she was to be married to achilles  but agamemnon did eventually sacrifice iphigenia  her death appeased artemis  and the greek army set out for troy  several alternatives to the human sacrifice have been presented in greek mythology  other sources  such as  iphigenia at aulis   say that agamemnon was prepared to kill his daughter  but that artemis accepted a deer in her place  and whisked her away to tauris in the crimean peninsula  hesiod said she became the goddess hecate 

agamemnon was the commander in chief of the greeks during the trojan war  during the fighting  agamemnon killed antiphus and fifteen other trojan soldiers  according to one source  but in the  iliad  itself  he s shown to slaughter hundreds more in book    during his  aristea  loosely translated to  day of glory  which is the most similar to achilles   aristea  in book     they both are compared to lions and destructive fires in battle  their hands are described as  splattered with gore  and  invincible   the trojans flee to the walls  they both are appealed to by one of their victims  they are both avoided by hector  they both get wounded in the arm or hand  and they both kill the one who wounded them   even before his  aristea   agamemnon was considered to be one of the three best warriors on the greek side as proven when hector challenges any champion of the greek side to fight him in book    and agamemnon  along with diomedes and big aias  is one of the three most wished for to face him out of the nine strongest greek warriors who volunteered  and after they reconciled  even achilles admits in book    that agamemnon is  the best in strength and in throwing the spear   that claim is further proven by the fact that agamemnon was the only major warrior on either side to never need the gods  direct intervention to increase his strength or give him any unfair advantages in battle and yet he still caused incredible destruction almost on the scale of achilles 

the  iliad  tells the story about the quarrel between agamemnon and achilles in the final year of the war  following one of the achaean army s raids  chryseis  daughter of chryses  one of apollo s priests  was taken as a war prize by agamemnon  chryses pleaded with agamemnon to free his daughter but was met with little success  chryses then prayed to apollo for the safe return of his daughter  which apollo responded to by unleashing a plague over the achaean army  after learning from the prophet calchas that the plague could be dispelled by returning chryseis to her father  agamemnon reluctantly agreed  but first berated calchas for previously forcing agamemnon to sacrifice his daughter  iphigenia  and released his prize  however  as compensation for his lost prize  agamemnon demanded a new prize  as a result  agamemnon stole an attractive slave called briseis  one of the spoils of war  from achilles 

achilles  the greatest warrior of the age  withdrew from battle in response to agamemnon s action and put the greek armies at risk of losing the war  agamemnon  having realized achilles s importance in winning the war against the trojan army  sent ambassadors begging for achilles to return  offering him riches and the hand of his daughter in marriage  but achilles refused  only being spurred back into action when his closest friend  patroclus  was killed in battle 

although not the equal of achilles in bravery  agamemnon was a representative of  kingly authority   as commander in chief  he summoned the princes to the council and led the army in battle  his chief fault was his overwhelming haughtiness  an over exalted opinion of his position that led him to insult chryses and achilles  thereby bringing great disaster upon the greeks 

after the capture of troy  cassandra  the doomed prophetess and daughter of priam  fell to agamemnon s lot in the distribution of the prizes of war 

after a stormy voyage  agamemnon and cassandra either landed in argolis  or were blown off course and landed in aegisthus  country  clytemnestra  agamemnon s wife  had taken aegisthus  son of thyestes  as a lover  when agamemnon came home he was slain by either aegisthus  in the oldest versions of the story  or clytemnestra  according to the accounts given by pindar and the tragedians  agamemnon was slain in a bath by his wife alone  a blanket of cloth or a net having first been thrown over him to prevent resistance  clytemnestra also killed cassandra  her jealousy of cassandra  and her wrath at the sacrifice of iphigenia and at agamemnon s having gone to war over helen of troy  are said to have been the motives for her crime  

aegisthus and clytemnestra then ruled agamemnon s kingdom for a time  aegisthus claiming his right of revenge for agamemnon s father atreus having fed thyestes his own children  thyestes then crying out  so perish all the race of pleisthenes    thus explaining aegisthus  action as justified by his father s curse   agamemnon s son orestes later avenged his father s murder  with the help or encouragement of his sister electra  by murdering aegisthus and clytemnestra  his own mother   thereby inciting the wrath of the erinyes  english  the furies   winged goddesses who tracked down wrongdoers with their hounds  noses and drove them to insanity 

athenaeus tells a tale of how agamemnon mourned the loss of his friend or lover argynnus  when he drowned in the cephisus river  he buried him  honored with a tomb and a shrine to aphrodite argynnis  this episode is also found in clement of alexandria  in stephen of byzantium   kopai  and  argunnos    and in propertius  iii with minor variations 
the fortunes of agamemnon have formed the subject of numerous tragedies  ancient and modern  the most famous being the  oresteia  of aeschylus  in the legends of the peloponnesus  agamemnon was regarded as the highest type of a powerful monarch  and in sparta he was worshipped under the title of  zeus agamemnon   his tomb was pointed out among the ruins of mycenae and at amyclae 

another account makes him the son of pleisthenes  the son or father of atreus   who is said to have been aerope s first husband 

in works of art  there is considerable resemblance between the representations of zeus  king of the gods  and agamemnon  king of men  he is generally depicted with a sceptre and diadem  conventional attributes of kings 

agamemnon s mare was named aetha  she was also one of two horses driven by menelaus at the funeral games of patroclus 

following his death at the hands of aegisthus  agamemnon made an appearance in homer s  odyssey  within the kingdom of hades  there  the former king met odysseus and explained just how he was murdered before he offered odysseus a warning about the dangers of trusting a woman 







aga khan i

aga khan i   or    was the title accorded to hasan ali shah                     the governor of kirman    th imam of the nizari ismaili muslims  and prominent muslim leader in iran and later in the indian subcontinent 

the imam hasan ali shah was born in      in kahak  iran to shah khalil allah  the   th ismaili imam  and bibi sarkara  the daughter of muhammad sadiq mahallati  d         a poet and a ni   mat allahi sufi  shah khalil allah moved to yazd in       probably out of concern for his indian followers  who used to travel to persia to see their imam and for whom yazd was a much closer and safer destination than kahak  meanwhile  his wife and children  including hasan ali  continued to live in kahak off the revenues obtained from the family holdings in the mahallat    region  two years later  in       shah khalil allah was killed in yazd during a brawl between some of his followers and local shopkeepers  he was succeeded by his eldest son hasan ali shah  also known as muhammad hasan  who became the   th imam 

while khalil allah resided in yazd  his land holdings in kahak were being managed by his son in law  imani khan farahani  husband of his daughter shah bibi  after khalil allah s death  a conflict ensued between imani khan farahani and the local nizaris  followers of imam khalil allah   as a result of which khalil allah s widow and children found themselves left unprovided for  the young imam and his mother moved to qumm  but their financial situation worsened  the dowager decided to go to the qajar court in tehran to obtain justice for her husband s death and was eventually successful  those who had been involved in the shah khalil allah s murder were punished  not only that  but the persian king fath ali shah gave his own daughter  princess sarv i jahan khanum  in marriage to the young imam hasan ali shah and provided a princely dowry in land holdings in the mahallat region  king fath ali shah also appointed hasan ali shah as governor of qumm and bestowed upon him the honorific of  aga khan   thus did the title of  aga khan  enter the family  hasan ali shah become known as aga khan mahallati  and the title of aga khan was inherited by his successors  aga khan i s mother later moved to india where she died in       until fath ali shah s death in       the imam hasan ali shah enjoyed a quiet life and was held in high esteem at the qajar court 

soon after the accession of muhammad shah qajar to the throne of his grandfather  fath ali shah  the imam hasan ali shah was appointed governor of kerman in       at the time  kerman was held by the rebellious sons of shuja al saltana  a pretender to the qajar throne  the area was also frequently raided by the afghans  hasan ali shah managed to restore order in kerman  as well as in bam and narmashir  which were also held by rebellious groups  hasan ali shah sent a report of his success to tehran  but did not receive any material appreciation for his achievements  despite the service he rendered to the qajar government  hasan ali shah was dismissed from the governorship of kerman in       less than two years after his arrival there  and was replaced by firuz mirza nusrat al dawla  a younger brother of muhammad shah qajar  refusing to accept his dismissal  hasan ali shah withdrew with his forces to the citadel at bam  along with his two brothers  he made preparations to resist the government forces that were sent against him  he was besieged at bam for some fourteen months  when it was clear that continuing the resistance was of little use  hasan ali shah sent one of his brothers to shiraz in order to speak to the governor of fars to intervene on his behalf and arrange for safe passage out of kerman  with the governor having interceded  hasan ali shah surrendered and emerged from the citadel of bam only to be double crossed  he was seized and his possessions were plundered by the government troops  hasan ali shah and his dependents were sent to kerman and remained as prisoners there for eight months  he was eventually allowed to go to tehran near the end of         where he was able to present his case before the shah  the shah pardoned him on the condition that he return peacefully to mahallat  hasan ali shah remained in mahallat for about two years  he managed to gather an army in mahallat which alarmed muhammad shah  who travelled to delijan near mahallat to determine the truth of the reports about hasan ali shah  hasan ali shah was on a hunting trip at the time  but he sent a messenger to request permission of the monarch to go to mecca for the hajj pilgrimage  permission was given  and hasan ali shah s mother and a few relatives were sent to najaf and other holy cities in iraq in which the shrines of his ancestors  the shiite imams are found 

prior to leaving mahallat  hasan ali shah equipped himself with letters appointing him to the governorship of kerman  accompanied by his brothers  nephews and other relatives  as well as many followers  he left for yazd  where he intended to meet some of his local followers  hasan ali shah sent the documents reinstating him to the position of governor of kerman to bahman mirza baha al dawla  the governor of yazd  bahman mirza offered hasan ali shah lodging in the city  but hasan ali shah declined  indicating that he wished to visit his followers living around yazd  hajji mirza aqasi sent a messenger to bahman mirza to inform him of the spuriousness of hasan ali shah s documents and a battle between bahman m  rz   and hasan ali shah broke out in which bahman mirza was defeated  other minor battles were won by hasan ali shah before he arrived in shahr e babak  which he intended to use as his base for capturing kerman  at the time of his arrival in shahr e babak  a formal local governor was engaged in a campaign to drive out the afghans from the city s citadel  and hasan ali shah joined him in forcing the afghans to surrender 

soon after march       hasan ali shah set out for kerman  he managed to defeat a government force consisting of       men near dashtab  and continued to win a number of victories before stopping at bam for a time  soon  a government force of        men forced hasan ali shah to flee from bam to rigan on the border of baluchistan  where he suffered a decisive defeat  hasan ali shah decided to escape to afghanistan  accompanied by his brothers and many soldiers and servants 

fleeing iran  he arrived in kandahar  afghanistan in        a town that had been occupied by an anglo indian army in      in the first anglo afghan war  a close relationship developed between hasan ali shah and the british  which coincided with the final years of the first anglo afghan war                after his arrival  hasan ali shah wrote to sir william macnaghten  discussing his plans to seize and govern herat on behalf of the british  although the proposal seemed to have been approved  the plans of the british were thwarted by the uprising of dost muhammad s son muhammad akbar khan  who defeated and annihilated the british indian garrison at gandamak on its retreat from kabul in january      

hasan ali shah soon proceeded to sindh  where he rendered further services to the british  the british were able to annex sindh and for his services  hasan ali shah received an annual pension of         from general charles james napier  the british conqueror of sindh with whom he had a good relationship 

in october       hasan ali shah left sind for city of bombay in bombay presidency  british india passing through cutch and kathiawar where he spent some time visiting the communities of his followers in the area  after arriving in bombay in february       the persian government demanded his extradition from india  the british refused and only agreed to transfer hasan ali shah s residence to calcutta  where it would be harder for him to launch new attacks against the persian government  the british also negotiated the safe return of hasan ali shah to persia  which was in accordance with his own wish  the government agreed to hasan ali shah s return provided that he would avoid passing through baluchistan and kirman and that he was to settle peacefully in mahallat  hasan ali shah was eventually forced to leave for calcutta in april       where he remained until he received news of the death of muhammad shah qajar  hasan ali shah left for bombay and the british attempted to obtain permission for his return to persia  although some of his lands were restored to the control of his relatives  his safe return could not be arranged  and hasan ali shah was forced to remain a permanent resident of india  while in india  hasan ali shah continued his close relationship with the british  and was even visited by the prince of wales  the future king edward vii  when he was on a state visit to india  the british came to address hasan ali shah as his highness  hasan ali shah received protection from the british government in british india as the spiritual head of an important muslim community 

the vast majority of his khoja ismaili followers in india welcomed him warmly  but some dissident members  sensing their loss of prestige with the arrival of the imam  wished to maintain control over communal properties  because of this  hasan ali shah decided to secure a pledge of loyalty from the members of the community to himself and to the ismaili form of islam  although most of the members of the community signed a document issued by hasan ali shah summarizing the practices of the ismailis  a group of dissenting khojas surprisingly asserted that the community had always been sunni  this group was outcast by the unanimous vote of all the khojas assembled in bombay  in       these dissenters filed a suit in the bombay high court against hasan ali shah  claiming that the khojas had been sunni muslims from the very beginning  the case  commonly referred to as the aga khan case  was heard by sir joseph arnould  the hearing lasted several weeks  and included testimony from hasan ali shah himself  after reviewing the history of the community  justice arnould gave a definitive and detailed judgement against the plaintiffs and in favour of hasan ali shah and other defendants  the judgement was significant in that it legally established the status of the khojas as a community referred to as shia imami ismailis  and of hasan ali shah as the spiritual head of that community  hasan ali shah s authority thereafter was not seriously challenged again 

hasan ali shah spent his final years in bombay with occasional visits to pune  maintaining the traditions of the iranian nobility to which he belonged  he kept excellent stables and became a well known figure at the bombay racecourse  hasan ali shah died after an imamate of sixty four years in april       he was buried in a specially built shrine at hasanabad in the mazagaon area of bombay  he was survived by three sons and five daughters  hasan ali shah was succeeded as imam by his eldest son aqa ali shah  who became aga khan ii

   ever since the time of my ancestor ali  the first imam  that is to say over a period of thirteen hundred years  it has always been the tradition of our family that each imam chooses his successor at his absolute and unfettered discretion from amongst any of his descendants  whether they be sons or remote male issue and in these circumstances and in view of the fundamentally altered conditions in the world in very recent years due to the great changes which have taken place including the discoveries of atomic science  i am convinced that it is in the best interest of the shia muslim ismailia community that i should be succeeded by a young man who has been brought up and developed during recent years and in the midst of the new age and who brings a new outlook on life to his office as imam  for these reasons  i appoint my grandson karim  the son of my own son  aly salomone khan to succeed to the title of aga khan and to the imam and pir of all shia ismailian followers   

he is buried in at the mausoleum of aga khan  on the nile in aswan  egypt

alexander agassiz

alexander emmanuel rodolphe agassiz  december         march            son of louis agassiz and stepson of elizabeth cabot agassiz  was an american scientist and engineer 

agassiz was born in neuch  tel  switzerland and immigrated to the united states with his father  louis  in       he graduated from harvard university in       subsequently studying engineering and chemistry  and taking the degree of bachelor of science at the lawrence scientific school of the same institution in       in      became an assistant in the united states coast survey  
thenceforward he became a specialist in marine ichthyology  agassiz was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in       up until the summer of       agassiz worked as an assistant in the museum of natural history that his father founded at harvard 
e  j  hulbert  a friend of agassiz s brother in law  quincy adams shaw  had discovered a rich copper lode known as the calumet conglomerate on the keweenaw peninsula in michigan  hulbert persuaded them  along with a group of friends  to purchase a controlling interest in the mines  which later became known as the calumet and hecla mining company based in calumet  michigan  that summer  he took a trip to see the mines for himself and he afterwards became treasurer of the enterprise 

over the winter of      and early       mining operations began to falter  due to the difficulty of extracting copper from the conglomerate  hulbert had sold his interests in the mines and had moved on to other ventures  but agassiz refused to give up hope for the mines  he returned to the mines in march       with his wife and young son  at that time  calumet was a remote settlement  virtually inaccessible during the winter and very far removed from civilization even during the summer  with insufficient supplies at the mines  agassiz struggled to maintain order  while back in boston  shaw was saddled with debt and the collapse of their interests  shaw obtained financial assistance from john simpkins  the selling agent for the enterprise to continue operations 

agassiz continued to live at calumet  making gradual progress in stabilizing the mining operations  such that he was able to leave the mines under the control of a general manager and return to boston in      before winter closed navigation  the mines continued to prosper and in may       several mines were consolidated to form the calumet and hecla mining company with shaw as its first president  in august       shaw  retired  to the board of directors and agassiz became president  a position he held until his death  until the turn of the century  this company was by far the largest copper producer in the united states  many years producing over half of the total 

agassiz was a major factor in the mine s continued success and visited the mines twice a year  he innovated by installing a giant engine  known as the superior  which was able to lift    tons of rock from a depth of   he also built a railroad and dredged a channel to navigable waters  however  after a time the mines did not require his full time  year round  attention and he returned to his interests in natural history at harvard  out of his copper fortune  he gave some us         to harvard for the museum of comparative zoology and other purposes 

shortly after the death of his father in       agassiz acquired a small peninsula in newport  rhode island  which features spectacular views of narragansett bay  here he built a substantial house and a laboratory for use as his summer residence  the house was completed in      and today is known as the inn at castle hill 

in       he surveyed lake titicaca  peru  examined the copper mines of peru and chile  and made a collection of peruvian antiquities for the museum of comparative zoology  mcz   of which he was first curator from      to      and then director until his death in       he assisted charles wyville thomson in the examination and classification of the collections of the       challenger  expedition  and wrote the  review of the echini     vols                in the reports  between      and      he took part in the three dredging expeditions of the steamer  blake  of the coast survey  and presented a full account of them in two volumes        

in      agassiz visited fiji and queensland and inspected the great barrier reef  publishing a paper on the subject in      

of agassiz s other writings on marine zoology  most are contained in the bulletins and memoirs of the museum of comparative zoology  however  in       he published with elizabeth cary agassiz  his stepmother   seaside studies in natural history   a work at once exact and stimulating  they also published  in        marine animals of massachusetts bay  

he received the german order pour le m  rite for science and arts in august

agathon

agathon        was an athenian tragic poet whose works have been lost  he is best known for his appearance in plato s  symposium   which describes the banquet given to celebrate his obtaining a prize for his first tragedy at the lenaia in      he is also a prominent character in aristophanes  comedy the  thesmophoriazusae  

agathon was the son of tisamenus  and the lifelong companion of pausanias  with whom he appears in both the  symposium  and plato s  protagoras   together with pausanias  he later moved to the court of archelaus  king of macedon  who was recruiting playwrights  it is here that he probably died around     bc  agathon introduced certain innovations into the greek theater  aristotle tells us in the  poetics       a  that the characters and plot of his  anthos  were original and not  following athenian dramatic orthodoxy  borrowed from mythological or historical subjects  agathon was also the first playwright to write choral parts which were apparently independent from the main plot of his plays 

agathon is portrayed by plato as a handsome young man  well dressed  of polished manners  courted by the fashion  wealth and wisdom of athens  and dispensing hospitality with ease and refinement  the epideictic speech in praise of love which agathon recites in the  symposium  is full of beautiful but artificial rhetorical expressions  and has led some scholars to believe he may have been a student of gorgias  in the  symposium   agathon is presented as the friend of the comic poet aristophanes  but this alleged friendship did not prevent aristophanes from harshly criticizing agathon in at least two of his comic plays  the  thesmophoriazousae  and the  now lost   gerytades   in the later play  frogs   aristophanes softens his criticisms  but even so it may be only for the sake of punning on agathon s name                 good   that he makes dionysus call him a  good poet  

agathon was also a friend of euripides  another recruit to the court of archelaus of macedon 

agathon s extraordinary physical beauty is brought up repeatedly in the sources  the historian w  rhys roberts observes that                                 ho kalos agathon   has become almost a stereotyped phrase   the most detailed surviving description of agathon is in the  thesmophoriazousae   in which agathon appears as a pale  clean shaven young man dressed in women s clothes  scholars are unsure how much of aristophanes  portrayal is fact and how much mere comic invention 

after a close reading of the  thesmophoriazousae   the historian jane mcintosh snyder observed that agathon s costume was almost identical to that of the famous lyric poet anacreon  as he is portrayed in early  th century vase paintings  snyder theorizes that agathon might have made a deliberate effort to mimic the sumptuous attire of his famous fellow poet  although by agathon s time  such clothing  especially the                        kekryphalos   an elaborate covering for the hair  had long fallen out of fashion for men  according to this interpretation  agathon is mocked in the  thesmophoriazousae  not only for his notorious effeminacy  but also for the pretentiousness of his dress   he seems to think of himself  in all his elegant finery  as a rival to the old ionian poets  perhaps even to anacreon himself  

agathon has been thought to be the subject of  lovers  lips   an epigram attributed to plato 

another translation reads 

although the authenticity of this epigram was accepted for many centuries  it was probably not composed for agathon the tragedian  nor was it composed by plato  stylistic evidence suggests that the poem  with most of plato s other alleged epigrams  was actually written some time after plato had died  its form is that of the hellenistic erotic epigram  which did not become popular until after     bc  according to   th century scholar walther ludwig  the poems were spuriously inserted into an early biography of plato sometime between     bc and     bc and adopted by later writers from this source 

of agathon s plays  only six titles and thirty one fragments have survived

agesilaus ii

agesilaus ii     agesilaos   c              c      bc   was a king   basileus   of the ancient greek city state of sparta and a member of the eurypontid dynasty ruling from     to about     bc  during most of which time he was  in plutarch s words   as good as though commander and king of all greece   and was for the whole of it greatly identified with his country s deeds and fortunes  small in stature and lame from birth  agesilaus became ruler somewhat unexpectedly in his mid forties  his reign saw successful military incursions into various states in asia minor  as well as successes in the corinthian war  however  several diplomatic decisions resulted in sparta becoming increasingly isolated prior to his death at the age of    in cyrenaica 

agesilaus was greatly admired by his friend  the historian xenophon  who wrote a minor work about him titled  agesilaus  

agesilaus was the son of archidamus ii and his second wife  eupoleia  brother to cynisca  the first woman in ancient history to achieve an olympic victory   and younger half brother of agis ii 

there is little surviving detail on the youth of agesilaus  born with one leg shorter  he was not expected to succeed to the throne after his brother king agis ii  especially because the latter had a son  leotychidas   therefore  agesilaus was trained in the traditional curriculum of sparta  the  agoge   however  leotychidas was ultimately set aside as illegitimate  contemporary rumors representing him as the son of alcibiades  and agesilaus became king in      at the age of about forty  in addition to questions of his nephew s paternity  agesilaus  succession was largely due to the intervention of the spartan general  lysander  who hoped to find in him a willing tool for the furtherance of his political designs  lysander and the young agesilaus came to maintain an intimate relation  see pederasty in ancient greece   as was common of the period  their unique relationship would serve an important role during agesilaus  later campaigns in asia minor 

agesilaus is first recorded as king during the suppression of the conspiracy of cinadon  shortly after     bc  then  in      agesilaus crossed into asia with a force of       neodamodes  freed helots  and       allies  including    spartiates  to liberate greek cities from persian dominion  on the eve of sailing from aulis he attempted to offer a sacrifice  as agamemnon had done before the trojan expedition  but the thebans intervened to prevent it  an insult for which he never forgave them  
on his arrival at ephesus in     bc  a three months  truce was concluded with tissaphernes  the satrap of lydia and caria  but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless  and on its termination agesilaus raided hellespontine phrygia  where he easily won immense booty from the satrap pharnabazus  tissaphernes could offer no assistance  as he had concentrated his troops in caria  in these campaigns agesilaus also benefited from the aid of some of the ten thousand  a greek mercenary army   who had marched through miles of persian territory to reach the black sea a few years earlier          bc   after spending the winter organizing a cavalry force   hippeis    he made a successful incursion into lydia in the spring of      tithraustes was sent to replace tissaphernes  who paid with his life for his continued failure  
an armistice was concluded between tithraustes and agesilaus  who left the southern satrapy and again invaded hellespontine phrygia  which he ravaged until the following spring  he then came to an agreement with pharnabazus whom he met personally  and once more turned southward 

during these campaigns  lysander attempted to manipulate agesilaus into ceding his authority  agesilaus would have nothing of this  and reminded lysander  who was only a spartan general  who was king  he had lysander sent away to assist the naval campaigns in the aegean  this dominating move by agesilaus earned the respect of his men at arms and of lysander himself  who remained emotionally close with agesilaus 

in      while encamped on the plain of thebe  agesilaus was planning a campaign in the interior of asia minor  or even an attack on artaxerxes ii himself  when he was recalled to greece to fight in the corinthian war between sparta and the combined forces of athens  thebes  corinth  argos and several minor states  the outbreak of the conflict had been encouraged by persian payments to sparta s greek rivals  tens of thousands of darics  the main currency in achaemenid coinage  were used to bribe the greek states to start a war against sparta  according to plutarch  agesilaus said upon leaving asia minor  i have been driven out by        persian archers   a reference to  archers    toxotai   the greek nickname for the darics from their obverse design  because that much money had been paid to politicians in athens and thebes in order to start a war against sparta  

a rapid march through thrace and macedonia brought him to thessaly  where he repulsed the thessalian cavalry who tried to impede him  reinforced by phocian and orchomenian troops and a spartan army  he met the confederate forces at coronea in boeotia and in a hotly contested battle was technically victorious  however  the spartan baggage train was ransacked and agesilaus himself was injured during the fighting  resulting in a subsequent retreat by way of delphi to the peloponnese  shortly before this battle the spartan navy  of which he had received the supreme command  was totally defeated off cnidus by a powerful persian fleet under conon and pharnabazus 

during these conflicts in mainland greece  lysander perished while attacking the walls of thebes  pausanias  the second king of sparta  see spartan constitution for more information on sparta s dual monarchy   was supposed to provide lysander with reinforcements as they marched into boeotia  yet failed to arrive in time to assist lysander  likely because pausanias disliked him for his brash and arrogant attitude towards the spartan royalty and government  pausanias failed to fight for the bodies of the dead  and because he retrieved the bodies under truce  a sign of defeat   he was disgraced and banished from sparta 

in      agesilaus engaged in a ravaging invasion of argolis  in     bc he made several successful expeditions into corinthian territory  capturing lechaeum and piraeus  the loss  however  of a battalion  mora   destroyed by iphicrates  neutralized these successes  and agesilaus returned to sparta  in     bc he conducted a campaign in acarnania  but two years later the peace of antalcidas  warmly supported by agesilaus  put an end to the war  maintaining spartan hegemony over greece and returning the greek cities of asia minor to the achaemenid empire  in this interval  agesilaus declined command over sparta s aggression on mantineia  and justified phoebidas  seizure of the theban cadmea so long as the outcome provided glory to sparta 

when war broke out afresh with thebes  agesilaus twice invaded boeotia  in     and     bc   although he spent the next five years largely out of action due to an unspecified but apparently grave illness  in the congress of     an altercation is recorded between him and the theban general epaminondas  and due to his influence  thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace  and orders given for cleombrotus to march against thebes in      cleombrotus was defeated at leuctra and the spartan supremacy overthrown 

in     agesilaus was engaged in an embassy to mantineia  and reassured the spartans with an invasion of arcadia  he preserved an un walled sparta against the revolts and conspiracies of helots  perioeci and even other spartans  and against external enemies  with four different armies led by epaminondas penetrating laconia that same year  again  in      epaminondas almost succeeded in seizing the city with a rapid and unexpected march  the battle of mantinea  in which agesilaus took no part  was followed by a general peace  sparta  however  stood aloof  hoping even yet to recover her supremacy  according to xenophon  agesilaus  in order to gain money for prosecuting the war  supported the satrap ariobarzanes ii in his revolt against artaxerxes ii in      revolt of the satraps  
in      agesilaus went to egypt at the head of a mercenary force to aid the king nectanebo i and his regent teos against persia  he soon transferred his services to teos s cousin and rival nectanebo ii  who  in return for his help  gave him a sum of over     talents  on his way home agesilaus died in cyrenaica  around the age of     after a reign of some    years  his body was embalmed in wax  and buried at sparta 

he was succeeded by his son archidamus iii 

agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance  and was lame from birth  these facts were used as an argument against his succession  an oracle having warned sparta against a  lame reign   most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in guerrilla warfare  alert and quick  yet cautious   a man  moreover  whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time  of his courage  temperance  and hardiness  many instances are cited  and to these were added the less spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend  as examples  there is the story of his riding a stick horse with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that he not mention till he himself were the father of children  and because of the affection of his son archidamus  for cleonymus  he saved sphodrias  cleonymus  father  from execution for his incursion into the piraeus  and dishonorable retreat  in      modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of agesilaus  reputation and achievements  reckoning him an excellent soldier  but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and siegecraft 

as a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies  agesilaus was most successful in the opening and closing periods of his reign  commencing but then surrendering a glorious career in asia  and in extreme age  maintaining his prostrate country  other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home  but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to spartan decline  notably his unremitting hatred of thebes  which led to sparta s humiliation at the battle of leuctra and thus the end of spartan hegemony  historian j  b  bury remarks that  there is something melancholy about his career   born into a sparta that was the unquestioned continental power of hellas  the sparta which mourned him eighty four years later had suffered a series of military defeats which would have been unthinkable to his forbears  had seen its population severely decline  and had run so short of money that its soldiers were increasingly sent on campaigns fought more for money than for defense or glory 

other historical accounts paint agesilaus as a prototype for the ideal leader  his awareness  thoughtfulness  and wisdom were all traits to be emulated diplomatically  while his bravery and shrewdness in battle epitomized the heroic greek commander  these historians point towards the unstable oligarchies established by lysander in the former athenian empire and the failures of spartan leaders  such as pausanias and kleombrotos  for the eventually suppression of spartan power  the ancient historian xenophon was a huge admirer and served under agesilaus during the campaigns into asia minor 

plutarch includes among agesilaus     essays and speeches comprising the apophthegmata agesilaus  letter to the ephors on his recall 
and when asked whether agesilaus wanted a memorial erected in his honor 

agesilaus lived in the most frugal style alike at home and in the field  and though his campaigns were undertaken largely to secure booty  he was content to enrich the state and his friends and to return as poor as he had set forth 

when someone was praising an orator for his ability to magnify small points  agesilaus said   in my opinion it s not a good cobbler who fits large shoes on small feet  

another time agesilaus watched a mouse being pulled from its hole by a small boy  when the mouse turned around  bit the hand of its captor and escaped  he pointed this out to those present and said   when the tiniest creature defends itself like this against aggressors  what ought men to do  do you reckon  

certainly when somebody asked what gain the laws of lycurgus had brought sparta  agesilaus answered   contempt for pleasures  

asked once how far sparta s boundaries stretched  agesilaus brandished his spear and said   as far as this can reach  

on noticing a house in asia roofed with square beams  agesilaus asked the owner whether timber grew square in that area  when told no  it grew round  he said   what then  if it were square  would you make it round  

invited to hear an actor who could perfectly imitate the nightingale  agesilaus declined  saying he had heard the nightingale itself

agrippina the elder

agrippina the elder  latin  vipsania agrippina   classical latin    c     bc     ad      commonly referred to as  agrippina the elder   latin   agrippina maior    was a prominent member of the julio claudian dynasty  she was born in c     bc the daughter of marcus vipsanius agrippa  a close supporter of rome s first emperor augustus  and augustus  daughter julia the elder  at the time of her birth  her brothers lucius and gaius were the adoptive sons of augustus and were his heirs until their deaths in ad   and    respectively  following their deaths  her cousin germanicus was made the adoptive son of tiberius as part of augustus  succession scheme in the adoptions of ad   in which tiberius was adopted by augustus  as a corollary to the adoption  agrippina was wed to germanicus in order to bring him closer to the julian family 

she is known to have traveled with him throughout his career  taking her children everywhere they went  in ad     germanicus was deployed in gaul as governor and general  while there  the late augustus sent her son gaius to her unspecified location  she liked to dress him in a little soldiers  outfit complete with boots for which gaius earned the nickname  caligula    little boots    after three years in gaul they returned to rome and her husband was awarded a triumph on    may ad    to commemorate his victories  the following year  germanicus was sent to govern over the eastern provinces  while germanicus was active in his administration  the governor of syria gnaeus calpurnius piso began feuding with him  during the feud  her husband died of illness on    october ad    

germanicus was cremated in antioch and she transported his ashes to rome where they were interred at the mausoleum of augustus  agrippina was vocal in claiming her husband was murdered to promote tiberius  son drusus julius caesar   drusus the younger   as heir  following the model of her grandmother livia  she spent the time following germanicus  death supporting the cause of her sons nero and drusus caesar  this put her and her sons at odds with the powerful praetorian prefect lucius aelius sejanus who would begin eliminating their supporters with accusations of treason and sexual misconduct in ad     her family s rivalry with sejanus would culminate with her and nero s exile in ad     nero was exiled to pontia and she was exiled to the island of pandateria  where she would remain until her death by starvation in ad    

following the roman custom of parents and children sharing the same nomen and cognomen  women in the same family would often share the same name  accordingly  marcus vipsanius agrippa had many relatives who shared the name  vipsania agrippina   to distinguish marcus agrippa s daughter from his granddaughter  historians refer to his daughter as latin  agrippina maior   literally  agrippina the elder   likewise  agrippina s daughter is referred to as  agrippina minor   literally  agrippina the younger   like her father  agrippina the elder avoided her cognomen and was never called  vipsania  

marcus vipsanius agrippa was an early supporter of augustus  then  octavius   during the final war of the roman republic that ensued as a result of the assassination of julius caesar in    bc  his father  lucius vipsanius agrippa  was a key general in augustus  armies  commanding troops in pivotal battles against mark antony and sextus pompeius  from early in the emperor s reign  agrippa was trusted to handle affairs in the eastern provinces and was even given the signet ring of augustus  who appeared to be on his deathbed in   bc  a sign that he would become  princeps  were augustus to die  it is probable that he was to rule until the emperor s nephew  marcus claudius marcellus  came of age  however  marcellus died that year of an illness that became an epidemic in rome 

now  with marcellus dead  augustus arranged for the marriage of agrippa to his daughter julia the elder  who was previously the wife of marcellus  agrippa was given  tribunicia potestas    the tribunician power   in    bc  a power that only the emperor and his immediate heir could hope to attain  the tribunician power allowed him to control the senate  and it was first given to julius caesar  agrippa acted as tribune in the senate to pass important legislation and  though he lacked some of the emperor s power and authority  he was approaching the position of co regent 

after the birth of agrippa s second son  lucius  in    bc  lucius and his brother gaius were adopted together by augustus  around the time of their adoption in the summer  augustus held the fifth ever  ludi saeculares    secular games    cassius dio says the adoption of the boys coupled with the games served to introduce a new era of peace     the  pax augusta   it is not known what agrippa thought of their adoption  however  following their adoption  agrippa was dispatched to govern the eastern provinces  bringing his family with him 

agrippina was born in    bc to marcus vipsanius agrippa and julia the elder  before their return to rome in    bc  she had five siblings  a half sister vipsania agrippina  three brothers  gaius  lucius  and postumus agrippa  all were adopted by augustus  gaius and lucius were adopted together following lucius  birth in    bc  postumus in ad     and a sister who shared the same mother  julia the younger 

she was a prominent member of the julio claudian dynasty  on her mother s side  she was the younger granddaughter of augustus  she was the sister in law of tiberius by her half sister s marriage to him  and of claudius  the brother of her husband germanicus  her son gaius  better known as  caligula   would be the fourth emperor  and her grandson nero would be the last emperor of the dynasty 

in    bc  her father returned to rome and was promptly sent to pannonia to suppress a rebellion  agrippa arrived there that winter  in    bc   but the pannonians gave up that same year  agrippa returned to campania in italy  where he fell ill and died soon after  after her father s death  she spent the rest of her childhood in augustus  household where access to her was strictly controlled 

some of the currency issued in         bc  the  aurei  and  denarii   make it clear that her brothers gaius and lucius were augustus  intended heirs  their father was no longer available to assume the reigns of power if the emperor were to die  and augustus had to make it clear who his intended heirs were in case anything should happen  lucius  and gaius  military and political careers would steadily advance until their deaths in ad   and    respectively 

the death of her brothers meant that augustus had to find other heirs  although he initially considered agrippina s second cousin germanicus a potential heir for a time  livia convinced augustus to adopt tiberius  livia s son from her first marriage with tiberius claudius nero  although augustus adopted tiberius  it was on condition that tiberius first adopt germanicus so that germanicus would become second in the line of succession  it was a corollary to the adoption  probably in the next year  that agrippina was married to germanicus 

by her husband germanicus  she had nine children  nero julius caesar  drusus julius caesar  tiberius julius caesar  a child of unknown name  normally referenced as  ignotus    gaius the elder  the emperor caligula  gaius the younger   the empress agrippina the younger  julia drusilla  and julia livilla  only six of his children came of age  tiberius and the ignotus died as infants  and gaius the elder in his early childhood 

her husband s career in the military began in ad    with the batonian war in pannonia and dalmatia  throughout germanicus  military career  agrippina is known to have traveled with her husband and their children  germanicus  career advanced steadily as he advanced in ranks following the  cursus honorum  until  in ad     he was made consul  the following year  he was given command over gaul and the forces on the rhine  totaling eight legions 

on    may ad     her one year old son gaius was sent by augustus from rome to join her in gaul  she was pregnant at the time and  while germanicus was collecting taxes across gaul  she remained at an unspecified separate location  presumably for her safety  augustus sent her a letter with her son s party  which read 
later that year  on    august  augustus died while away in campania  as a result  tiberius was made  princeps   while germanicus was administering the oath of fealty to tiberius  a mutiny began among the forces on the rhine  during the mutiny  agrippina brought out their sixth child  gaius  and made preparations to take him away to a safer town nearby  he was in a full army outfit including the legionary hobnailed boots   caligae    these military booties earned gaius the nickname  caligula   lit   little boots    and garnered sympathy for agrippina and the child among the soldiery  tacitus attributes her actions as having quelled the mutiny  tacitus   annals            

once the mutiny was put to an end  germanicus allowed the soldiers to deal with the ringleaders  which they did with brutal severity  he then led them against the germanic tribes  perhaps in an effort to prevent future mutiny  germanicus would remain in gaul fighting against the germanic tribes until ad     at which time he was recalled to rome by tiberius  his campaigns won him much renown among the roman people  and he was awarded a triumph on    may ad    

in ad     agrippina left for the eastern provinces with her family  germanicus was sent the east to govern the provinces  the same assignment her father was given years earlier  agrippina was pregnant on their journey east and  on the way to syria  she gave birth to her youngest daughter julia livilla on the island of lesbos  inscriptions celebrating her fertility have been found on the island 

tiberius sent gnaeus calpurnius piso to assist her husband  naming him governor of syria  during their time there  germanicus was active in his administration of the eastern regions  piso did not get along well with germanicus and their relationship only got worse  in ad     germanicus ordered piso to leave the province  which piso began to do  on his way back to rome  piso stopped at the island of kos off the coast of syria  around that time germanicus fell ill and he died on    october ad    at antioch  rumours spread of piso poisoning her husband on the emperor s orders 

after germanicus  cremation in the forum of antioch  agrippina personally carried the ashes of her husband to rome  the transportation of the ashes witnessed national mourning  she landed at the port of brundisium in southern italy where she was met with huge crowds of sympathizers  from brundisium  a praetorian escort was provided for her by the emperor in respect to her rank as the wife of a governor general  as she passed each town  the people and local magistrates came out to show their respect  drusus the younger  son of tiberius   claudius  and the consuls journeyed to join the procession as well  once she made it to rome  her husband s ashes were interred at the mausoleum of augustus  tiberius and livia did not make an appearance 

her marriage to germanicus had served to unite the imperial family  agrippina may have suspected tiberius  involvement in the death of her husband and  with germanicus dead  she no longer had any familial ties to the emperor  historian richard alston says it is likely that either tiberius or livia were behind the exile of agrippina s half sister and the death of postumus  he notes the death of agrippina s mother  who starved herself to death amidst her exile in ad     linking her death to tiberius  disdain for her 

agrippina was vocal about her feelings claiming that germanicus was murdered to promote drusus the younger as tiberius  heir  and worried that the birth of the younger drusus  twin sons would displace her own sons in the line of succession  her fears proved to be unfounded  with her son nero receiving the  toga virilis    toga of manhood   from tiberius and the younger drusus on   june ad     further  nero was promised the office of quaestor five years before the ordinary age and was wed to tiberius  granddaughter julia  agrippina s second oldest son drusus was given similar honors and was also promised the office of quaestor in advance when he reached his fourteenth year in ad    

at about this time  tiberius  praetorian prefect sejanus was becoming powerful in rome and began feuding with drusus the younger  while the exact causes of the feud are unknown  it ended when the younger drusus died of seemingly natural causes on    september ad     after the death of tiberius  son  agrippina wanted to advance the careers of her sons  who were all potential heirs for tiberius  to achieve this  agrippina presented the great cameo of france to tiberius  it was a personalized gift that positioned the family of germanicus around the emperor  the work was designed to convince tiberius to choose her children as his heirs  it is likely she was the one who commissioned the great cameo of france 

ultimately  the death of tiberius  son elevated her own children to the position of heirs  her sons were the logical choice  because they were the sons of germanicus and tiberius  grandsons were too young  nero was becoming popular in the senate due in part  tacitus says  to his resemblance with his father  the rise of her children was threatening to sejanus  position  resultantly  sejanus began spreading rumors about agrippina in the imperial court  the coming years were marked with increasing hostility between sejanus and agrippina and her sons  this effectively caused factions to rise in the aristocracy between her family and sejanus 

on new year s day  ad     sejanus had the priests and magistrates add prayers for the health of nero and drusus in addition to those normally offered to the emperor on that day  tiberius was not happy with this and he voiced his displeasure in the senate  in addition  he questioned the priests of the palatine  some of the priests who offered the prayers were relatives of agrippina and germanicus  this made tiberius suspicious of her and marked a change in his attitude toward her and her older sons  but not caligula 

in ad     sejanus requested livilla s hand in marriage  livilla was a niece of the emperor  which would have made him a member of the imperial family  while this did make his ambitions clear  his request was denied  the loss may have been huge for sejanus had the dissensions in the imperial household not been deteriorating  relations were so bad that agrippina refused to eat at tiberius  dinner parties for fear of being poisoned  she also asked tiberius if she could be allowed to remarry  which he also refused  

if either of them were allowed to remarry it would have threatened the line of succession that tiberius was comfortable with  by refusing sejanus  request  tiberius made it clear he was content with the children of germanicus and his own grandchildren being his successors  had sejanus married livilla  their children would have provided another line of possible successors  the implication of agrippina s request was that she needed a man from outside the imperial family to serve as protector and step father of possible imperial heirs  a powerful position  it was also an implied reprimand  tiberius was meant to be the guardian of the imperial family 

tiberius was in a tough position  he was faced with a conflict between his family and his friend  his solution was surprising  in ad     left rome altogether and retired to the island of capri in the bay of naples  he cut himself off from the factions altogether and abandoned politics  he left rome in the care of sejanus  this allowed sejanus to freely attack his rivals 

with tiberius away from rome  the city would see a rise of politically motivated trials on the part of sejanus and his supporters against agrippina and her associates  many of her friends and associates were subsequently accused of  maiestas    treason   by the growing number of accusers  it was also common to see charges of sexual misconduct and corruption  in ad     agrippina found herself placed under house arrest in her suburban villa outside herculaneum 

in ad     the senate voted that altars to  clementia   mercy  and  amicitia   friendship  be raised  at that time   clementia  was considered a virtue of the ruling class  for only the powerful could give clemency  the altar of  amicitia  was flanked by statues of sejanus and tiberius  by this time  his association with tiberius was such that there were those in roman society who erected statues in his honor and gave prayers and sacrifices in his honor  sejanus  birthday was honored as if he were a member of the imperial family  according to richard alston   sejanus  association with tiberius must have at least indicated to the people that he would be further elevated  

sejanus did not begin his final attack on agrippina until after the death of livia in ad     tacitus reports a letter being sent to the senate from tiberius denouncing agrippina for her arrogance and prideful attitude  and nero for engaging in shameful sexual activities  the senate would not begin highly unpopular prosecutions against her or her son until it received clear instructions from tiberius to do so  despite public outcry  agrippina and nero were declared public enemies   hostes   following a repeat of the accusations by the emperor  they were both exiled  nero to pontia where he was killed or encouraged to commit suicide in ad     and agrippina to the island of pandateria  the same place her mother was exiled to   

suetonius says that while on the island of pandateria  she lost an eye when she was beaten by a centurion  she would remain on the island until her death in ad     accounts of her death vary  she is said to have died from starvation  but it is not certain whether or not it was self imposed  tacitus says food was withheld from her in an effort to make her death seem like a suicide 

her son drusus was later also exiled on charges of sexual misdemeanors  sejanus remained powerful until his sudden downfall and summary execution in october ad     just after the death of nero  the exact cause for which remains unclear  alston suggests that sejanus may have been acting in tiberius  favor to remove germanicus  family from power  noting that agrippina and nero s brother drusus were left in exile even after sejanus  death 

the deaths of agrippina s older sons elevated her youngest son caligula to the position of successor and he became  princeps  when tiberius died in ad     drusus the younger s son tiberius gemellus was summoned to capri by his father tiberius  where he and caligula were made joint heirs  when caligula assumed power he made gemellus his adopted son  but caligula soon had gemellus killed for plotting against him 

after he became emperor  caligula took on the role of a dutiful son and brother in a public show of  pietas    piety    he went out to the islands of pontia and pandateria in order to recover the remains of agrippina and nero  it was not easy to recover nero s bones as they were scattered and buried  moreover  he had a stormy passage  however  the difficulty in his task made his devotion seem even greater  the ashes were brought to ostia  from where they were carried up the tiber and brought to the campus martius  from where equestrians placed them on briers to join the ashes of germanicus in the mausoleum of augustus  the move was reminiscent of when agrippina carried the ashes of her husband just over    years earlier  agrippina s funerary urn still survives    

agrippina was fiercely independent  a trait she shared with her mother  dio described her as having ambitions to match her pedigree  however  anthony barrett notes that agrippina was fully aware that a woman in ancient rome could not hold power in her own right  instead  agrippina followed the model of livia in promoting the careers of her children 

she and her daughter  agrippina the younger  are both described as being equally ambitious for their sons  whereas the elder agrippina s son failed to become emperor  the younger agrippina s son  also named nero  succeeds  in a contrast  tacitus has agrippina the elder merely standing on a bridge waving the soldiers passing by  whereas her daughter eclipses her by presiding over a military tribunal and accepting gifts from foreign ambassadors 

tacitus also records serious tension between agrippina and livia  he describes livia as having visited  stepmotherly provocations  on agrippina  he says of agrippina   were it not that through her moral integrity and love for her husband she converted an otherwise ungovernable temper to the good   tacitus   annals         despite being sympathetic to her as a victim of imperial oppression  he uses expressions like  excitable    arrogant    proud    fierce    obstinate   and  ambitious  to describe agrippina  his comments are echoed by other sources  

historian lindsay powell says agrippina enjoyed a normal marriage and continued to show her devotion to germanicus after his death  he says she was regarded by the roman people as  quoting tacitus   the glory of the country  the sole surviving offspring of augustus  the solitary example of the good old times  

alston cautions against accepting the stories of agrippina s feud with sejanus at face value  as these accounts reflect a tradition hostile to tiberius and sejnaus  they may have been circulated by agrippina s supporters or they may have emerged after sejanus  fall in ad     he adds   these stories are plausible  though not certain to be true  

augustus was proud of agrippina  suetonius claims that augustus wrote her a letter praising her intellect and directing her education  suetonius also records that augustus  who held strict views on self restraint and respectable speech  cautioned agrippina not to speak  offensively   when she next appears  she is being chastised by tiberius in greek for making irritating remarks  and the tone of the greek verse quoted by tiberius suggests that she should have heeded the advice of her grandfather not to speak offensively 

the  annals  of tacitus is a history of the julio claudian dynasty beginning with the death of augustus  in it  he portrays women as having a profound influence on politics  the women of the imperial family in particular are depicted by tacitus as having a notable prominence in the public sphere as well as possessing a ferocity and ambition with which they pursue it  tacitus presents them as living longer than the imperial men and thus being more wise as they advance in age  among the most broad of his portrayals is that of agrippina  he emphasizes their role in connecting genetically back to augustus  a significant factor in the marriages of the emperors and princes of the dynasty  the annals repeatedly has agrippina competing for influence with tacitus simply because she is related to augustus biologically 

tacitus presents agrippina as being kindred to aristocratic males  and has her reversing gender roles  which showcases her assumption of male  auctoritas    authority   with metaphors of her dressing and undressing  in an example of agrippina assuming  auctoritas   he says  

using the above epithet     femina  ingens animi        a woman   great for her courage    he assigns a haughty attitude to agrippina that compels her to explore the affairs of men  he records her as having reversed the natural order of things when she quelled the mutiny of the rhine in ad     in so doing  he describes her as having usurped her husband s power  a power rightfully belonging only to a general 

portraits of roman women from the julio claudian dynasty display a freer hair treatment then those of traditional roman men and are more keen on the sensitivity of recording on different textures  these changes in style served to make reproducing them more popular in the mid first century ad  reproductions of her image would continue to be made into that period  in the portrait  she is given a youthful face despite the fact that she lived to middle age  agrippina s hair is a mass of curls that covers both sides of her head and is long going down to her shoulders  her portraiture can be contrasted with that of livia who had a more austere augustan hairstyle 

there are three different periods during the first century ad when portraits were created for agrippina  at the time of her marriage to germanicus  which made her the mother of a potential emperor   when her son caligula came into power in ad     and collected her ashes from the island of pandateria for relocation to the mausoleum of augustus  and at the time of claudius  marriage to antonia minor  who wanted to connect himself to the lineage of augustus by evoking agrippina s image  coins and inscriptions cannot act as a method of discerning her age  because her hairstyle remains unchanged in all the representations 

the easiest phase of portraits to identify are those dating to the time of caligula  when a fair abundance of coins were minted with an image of his mother on them  it is a posthumous portrait of her with idealized features  in the phase following claudius  marriage  her features are made to more closely resemble those of her daughter  the goal was to strengthen agrippina the younger s connection with her mother  finally  the portraits of her dating to the time of tiberius are still idealized  but not as much as those from the period of caligula s reign  images of agrippina from this period are the most lifelike 

agrippina has been depicted in many works of art  the most notable of which include 






agrippina the younger

agrippina the younger  latin   julia agrippina     november ad           march ad      also referred to as agrippina minor   minor   which is latin for   the younger    was a roman empress and one of the more prominent women in the julio claudian dynasty  her father was germanicus  a popular general and one time heir apparent to the roman empire under tiberius  and her mother was agrippina the elder  a granddaughter of the first roman emperor augustus  she was also the younger sister of caligula  as well as the niece and fourth wife of claudius 

both ancient and modern sources describe agrippina s personality as ruthless  ambitious  violent  and domineering  physically she was a beautiful and reputable woman  according to pliny the elder  she had a double canine in her upper right jaw  a sign of good fortune  many ancient historians accuse agrippina of poisoning her husband claudius  though accounts vary  in ad    agrippina was executed on the orders of her son  the emperor nero 

agrippina was the first daughter and fourth living child of agrippina the elder and germanicus  she had three elder brothers  nero caesar  drusus caesar and the future emperor caligula  and two younger sisters  julia drusilla and julia livilla  agrippina s two elder brothers and her mother were victims of the intrigues of the praetorian prefect lucius aelius sejanus 

she was the namesake of her mother  agrippina the elder was remembered as a modest and heroic matron  who was the second daughter and fourth child of julia the elder and the statesman marcus vipsanius agrippa  the father of julia the elder was the emperor augustus  and julia was his only natural child from his second marriage to scribonia  who had close blood relations with pompey the great and lucius cornelius sulla  maternally  agrippina descended directly from augustus 

germanicus  agrippina s father  was a very popular general and politician  his mother was antonia minor and his father was the general nero claudius drusus  he was antonia minor s first child  germanicus had two younger siblings  a sister  named livilla  and a brother  the future emperor claudius  claudius was agrippina s paternal uncle and third husband 

antonia minor was a daughter to octavia the younger by her second marriage to triumvir mark antony  and octavia was the second eldest sister and full blooded sister of augustus  germanicus  father  drusus the elder  was the second son of the empress livia drusilla by her first marriage to praetor tiberius nero  and was the emperor tiberius s younger brother and augustus s stepson  in the year    augustus ordered and forced tiberius to adopt germanicus  who happened to be tiberius s nephew  as his son and heir  germanicus was a favorite of his great uncle augustus  who hoped that germanicus would succeed his uncle tiberius  who was augustus s own adopted son and heir  this in turn meant that tiberius was also agrippina s adoptive grandfather in addition to her paternal great uncle 

agrippina was born on   november in ad     or possibly     at oppidum ubiorum  a roman outpost on the rhine river located in present day cologne  germany  a second sister julia drusilla was born on    september     also in germany  as a small child  agrippina travelled with her parents throughout germany           until she and her siblings  apart from caligula  returned to rome to live with and be raised by their maternal grandmother antonia  her parents departed for syria in    to conduct official duties  and  according to tacitus  the third and youngest sister was born en route on the island of lesbos  namely julia livilla  probably in march     in october of ad     germanicus died suddenly in antioch  modern antakya  turkey  

germanicus  death caused much public grief in rome  and gave rise to rumors that he had been murdered by gnaeus calpurnius piso and munatia plancina on the orders of tiberius  as his widow agrippina the elder returned to rome with his ashes  agrippina the younger was thereafter supervised by her mother  her paternal grandmother antonia minor  and her great grandmother  livia  all of them notable  influential  and powerful figures from whom she learnt how to survive  she lived on the palatine hill in rome  her great uncle tiberius had already become emperor and the head of the family after the death of augustus in    

after her thirteenth birthday in     tiberius arranged for agrippina to marry her paternal first cousin once removed gnaeus domitius ahenobarbus and ordered the marriage to be celebrated in rome  domitius came from a distinguished family of consular rank  through his mother antonia major  domitius was a great nephew of augustus  first cousin to claudius  and first cousin once removed to agrippina and caligula  he had two sisters  domitia lepida the elder and domitia lepida the younger  domitia lepida the younger was the mother of the empress valeria messalina 

antonia major was the elder sister to antonia minor  and the first daughter of octavia minor and mark antony  according to suetonius  domitius was a wealthy man with a despicable and dishonest character  who  according to suetonius  was  a man who was in every aspect of his life detestable  and served as consul in     agrippina and domitius lived between antium  modern anzio and nettuno  and rome  not much is known about the relationship between them 

tiberius died on march     ad     and agrippina s only surviving brother  caligula  became the new emperor  being the emperor s sister gave agrippina some influence 

agrippina and her younger sisters julia drusilla and julia livilla received various honours from their brother  which included but were not limited to 


around the time that tiberius died  agrippina had become pregnant  domitius had acknowledged the paternity of the child  in the early morning hours in antium of december     agrippina gave birth to a son  agrippina and domitius named their son lucius domitius ahenobarbus  after the domitius  recently deceased father  this child would grow up to become the emperor nero  nero was agrippina s only natural child  suetonius states that domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son  whereupon he replied  i don t think anything produced by me and agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people  

caligula and his sisters were accused of having incestuous relationships  on june     ad     drusilla died  possibly of a fever  rampant in rome at the time  he was particularly fond of drusilla  claiming to treat her as he would his own wife  even though drusilla had a husband  following her death caligula showed no special love or respect toward the surviving sisters and was said to have gone insane 

in     agrippina and livilla  with their maternal cousin  drusilla s widower marcus aemilius lepidus  were involved in a failed plot to murder caligula  a plot known as the  plot of the three daggers   which was to make lepidus the new emperor  lepidus  agrippina and livilla were accused of being lovers  not much is known concerning this plot and the reasons behind it  at the trial of lepidus  caligula felt no compunction about denouncing them as adulteresses  producing handwritten letters discussing how they were going to kill him 

lepidus was executed  agrippina and livilla were exiled by their brother to the pontine islands  caligula sold their furniture  jewellery  slaves and freedmen  in january of ad     domitius died of edema  dropsy  at pyrgi  lucius had gone to live with his second paternal aunt domitia lepida the younger after caligula had taken his inheritance away from him 

caligula  his wife milonia caesonia and their daughter julia drusilla were murdered on january         agrippina s paternal uncle  claudius  brother of her father germanicus  became the new roman emperor 

claudius lifted the exiles of agrippina and livilla  livilla returned to her husband  while agrippina was reunited with her estranged son  after the death of her first husband  agrippina tried to make shameless advances to the future emperor galba  who showed no interest in her and was devoted to his wife aemilia lepida  on one occasion  galba s mother in law gave agrippina a public reprimand and a slap in the face before a whole bevy of married women 

claudius had lucius  inheritance reinstated  lucius became more wealthy despite his youth shortly after gaius sallustius crispus passienus divorced lucius  aunt  domitia lepida the elder  lucius  first paternal aunt  so that crispus could marry agrippina  they married  and crispus became a step father to lucius  crispus was a prominent  influential  witty  wealthy and powerful man  who served twice as consul  he was the adopted grandson and biological great great nephew of the historian sallust  little is known on their relationship  but crispus soon died and left his estate to nero 

in the first years of claudius  reign  claudius was married to the infamous empress valeria messalina  although agrippina was very influential  she kept a very low profile and stayed away from the imperial palace and the court of the emperor  messalina was agrippina s second paternal cousin  among the victims of messalina s intrigues were agrippina s surviving sister livilla  who was charged with having adultery with seneca the younger  seneca was later called back from exile to be a tutor to nero 

messalina considered agrippina s son a threat to her son s position and sent assassins to strangle lucius during his siesta  the assassins fled in terror when they saw a snake suddenly dart from beneath lucius  pillow   but it was only a sloughed off snake skin in his bed  near his pillow 

in     crispus died  and at his funeral  the rumor spread around that agrippina poisoned crispus to gain his estate  after being widowed a second time  agrippina was left very wealthy  later that year at the secular games  at the performance of the troy pageant  messalina attended the event with her son britannicus  agrippina was also present with lucius  agrippina and lucius received greater applause from the audience than messalina and britannicus did  many people began to show pity and sympathy to agrippina  due to the unfortunate circumstances in her life  agrippina wrote a memoir that recorded the misfortunes of her family  casus suorum  and wrote an account of her mother s life 

after messalina was executed in    for conspiring with gaius silius to overthrow her husband  claudius considered remarrying for the fourth time  around this time  agrippina became the mistress to one of claudius  advisers  the former greek freedman  marcus antonius pallas  at that time claudius  advisers were discussing which noblewoman claudius should marry  claudius had a reputation that he was easily persuaded  in more recent times  it has been suggested that the senate may have pushed for the marriage between agrippina and claudius to end the feud between the julian and claudian branches  this feud dated back to agrippina s mother s actions against tiberius after the death of germanicus  actions which tiberius had gladly punished 

claudius made references to her in his speeches   my daughter and foster child  born and bred  in my lap  so to speak   when claudius decided to marry her  he persuaded a group of senators that the marriage should be arranged in the public interest  in roman society  an uncle  claudius  marrying his niece  agrippina  was considered incestuous  and obviously immoral 

agrippina and claudius married on new year s day      this marriage caused widespread disapproval  this was a part of agrippina s scheming plan to make lucius the new emperor  her marriage to claudius was not based on love  but on power  she quickly eliminated her rival lollia paulina  shortly after marrying claudius  agrippina charged paulina with black magic  paulina did not receive a hearing  her property was confiscated  she left italy and  on agrippina s orders  committed suicide 

in the months leading up to her marriage to claudius  agrippina s maternal second cousin  the praetor lucius junius silanus torquatus  was betrothed to claudius  daughter claudia octavia  this betrothal was broken off in     when agrippina  scheming with the consul lucius vitellius the elder  the father of the future emperor aulus vitellius  falsely accused silanus of incest with his sister junia calvina  agrippina did this hoping to secure a marriage between octavia and her son  consequently  claudius broke off the engagement and forced silanus to resign from public office 

silanus committed suicide on the day that agrippina married her uncle  and calvina was exiled from italy in early     calvina was called back from exile after the death of agrippina  towards the end of     agrippina would order the murder of silanus  eldest brother marcus junius silanus torquatus without nero s knowledge  so that he would not seek revenge against her over his brother s death 

on the day that agrippina married her uncle claudius as her third husband his fourth wife  she became an empress and the most powerful woman in the roman empire  she also was a stepmother to claudia antonia  claudius  daughter and only child from his second marriage to aelia paetina  and to the young claudia octavia and britannicus  claudius  children with valeria messalina  agrippina removed or eliminated anyone from the palace or the imperial court who she thought was loyal and dedicated to the memory of the late messalina  she also eliminated or removed anyone who she considered was a potential threat to her position and the future of her son  one of her victims being lucius  second paternal aunt and messalina s mother domitia lepida the younger 

in     agrippina was seated on a dais at a parade of captives when their leader the celtic king caratacus bowed before her with the same homage and gratitude as he accorded the emperor  in     agrippina was granted the honorific title of augusta  she was only the third roman woman  livia drusilla and antonia minor received this title  and only the second living roman woman  the first being antonia  to receive this title 

also that year  claudius had founded a roman colony and called the colony  colonia claudia ara agrippinensis  or  agrippinensium   today known as cologne  after agrippina who was born there  this colony was the only roman colony to be named after a roman woman  in     she was given a  carpentum  which she used  a carpentum was a sort of ceremonial carriage usually reserved for priests  such as the vestal virgins  and sacred statues  that same year she appointed sextus afranius burrus as the head of the praetorian guard  replacing the previous head of the praetorian guard  rufrius crispinus 

ancient sources claim that agrippina successfully manipulated and influenced claudius into adopting her son and having him become his successor  lucius domitius ahenobarbus was adopted by his great maternal uncle and stepfather in     lucius  name was changed to  nero claudius caesar drusus germanicus  and he became claudius s adopted son  heir and recognised successor  agrippina and claudius betrothed nero to octavia  and agrippina arranged to have seneca the younger return from exile to tutor the future emperor  claudius chose to adopt nero because of his julian and claudian lineage 

agrippina deprived britannicus of his heritage and further isolated him from his father and succession for the throne in every way possible  for instance  in     agrippina ordered the execution of britannicus  tutor sosibius because he had confronted her and was outraged by claudius  adoption of nero and his choice of nero as successor  instead of choosing his own son britannicus 

nero and octavia were married on june        claudius later repented of marrying agrippina and adopting nero  began to favor britannicus  and started preparing him for the throne  his actions allegedly gave agrippina a motive to eliminate claudius  the ancient sources say she poisoned claudius on october        with a plate of deadly mushrooms at a banquet  thus enabling nero to quickly take the throne as emperor  accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident and according to more modern sources  it is possible  but exceedingly convenient  that claudius died of natural causes  claudius was    years old 

agrippina was named a priestess of the cult of the deified claudius  she was allowed to visit senate meetings  watching and hearing the meetings from behind a curtain  

in the first months of nero s reign agrippina controlled her son and the empire  she lost control over nero when he began to have an affair with the freed woman claudia acte  which agrippina strongly disapproved of and violently scolded him for  agrippina began to support britannicus in her attempt to make him emperor  britannicus was secretly poisoned on nero s orders during his own banquet in february     the power struggle between agrippina and her son had begun  

agrippina between    and    became very watchful and had a critical eye over her son  in     agrippina was forced out of the palace by her son to live in imperial residence  nero deprived his mother of all honors and powers  and even removed her roman and german bodyguards  nero even threatened his mother he would abdicate the throne and would go to live on the greek island of rhodes  a place where tiberius had lived after divorcing julia the elder  pallas also was dismissed from the court  the fall of pallas and the opposition of burrus and seneca  contributed to agrippina s loss of authority 

towards     agrippina was expelled from the palace and went to live in a riverside estate in misenum  while agrippina lived there or when she went on short visits to rome  nero sent people to annoy her  although living in misenum  she was still very popular  powerful and influential  agrippina and nero would see each other on short visits  

the circumstances that surround agrippina s death are uncertain due to historical contradictions and anti nero bias  all surviving stories of agrippina s death contradict themselves and each other  and are generally fantastical 

according to tacitus  in     nero became involved with the noble woman poppaea sabina  with the reasoning that a divorce from octavia and a marriage to poppaea was not politically feasible with agrippina alive  nero decided to kill agrippina  yet  nero did not marry poppaea until     calling into question this motive  additionally  suetonius reveals that poppaea s husband  otho  was not sent away by nero until after agrippina s death in     making it highly unlikely that already married poppaea would be pressing nero  some modern historians theorize that nero s decision to kill agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set gaius rubellius plautus  nero s maternal second cousin  or britannicus  claudius  biological son  on the throne 

tacitus claims that nero considered poisoning or stabbing her  but felt these methods were too difficult and suspicious  so he settled on     after the advice of his former tutor anicetus     building a self sinking boat  though aware of the plot  agrippina embarked on this boat and was nearly crushed by a collapsing lead ceiling only to be saved by the side of a sofa breaking the ceiling s fall  though the collapsing ceiling missed agrippina  it crushed her attendant who was outside by the helm 

the boat failed to sink from the lead ceiling  so the crew then sank the boat  but agrippina swam to shore  her friend  acerronia polla  was attacked by oarsmen while still in the water  and was either bludgeoned to death or drowned  since she was exclaiming that she was agrippina  with the intention of being saved  she did not know  however  that this was an assassination attempt  not a mere accident  agrippina was met at the shore by crowds of admirers  news of agrippina s survival reached nero so he sent three assassins to kill her 

suetonius says that agrippina s  over watchful  and  over critical  eye she kept over nero drove him to murdering her  after months of attempting to humiliate her by depriving her of her power  honour and her bodyguard  he also expelled her from the palantine followed by the people he sent to  pester  her with lawsuits give her  jeers and catcalls   

when he eventually turned to murder  he first tried poison  three times in fact  she prevented her death by taking the antidote in advance  afterwards  he rigged up a machine in her room which would drop her ceiling tiles onto her as she slept  however  she once again escaped her death after she received word of the plan  nero s  final plan was to get her in a boat which would collapse and sink  

he sent her a friendly letter asking to reconcile and inviting her to celebrate the quinquatrus at baiae with him  he arranged an  accidental  collision between her galley and one of his captains  when returning home  he offered her his collapsible boat  as opposed to her damaged galley  

the next day  nero received word of her survival after the boat sank from her freedman agermus  panicking  nero ordered a guard to  surreptitiously  drop a blade behind agermus and nero immediately had him arrested on account of attempted murder  nero ordered the assassination of agrippina  he made it look as if agrippina had committed suicide after her plot to kill nero had been uncovered  

after agrippina s death  suetonius says that nero examined agrippina s corpse and discussed her good and bad points  

it is said that nero believed agrippina to haunt him after her death 

the tale of cassius dio is also somewhat different  it starts again with poppaea as the motive behind the murder  nero designed a ship that would open at the bottom while at sea  agrippina was put aboard and after the bottom of the ship opened up  she fell into the water  agrippina swam to shore so nero sent an assassin to kill her  nero then claimed agrippina plotted to kill him and committed suicide  her reputed last words  uttered as the assassin was about to strike  were  smite my womb   the implication here being she wished to be destroyed first in that part of her body that had given birth to so  abominable a son  

after agrippina s death  nero viewed her corpse and commented how beautiful she was  according to some  her body was cremated that night on a dining couch  at his mother s funeral  nero was witless  speechless and rather scared  when the news spread that agrippina had died  the roman army  senate and various people sent him letters of congratulations that he had been saved from his mother s plots 

during the remainder of nero s reign  agrippina s grave was not covered or enclosed  her household later on gave her a modest tomb in misenum  nero would have his mother s death on his conscience  he felt so guilty he would sometimes have nightmares about his mother  he even saw his mother s ghost and got persian magicians to scare her away  years before she died  agrippina had visited astrologers to ask about her son s future  the astrologers had rather accurately predicted that her son would become emperor and would kill her  she replied   let him kill me  provided he becomes emperor   according to tacitus 







 




american chinese cuisine

american chinese cuisine is a style of chinese cuisine developed by americans of chinese descent  the dishes served in many north american chinese restaurants are adapted to american tastes and often differ significantly from those found in china  

chinese immigrants arrived in the united states to work as miners and railroad workers  as the large groups of chinese immigrants arrived  laws were put in place preventing them from owning land  they mostly lived together in ghettos  individually referred to as  chinatown   here the immigrants started their own small businesses  including restaurants and laundry services  by the   th century  the chinese community in san francisco operated sophisticated and sometimes luxurious restaurants patronized mainly by chinese  the restaurants in smaller towns  mostly owned by chinese immigrants  served food based on what their customers requested  anything ranging from pork chop sandwiches and apple pie  to beans and eggs  many of these small town restaurant owners were self taught family cooks who improvised on different cooking methods and ingredients  these smaller restaurants were responsible for developing american chinese cuisine  where the food was modified to suit a more american palate  first catering to miners and railroad workers  they established new eateries in towns where chinese food was completely unknown  adapting local ingredients and catering to their customers  tastes  even though the new flavors and dishes meant they were not strictly chinese cuisine  these chinese restaurants have been cultural ambassadors to americans 

chinese restaurants in the united states began during the california gold rush  which brought twenty to thirty thousand immigrants across from the canton  guangdong  region of china  by       there were five restaurants in san francisco  soon after  significant amounts of food were being imported from china to america s west coast  the trend spread eastward with the growth of the american railways  particularly to new york city  the chinese exclusion act allowed merchants to enter the country  and in      restaurant owners became eligible for merchant visas  this fueled the opening of chinese restaurants as an immigration vehicle    the united states had        chinese restaurants 

along the way  cooks adapted southern chinese dishes such as chop suey and developed a style of chinese food not found in china  restaurants  along with chinese laundries  provided an ethnic niche for small businesses at a time when the chinese people were excluded from most jobs in the wage economy by ethnic discrimination or lack of language fluency  by the     s  this cuisine  particularly chop suey  became popular among middle class americans  however  after world war ii it began to be dismissed for not being  authentic   late   th century tastes have been more accommodating  take away food became popular amongst americans  chinese food becoming a favourite  take out  option  by this time it became evident that chinese restaurants no longer catered mainly for chinese customers 
there has been a consequential component of chinese emigration of illegal origin  most notably fuzhou people from fujian province and wenzhounese from zhejiang province in mainland china  specifically destined to work in chinese restaurants in new york city  beginning in the     s  adapting chinese cooking techniques to local produce and tastes has led to the development of american chinese cuisine  many of the chinese restaurant menus in the u s  are printed in chinatown  manhattan  which has a strong chinese american demographic 

with the continuing success of american chinese cuisine  including its portrayal to mainland chinese audiences through the medium of american television sitcoms  american chinese restaurants have opened in china itself  products and ingredients needed to recreate these adapted dishes are imported into china  they include  philadelphia cream cheese  skippy peanut butter  cornflakes and english mustard powder   

in       the smithsonian national museum of american history displayed some of the historical background and cultural artefacts of american chinese cuisine in its exhibit entitled   sweet   sour  a look at the history of chinese food in the united states  

american chinese food builds from styles and food habits brought from the southern province of guangdong  often from the toisan district of toisan  the origin of most chinese immigration before the closure of immigration from china in       these chinese families developed new styles and used readily available ingredients  especially in california  the type of chinese american cooking served in restaurants was different from the foods eaten in chinese american homes  of the various regional cuisines in china  cantonese cuisine has been the most influential in the development of american chinese food  especially that of toisan  the origin of most early immigrants 

among the common differences is to treat vegetables as a side dish or garnish  while traditional cuisines of china emphasize vegetables  this can be seen in the use of carrots and tomatoes  cuisine in china makes frequent use of asian leaf vegetables like bok choy and kai lan and puts a greater emphasis on fresh meat and seafood 
stir frying  pan frying  and deep frying tend to be the most common chinese cooking techniques used in american chinese cuisine  which are all easily done using a wok  a chinese frying pan with bowl like features and which accommodates very high temperatures   the food also has a reputation for high levels of msg to enhance the flavor  market forces and customer demand have encouraged many restaurants to offer  msg free  or  no msg  menus  or to omit this ingredient on request 
american chinese cuisine makes use of ingredients not native to and very rarely used in china  one such example is the common use of western broccoli    instead of chinese broccoli  gai lan    in american chinese cuisine  occasionally  western broccoli is also referred to as    in cantonese    in order not to confuse the two styles of broccoli  among chinese speakers  however  it is typically understood that one is referring to the leafy vegetable unless otherwise specified 

this is also the case with the words for carrot   luo buo  or  lo baak   or  hong luo buo    hong  meaning  red   and onion   yang cong     lo baak   in cantonese  refers to a large  pungent white radish  the orange western carrot is known in some areas of china as  foreign radish   or more properly  hung lo baak  in cantonese   hung  meaning  red    when the word for onion   cong   is used  it is understood that one is referring to  green onions   otherwise known to english speakers as  scallions  or  spring onions    the larger  many layered onion bulb common in the united states is called  yang cong   this translates as  western onion   these names make it evident that the american broccoli  carrot  and onion are not indigenous to china  and therefore are less common in the traditional cuisines of china 

egg fried rice in american chinese cuisine is also prepared differently  with more soy sauce added for more flavor whereas the traditional egg fried rice uses less soy sauce  some food styles  such as dim sum  were also modified to fit american palates  such as added batter for fried dishes and extra soy sauce 

salads containing raw or uncooked ingredients are rare in traditional chinese cuisine  as are japanese style sushi or sashimi  however  an increasing number of american chinese restaurants  including some upscale establishments  have started to offer these items in response to customer demand 

ming tsai  the owner of the blue ginger restaurant in wellesley  massachusetts  and host of pbs culinary show  simply ming   said that american chinese restaurants typically try to have food representing     regions of china at one time  have chop suey  or have  fried vegetables and some protein in a thick sauce    eight different sweet and sour dishes   or  a whole page of    different chow meins or fried rice dishes   tsai said  chinese american cuisine is  dumbed down  chinese food  it   s adapted    to be blander  thicker and sweeter for the american public  

most american chinese establishments cater to non chinese customers with menus written in english or containing pictures  if separate chinese language menus are available  they typically feature items such as liver  chicken feet  or other meat dishes that might deter american customers  in chinatown  manhattan  the restaurants were known for having a  phantom  menu with food preferred by ethnic chinese  but believed to be disliked by non chinese americans 

dishes that often appear on american chinese restaurant menus include 


authentic restaurants with chinese language menus may offer  yellow hair chicken      essentially a free range chicken  as opposed to typical american mass farmed chicken  yellow hair chicken is valued for its flavor  but needs to be cooked properly to be tender due to its lower fat and higher muscle content  this dish usually does not appear on the english language menu 

dau miu    is a chinese vegetable that has become popular since the early     s  and now not only appears on english language menus  usually as  pea shoots   but is often served by upscale non asian restaurants as well  originally it was only available during a few months of the year  but it is now grown in greenhouses and is available year round 

given that the new york city metropolitan area has become home to the largest overseas chinese population outside of asia  all popular styles of regional chinese cuisine have commensurately become ubiquitously accessible in new york city  including hakka  taiwanese  shanghainese  hunanese  szechuan  cantonese  fujianese  xinjiang  zhejiang  and korean chinese cuisine  even the relatively obscure dongbei style of cuisine indigenous to northeast china is now available in flushing  queens  as well as mongolian cuisine and uyghur cuisine  the availability of the regional variations of chinese cuisine originating from throughout the different provinces of china is most apparent in the city s chinatowns in queens  particularly the flushing chinatown                    but is also notable in the city s chinatowns in brooklyn and manhattan  

kosher preparation of chinese food is also widely available in new york city  given the metropolitan area s large jewish and particularly orthodox jewish populations the perception that american jews eat at chinese restaurants on christmas day is documented in media as a common stereotype with a basis in fact  the tradition may have arisen from the lack of other open restaurants on christmas day  as well as the close proximity of jewish and chinese immigrants to each other in new york city  and the absence of dairy foods combined with meat  kosher chinese food is usually prepared in new york city  as well as in other large cities with orthodox jewish neighborhoods  under strict rabbinical supervision as a prerequisite for kosher certification

since the early     s  many american chinese restaurants influenced by california cuisine have opened in the san francisco bay area  the trademark dishes of american chinese cuisine remain on the menu  but there is more emphasis on fresh vegetables  and the selection is vegetarian friendly  this new cuisine has exotic ingredients like mangos and portobello mushrooms  brown rice is often offered as an alternative to white rice  some restaurants substitute grilled wheat flour tortillas for the rice pancakes in mu shu dishes  this occurs even in some restaurants that would not otherwise be identified as california chinese  both the more westernized places and the more authentic places  there is a mexican bakery that sells some restaurants thinner tortillas made for use with mu shu  mu shu purists do not always react positively to this trend 

in addition  many restaurants serving more native style chinese cuisines exist  due to the high numbers and proportion of ethnic chinese in the san francisco bay area  restaurants specializing in cantonese  sichuanese  hunanese  northern chinese  shanghainese  taiwanese  and hong kong traditions are widely available  as are more specialized restaurants such as seafood restaurants  hong kong style diners and cafes  also known as  cha chaan teng      dim sum teahouses  and hot pot restaurants  many chinatown areas also feature chinese bakeries  boba milk tea shops  roasted meat  vegetarian cuisine  and specialized dessert shops  chop suey is not widely available in san francisco  and the area s chow mein is different from midwestern chow mein 

chinese american cuisine in the greater los angeles area is generally characterized by suburban settings  chinese restaurants in the san gabriel valley tend to concentrate on the preparation of taiwanese cuisine 

chinese cuisine in boston reflects a m  lange of multiple influential factors  the growing boston chinatown accommodates chinese owned bus lines shuttling an increasing number of passengers to and from the numerous chinatowns in new york city  and this has led to some commonalities in the local chinese cuisine derived from chinese food in new york  a large immigrant fujianese immigrant population has made a home in boston  leading to fuzhou cuisine being readily available in boston  an increasing vietnamese population has also been exerting an influence on chinese cuisine in greater boston  finally  innovative dishes incorporating chow mein and chop suey as well as locally farmed produce and regionally procured seafood ingredients are found in chinese as well as non chinese food in and around boston 

the evolving american chinese scene in philadelphia exhibits commonalities with the chinese cuisine scenes in both new york city and boston  there is a growing fujianese community in philadelphia as well  and fuzhou cuisine is readily available in the philadelphia chinatown  like boston  the emerging vietnamese cuisine scene in philadelphia is contributing to the milieu of chinese cuisine 

hawaiian chinese food developed somewhat differently from chinese cuisine in the continental united states  owing to the diversity of pacific ethnicities in hawaii and the history of the chinese influence in hawaii  resident chinese cuisine forms a component of the cuisine of hawaii  which is a fusion of different culinary traditions  some chinese dishes are typically served as part of plate lunches in hawaii  the names of foods are different as well  such as  manapua   from the hawaiian contraction of  mea ono pua a  or  delicious pork item  from the dim sum  bao   though the meat is not necessarily pork 



many american films   the godfather         ghostbusters        paid in full        love   other drugs        inside out        involve scenes where chinese take out food is eaten from oyster pails  a  consistent choice of cuisine in all these cases  however  might just be an indicator of its popularity   a running gag in  dallas  is cliff barnes  fondness for inexpensive chinese take out food  as opposed to nemesis j r  ewing frequenting fine restaurants 

among the numerous american television series and films that feature chinese restaurants as a setting include  seinfeld   particularly the episode  the chinese restaurant     year of the dragon    lethal weapon      mickey blue eyes    rush hour     and  men in black     in most cases it is not an actual restaurant but a movie set that typifies the stereotypical american chinese eatery  featuring  paper lanterns and intricate woodwork   with  numerous fish tanks and detailed  red  wallpaper  with gold designs   and  golden dragons   plus  hanging ducks in the window  







ahenobarbus

ahenobarbus was a  cognomen  used by a plebeian branch of the  gens domitia  in the late roman republic and early empire  the name means  red beard   literally   bronze beard   in latin  according to legend  castor and pollux announced to one of their ancestors the victory of the romans over the latins at the battle of lake regillus  and  to confirm the truth of what they had just said  they stroked his black hair and beard  which immediately became red

ahmad shah durrani

ahmad sh  h durr  n    c               october        pashto                               also known as ahmad kh  n abd  l       was the founder of the durrani empire and is regarded as the founder of the modern state of afghanistan  he began his career by enlisting as a young soldier in the military of the afsharid kingdom and quickly rose to become a commander of the abdali regiment  a cavalry of four thousand abdali pashtun soldiers 

after the assassination of nader shah afshar in       ahmad shah durrani was chosen as king of afghanistan  rallying his afghan tribes and allies  he pushed east towards the mughal and the maratha empires of india  west towards the disintegrating afsharid empire of persia  and north toward the khanate of bukhara  within a few years  he extended his control from khorasan in the west to kashmir and north india in the east  and from the amu darya in the north to the arabian sea in the south 

durrani s mausoleum is located at kandahar  afghanistan  adjacent to the shrine of the cloak in the center of the city  afghans often refer to him as  ahmad sh  h b  b      ahmad shah the father   

durrani was born in or about      to mohammad zaman khan  chief of the abdali tribe and governor of herat  and zarghuna alakozai  according to the  encyclopedia of islam  and most other sources  he was born in multan  however  according to  encyclopedia britannica online   there has been some debate about durrani s exact place of birth  and they state he was either born in multan or herat  

durrani was born as ahmed khan  abdali s father suffered  persian captivity for many years  at kirman before being released from prison in       as a refugee  he  made his way to india  and joined his kinsmen at multan  after he raised his family there  he was recognized as the  scion of hereditary sadozai chiefs   it is believed that zaman khan returned to afghanistan to fight the persians and his afghan rivals  but left one of his wives at multan because she was  in the family way   so other sources believe that  abdali was born at multan in       after which she returned to afghanistan to reunite with her husband  he lost his father during his infancy 

durrani s forefathers were sadozais but his mother was from the alakozai tribe  in june       the abdali forces under zulfiqar had surrendered to nader shah afshar  the rising new ruler of persia  however  they soon began a rebellion and took over herat as well as mashad  in july       he defeated ibrahim khan  a military commander and brother of nader shah  this prompted nader shah to retake mashad and also intervene in the power struggle of harat  by july       zulfiqar returned to his capital farah where he had been serving as the governor since       a year later nadir s brother ibrahim khan took control of farah  during this time zulfiqar and the young durrani fled to kandahar where they took refuge with the ghiljis  they were later made political prisoners by hussain hotak  the ghilji ruler of the kandahar region 

nader shah had been enlisting the abdalis in his army since around       after conquering kandahar in       durrani and his brother zulfiqar were freed and provided with leading careers in nader shah s administration  zulfiqar was made governor of mazandaran while durrani remained working as nader shah s personal attendant  the ghiljis  who are originally from the territories east of the kandahar region  were expelled from kandahar in order to resettle the abdalis along with some qizilbash and other persians 

durrani proved himself in nader shah s service and was promoted from a personal attendant   yas  wal   to command the abdali regiment  a cavalry of four thousand soldiers and officers  the abdali regiment was part of nader shah s military during his invasion of the mughal empire in      

popular history has it that the shah could see the talent in his young commander  later on  according to pashtun legend  it is said that in delhi nader shah summoned durrani  and said   come forward ahmad abdali  remember ahmad khan abdali  that after me the kingship will pass on to you  nader shah recruited him because of his  impressive personality and valour  also because of his  loyalty to the persian monarch  

nader shah s rule abruptly ended in june      when he was assassinated by his own guards  the guards involved in the assassination did so secretly so as to prevent the abdalis from coming to their king s rescue  however  durrani was told that the shah had been killed by one of his wives  despite the danger of being attacked  the abdali contingent led by durrani rushed either to save the shah or to confirm what happened  upon reaching the shah s tent  they were only to see his body and severed head  having served him so loyally  the abdalis wept at having failed their leader  and headed back to kandahar  before the retreat to kandahar  he had  removed  the royal seal from nader shah s finger and the koh i noor diamond tied  around the arm of his deceased master   on their way back to kandahar  the abdalis had  unanimously accepted  durrani as their new leader  hence he  assumed the insignia of royalty  as the  sovereign ruler of afghanistan  
one of durrani s first acts as chief was to adopt the titles  padishah i ghazi    victorious emperor    and  durr i durrani    pearl of pearls  or  pearl of the age   

following his predecessor  durrani set up a special force closest to him consisting mostly of his fellow durranis and other pashtuns  as well as tajiks  qizilbash and other muslims  he began his military conquest by capturing ghazni from the ghiljis and then wresting kabul from the local ruler  and thus strengthened his hold over khorasan  leadership of the various afghan tribes rested mainly on the ability to provide booty for the clan  and durrani proved remarkably successful in providing both booty and occupation for his followers  apart from invading the punjab region three times between the years              he captured herat in      

abdali invaded the mughal empire seven times from      to       according to jaswant lal mehta  durrani aroused the afghans  religious passions  to fire and  sword into the land of infidels india   he crossed the khyber pass in december      with        troops for his first invasion of india  he occupied peshawar without any opposition  he first crossed the indus river in       the year after his ascension      his forces sacked and absorbed lahore  the following year         the mughal ruler was induced to cede sindh and all of the punjab including the vital trans indus river to him  in order to save his capital from being attacked by the forces of the durrani empire  having thus gained substantial territories to the east without a fight  durrani and his forces turned westward to take possession of herat  which was ruled by nader shah s grandson  shah rukh  the city fell to the afghans in       after almost a year of siege and bloody conflict  the afghan forces then pushed on into present day iran  capturing nishapur and mashhad in       durrani then pardoned shah rukh and reconstituted khorasan  but a tributary of the durrani empire  this marked the westernmost border of the afghan empire as set by the pul i abrisham  on the mashhad tehran road 

the mughal power in northern india had been declining since the reign of aurangzeb  who died in       in            the  ahamdiya  treaty was signed between the marathas and mughals  when balaji bajirao was the peshwa of the maratha empire  through this treaty  the marathas controlled large parts of india from their capital at pune and mughal rule was restricted only to delhi  mughals remained the nominal heads of delhi   marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the northwest of india  durrani sacked the mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted  to counter the afghans  peshwa balaji bajirao sent raghunathrao  he succeeded in ousting timur shah and his court from india and brought northwest of india up to peshawar under maratha rule  thus  upon his return to kandahar in       durrani chose to return to india and confront the maratha forces to regain northwestern part of the subcontinent 

in       durrani set out on his campaign to win back lost territories  the early skirmishes ended in victory for the afghans against the maratha garrisons in northwest india  by       durrani and his army had reached lahore and were poised to confront the marathas  by       the maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of sadashivrao bhau  once again  panipat was the scene of a battle for control of northern india  the third battle of panipat was fought between durrani s afghan forces and the maratha forces in january       and resulted in a decisive durrani victory  this brought punjab till north of sutlej river under afghan control  ahmad shah durrani vacated delhi soon after the battle 

the historical area of what is modern day xinjiang consisted of the distinct areas of the tarim basin and dzungaria  and was originally populated by indo european tocharian and eastern iranian saka peoples who practiced the buddhist religion  the area was subjected to turkification and islamification at the hands of invading turkic muslims  both the buddhist turkic uyghurs and muslim turkic karluks participated in the turkification and conquest of the native buddhist indo european inhabitants of the tarim basin  the turkic muslims then proceeded to conquer the turkic buddhists in islamic holy wars and converted them to islam  the mixture between the invading mongoloid turkic peoples and the native caucasian indo european inhabitants resulted in the modern day turkic speaking hybrid europoid east asian inhabitants of xinjiang  the turkification was carried out in the  th and   th centuries by two different turkic kingdoms  the buddhist uyghur kingdom of qocho and the muslim karluk kara khanid khanate  halfway in the   th century the saka iranic buddhist kingdom of khotan came under attack by the turkic muslim karakhanid ruler musa  and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the turkification and islamification of the tarim basin  the karakhanid leader yusuf qadir khan conquered khotan around      

professor james a  millward described the original uyghurs as physically mongoloid  giving as an example the images in bezeklik at temple   of the uyghur patrons  until they began to mix with the tarim basin s original eastern iranian inhabitants  the modern uyghurs are now a mixed hybrid of east asian and europoid populations 

the turkic muslim sedentary people of the tarim basin of altishahr were originally ruled by the chagatai khanate while the nomadic buddhist dzungar oirats in dzungaria ruled over the dzungar khanate  the naqshbandi sufi khojas  descendants of the prophet muhammad  had replaced the chagatayid khans as the ruling authority of the tarim basin in the early   th century  there was a struggle between two factions of khojas  the afaqi  white mountain  faction and the ishaqi  black mountain  faction  the ishaqi defeated the afaqi  which resulted in the afaqi khoja inviting the  th dalai lama  the leader of the tibetan buddhists  to intervene on his behalf in       the  th dalai lama then called upon his dzungar buddhist followers in the zunghar khanate to act on this invitation  the dzungar khanate then conquered the tarim basin in       setting up the afaqi khoja as their puppet ruler 

khoja afaq asked the  th dalai lama when he fled to lhasa to help his afaqi faction take control of the tarim basin  kashgaria   the dzungar leader galdan was then asked by the dalai lama to restore khoja afaq as ruler of kashgararia  khoja afaq collaborated with galdan s dzungars when the dzungars conquered the tarim basin from             and set up the afaqi khojas as puppet client rulers  the dalai lama blessed galdan s conquest of the tarim basin and turfan basin 

since      the dzungars had ruled as suzerain masters over the tarim  for    more years using the chagatai as their puppet rulers  the dzungars used a hostage arrangement to rule over the tarim basin  keeping as hostsges in ili either the sons of the leaders like the khojas and khans or the leaders themselves  although the uighur s culture and religion was left alone  the dzungars substantially exploited them economically   the uighurs were forced with multiple taxes by the dzungars which were burdensome and set by a determined amount  and which they did not even have the ability to pay  they included water conservancy tax  draught animal tax  fruit tax  poll tax  land tax  tress and grass tax  gold and silver tax  and trade tax  annually the dzungars extracted a tax of        tangas of silver from the kashgar people in galdan tseren s reign  a five percent tax was imposed on foreign traders and a ten percent tax imposed on muslim merchants  people had to pay a fruit tax if they owned orchards and merchants had to pay a copper and silver tax  annually the dzungars extracted         silver tangas in tax from yarkand and slapped livestock  stain  commerce  and a gold tax on them  the dzungars extracted     taels of gold  and also extracted cotton  copper  and cloth  from the six regions of keriya  kashgar  khotan  kucha  yarkand  and aksu as stated by russian topographer yakoff filisoff  the dzungars extracted over     of the wheat harvests of muslims according to qi yi shi  chun yuan            of the wheat harvests of muslims according to the xiyu tuzhi  which labelled the tax as  plunder  of the muslims  the dzungars also extorted extra taxes on cotton  silver  gold  and traded goods from the muslims besides making them pay the official tax   wine  meat  and women  and  a parting gift  were forcibly extracted from the uighurs daily by the dzungars who went to physically gather the taxes from the uighur muslims  and if they dissatisfied with what they received  they would rape women  and loot and steal property and livestock  gold necklaces  diamonds  pearls  and precious stones from india were extracted from the uighurs under d  niy  l khoja by tsewang rabtan when his daughter was getting married 

       patman  each patman is   piculs and   pecks  of grain        silver ounces were forced to be paid yearly by kashgar to the dzungars and cash was also paid by the rest of the cities to the dzungars  trade  milling  and distilling taxes  corv  e labor  saffron  cotton  and grain were also extracted by the dzungars from the tarim basin  every harvest season  women and food had to be provided to dzungars when they came to extract the taxes from them 

when the dzungars levied the traditional nomadic alban poll tax upon the muslims of altishahr  the muslims viewed it as the payment of jizyah  a tax traditionally taken from non muslims by muslim conquerors  

the qing defeat of the dzungars went hand in hand with the anti dzungar resistance of the ordinary uighurs   many of them  unable to bear their misery  which was like living in a sea of fire  fled but were not able to find a place to settle peacefully   the uighurs carried out  acts of resistance  like hiding the goods which were collected as taxes or violently resisting the dzungar oirat tax collectors  but these incidents were infrequent and widespread anti dzungar opposition failed to materialize  many opponents of dzungar rule like uighurs and some dissident dzungars escaped and defected to qing china during             and provided the qing with intelligence on the dzungars and voiced their grievances   abdull  h tarkh  n beg and his hami uighurs defected and submitted to qing china after the qing inflicted a devastating defeat at chao mo do on the dzungar leader galdan in september       the uighur leader emin khoja  am  n khoja  of turfan revolted against the dzungars in      while the dzungars under tsewang rabtan were being attacked by the qing  and then he also defected and submitted to the qing  the uighurs in kashgar under y  suf and his older brother jah  n khoja of yarkand revolted in      against the dzungars  but jah  n was taken prisoner by the dzungars after he was betrayed by the uch turfan uighur xi bo ke khoja and aksu uighur ayy  b khoja  kashgar and yarkand were assaulted by       khotan uighurs under s  diq  the son of jah  n khoja  the uighurs supported the      qing assault against the dzungars in ili  which occurred at the same time as the uighur revolts against the dzungars  uighurs like emin khoja   abdu l mu min and y  suf beg supported the qing attack against dawachi  the dzungar khan  the uch turfan uighurnbeg khojis  huojisi  supported the qing general ban di against in tricking davachi and taking him prisoner  the qing and amin khoja and his sons worked together to defeat the dzungars under amursana 

from the   th century to the middle of the   th century  between china proper and transoxania  all the land was under the sway of the dzungars  in semirechye the kyrgyz and kazakahs were forcibly driven out by the dzungars and the kashgar khanate was conquered  however  the dzungar empire was annihilated by qing china from             in a formidable assault  ending the central asian states danger from the dzungar menace  uighur muslims like emin khoja from turfan revolted against their dzungar buddhist rulers and pledged alleigance to qing china to deliver them from dzungar buddhist rule  the qing crushed and annihilated the dzungars in the dzungar genocide 

the dzungar buddhists brought back the aqtaghliq afaqi khoja burhan ud din and his brother khan khoja and installed them as puppet rulers in kashgar  during the qing s war against the dzungars  burhan ud din and his brother khan khoja then pledged alleigance to qing china in exchange for delivering them from dzungar rule  however  after the qing defeated the dzungars  the afaqi khoja brothers burhan ud din and khan khoja reneged on the deal with the qing  declared independence and revolted against the qing  the qing and loyal uighurs like emin khoja crushed the revolt and drove burhan ud din and khan khoja to badakhshan  the qing armies reached far in central asia and came to the outskirts of tashkent while the kazakh rulers made their submissions as vassals to the qing  the afaqi brothers died in badakhshan and the ruler sultan shah delivered their bodies to the qing  ahmad shah durrani accused sultan shah of having caused the afaqi brothers to die 

durrani dispatched troops to kokand after rumours that the qing dynasty planned to launch an expedition to samarkand  but the alleged expedition never happened and ahmad shah subsequently withdrew his forces when his attempt at an anti qing alliance among central asian states failed  durrani then sent envoys to beijing to discuss the situation regarding the afaqi khojas 

during the third battle of panipat between marathas and durrani  the sikhs did not engage along with the marathas and hence are considered neutral in the war  this was because of the flawed diplomacy on the part of marathas in not recognizing their strategic potential  the exception was ala singh of patiala  who sided with the afghans and was actually being granted and coincidentally crowned the first sikh maharajah at the sikh holy temple 

durrani died on    october      in kandahar province  he was buried in the city of kandahar adjacent to the shrine of the cloak  where a large tomb was built  it has been described in the following way 
in his tomb his epitaph is written 
durrani s victory over the marathas influenced the history of the subcontinent and  in particular  british policy in the region  his refusal to continue his campaigns deeper into india prevented a clash with the east india company and allowed them to continue to acquire power and influence after they took complete control of the former mughal province of bengal in       however  fear of another afghan invasion was to haunt british policy for almost half a century after the battle of panipat  the acknowledgment of abdali s military accomplishments is reflected in a british intelligence report on the battle of panipat  which referred to ahmad shah as the  king of kings   this fear led in      to a british envoy being sent to the persian court in part to instigate the persians in their claims on herat to forestall an afghan invasion of india that might have halted british east india company s expansion  mountstuart elphinstone wrote of ahmad shah 
his successors  beginning with his son timur and ending with shuja shah durrani  proved largely incapable of governing the last afghan empire and faced with advancing enemies on all sides  much of the territory conquered by ahmad shah fell to others by the end of the   th century  they not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated some pashtun tribes and those of other durrani lineages  until dost mohammad khan s ascendancy in       chaos reigned in afghanistan  which effectively ceased to exist as a single entity  disintegrating into a fragmented collection of small countries or units  this policy ensured that he did not continue on the path of other conquerors like babur or muhammad of ghor and make india the base for his empire 

in pakistan  a short range ballistic missile abdali i  is named in the honour of ahmed shah abdali 

durrani wrote a collection of odes in his native pashto language  he was also the author of several poems in persian  the most famous pashto poem he wrote was  love of a nation  

during nader shah s invasion of india in       abdali also accompanied him and stayed some days in the red fort of delhi  when he was standing  outside the jali gate near diwan i am   asaf jah i saw him  he was  an expert in physiognomy  and predicted that abdali was  destined to become a king   when nader shah came to know about it  he  purportedly clipped  his ears with his dagger and made the remark  when you become a king  this will remind you of me   according to other sources  nader shah did not believe in it and asked him to be kind to his descendants  on the attaintment of royalty

ailanthus

ailanthus    derived from  ailanto   an ambonese word probably meaning  tree of the gods  or  tree of heaven   is a genus of trees belonging to the family simaroubaceae  in the order sapindales  formerly rutales or geraniales   the genus is native from east asia south to northern australasia 

the number of living species is disputed  with some authorities accepting up to ten species  while others accept six or fewer  species include 

there is a good fossil record of  ailanthus  with many species names based on their geographic occurrence  but almost all of these have very similar morphology and have been grouped as a single species among the three species recognized 

a silk spinning moth  the ailanthus silkmoth   samia cynthia    lives on  ailanthus  leaves  and yields a silk more durable and cheaper than mulberry silk  but inferior to it in fineness and gloss  this moth has been introduced to the eastern united states and is common near many towns  it is about     cm across  with angulated wings  and in color olive brown  with white markings  other lepidoptera whose larvae feed on  ailanthus  include  endoclita malabaricus

akkadian empire

the akkadian empire    was the first ancient empire of mesopotamia  centered in the city of akkad and its surrounding region  also called akkad in ancient mesopotamia in the bible  the empire united akkadian and sumerian speakers under one rule  the akkadian empire exercised influence across mesopotamia  the levant  and anatolia  sending military expeditions as far south as dilmun and magan  modern bahrain and oman  in the arabian peninsula 

during the  rd millennium bc  there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the sumerians and the akkadians  which included widespread bilingualism  akkadian gradually replaced sumerian as a spoken language somewhere between the  rd and the  nd millennia bc  the exact dating being a matter of debate  

the akkadian empire reached its political peak between the   th and   nd centuries bc  following the conquests by its founder sargon of akkad  under sargon and his successors  the akkadian language was briefly imposed on neighboring conquered states such as elam and gutium  akkad is sometimes regarded as the first empire in history  though the meaning of this term is not precise  and there are earlier sumerian claimants 

after the fall of the akkadian empire  the people of mesopotamia eventually coalesced into two major akkadian speaking nations  assyria in the north  and  a few centuries later  babylonia in the south 

the bible refers to akkad in   which states that the beginning of nimrod s kingdom was in the land of akkad  nimrod s historical identity is unknown  but some have compared him with the legendary gilgamesh  founder of uruk  today  scholars have documented some       texts from the akkadian period  written in both sumerian and akkadian  many later texts from the successor states of assyria and babylonia also deal with the akkadian empire 

understanding of the akkadian empire continues to be hampered by the fact that its capital akkad has not yet been located  despite numerous attempts  precise dating of archaeological sites is hindered by the fact that there are no clear distinctions between artifact assemblages thought to stem from the preceding early dynastic period  and those thought to be akkadian  likewise  material that is thought to be akkadian continues to be in use into the ur iii period 

many of the more recent insights on the akkadian empire have come from excavations in the upper khabur area in modern northeastern syria which was to become a part of assyria after the fall of akkad  for example  excavations at tell mozan  ancient urkesh  brought to light a sealing of tar am agade  a previously unknown daughter of naram sin  who was possibly married to an unidentified local  endan   ruler   the excavators at nearby tell leilan  ancient shekhna shubat enlil  have used the results from their investigations to argue that the akkadian empire came to an end due to a sudden drought  the so called     kiloyear event  the impact of this climate event on mesopotamia in general  and on the akkadian empire in particular  continues to be hotly debated 

excavation at the modern site of tell brak has suggested that the akkadians rebuilt a city   brak  or  nagar   on this site  for use as an administrative center  the city included two large buildings including a complex with temple  offices  courtyard  and large ovens 

the akkadian period is generally dated to either   according to the middle chronology timeline of the ancient near east   or  according to the short chronology timeline of the ancient near east   it was preceded by the early dynastic period of mesopotamia  ed  and succeeded by the ur iii period  although both transitions are blurry  for example  it is likely that the rise of sargon of akkad coincided with the late ed period and that the final akkadian kings ruled simultaneously with the gutian kings alongside rulers at the city states of both  uruk and lagash  the akkadian period is contemporary with  eb iv  in israel   eb iva and ej iv  in syria   and eb iiib  in turkey  

the relative order of akkadian kings is clear  the absolute dates of their reigns are approximate  as with all dates prior to the late bronze age collapse  c        bc  

the akkadian empire takes its name from the region and the city of akkad  both of which were localized in the general confluence area of the tigris and euphrates rivers  although the city of akkad has not yet been identified on the ground  it is known from various textual sources  among these is at least one text predating the reign of sargon  together with the fact that the name akkad is of non akkadian origin  this suggests that the city of akkad may have already been occupied in pre sargonic times 

sargon of akkad   sharru kin     legitimate king   possibly a title he took on gaining power  defeated and captured lugal zage si in the battle of uruk and conquered his empire  the earliest records in the akkadian language date to the time of sargon  sargon was claimed to be the son of la ibum or itti bel  a humble gardener  and possibly a hierodule  or priestess to ishtar or inanna  one legend related to sargon in assyrian times says that
later claims made on behalf of sargon were that his mother was an  entu  priestess  high priestess   the claims might have been made to ensure a descendancy of nobility  considering only a highly placed family can be made such a position 
originally a cupbearer  rabshakeh  to a king of kish with a semitic name  ur zababa  sargon thus became a gardener  responsible for the task of clearing out irrigation canals  the royal cupbearer at this time was in fact a prominent political position  close to the king and with various high level responsibilities not suggested by the title of the position itself  this gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers  who also may have served as his first soldiers  displacing ur zababa  sargon was crowned king  and he entered upon a career of foreign conquest  four times he invaded syria and canaan  and he spent three years thoroughly subduing the countries of  the west  to unite them with mesopotamia  into a single empire  

however  sargon took this process further  conquering many of the surrounding regions to create an empire that reached westward as far as the mediterranean sea and perhaps cyprus   kaptara    northward as far as the mountains  a later hittite text asserts he fought the hattian king nurdaggal of burushanda  well into anatolia   eastward over elam  and as far south as magan  oman       a region over which he reigned for purportedly    years  though only four  year names  survive  he consolidated his dominion over his territories by replacing the earlier opposing rulers with noble citizens of akkad  his native city where loyalty would thus be ensured 

trade extended from the silver mines of anatolia to the lapis lazuli mines in modern afghanistan  the cedars of lebanon and the copper of magan  this consolidation of the city states of sumer and akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of mesopotamia  the empire s breadbasket was the rain fed agricultural system of assyria and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production 

images of sargon were erected on the shores of the mediterranean  in token of his victories  and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands  elam and the northern part of mesopotamia  assyria subartu  were also subjugated  and rebellions in sumer were put down  contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against canaan and against sarlak  king of gutium  he also boasted of having subjugated the  four quarters       the lands surrounding akkad to the north  assyria   the south  sumer   the east  elam   and the west  martu   some of the earliest historiographic texts  abc         suggest he rebuilt the city of babylon   bab ilu   in its new location near akkad 

sargon  throughout his long life  showed special deference to the sumerian deities  particularly inanna  ishtar   his patroness  and zababa  the warrior god of kish  he called himself  the anointed priest of anu  and  the great  ensi  of enlil  and his daughter  enheduanna  was installed as priestess to nanna at the temple in ur 

troubles multiplied toward the end of his reign  a later babylonian text states 
it refers to his campaign in  elam   where he defeated a coalition army led by the king of awan and forced the vanquished to become his vassals 

also shortly after  another revolt took place 

sargon had crushed opposition even at old age  these difficulties broke out again in the reign of his sons  where revolts broke out during the nine year reign of rimush              bc   who fought hard to retain the empire  and was successful until he was assassinated by some of his own courtiers  rimush s elder brother  manishtushu              bc  succeeded him  the latter seems to have fought a sea battle against    kings who had gathered against him and took control over their pre arab country  consisting of modern day united arab emirates and oman  despite the success  like his brother he seems to have been assassinated in a palace conspiracy 

manishtushu s son and successor  naram sin              bc   due to vast military conquests  assumed the imperial title  king naram sin  king of the four quarters    lugal naram s  n    ar kibrat  arbaim    the four quarters as a reference to the entire world  he was also for the first time in sumerian culture  addressed as  the god  sumerian   dingir  akkadian    ilu   of agade   akkad   in opposition to the previous religious belief that kings were only representatives of the people towards the gods 
he also faced revolts at the start of his reign  but quickly crushed them 

naram sin also recorded the akkadian conquest of ebla as well as armanum and its king  armanum location is debated  it is sometimes identified with a syrian kingdom mentioned in the tablets of ebla as armi  the location of armi is also debated  while historian adelheid otto identifies it with the citadel of bazi     tall banat complex on the euphrates river between ebla and tell brak  others like wayne horowitz identify it with aleppo  further  if most scholars place armanum in syria  michael c  astour believes it to be located north of the hamrin mountains in northern iraq 

to better police syria  he built a royal residence at tell brak  a crossroads at the heart of the khabur river basin of the jezirah  naram sin campaigned against magan which also revolted  naram sin  marched against magan and personally caught mandannu  its king   where he instated garrisons to protect the main roads  the chief threat seemed to be coming from the northern zagros mountains  the lulubis and the gutians  a campaign against the lullubi led to the carving of the  victory stele of naram suen   now in the louvre  hittite sources claim naram sin of akkad even ventured into anatolia  battling the hittite and hurrian kings pamba of hatti  zipani of kanesh  and    others 
this newfound akkadian wealth may have been based upon benign climatic conditions  huge agricultural surpluses and the confiscation of the wealth of other peoples 

the economy was highly planned  grain was cleaned  and rations of grain and oil were distributed in standardized vessels made by the city s potters  taxes were paid in produce and labour on public walls  including city walls  temples  irrigation canals and waterways  producing huge agricultural surpluses 

in later assyrian and babylonian texts  the name  akkad   together with  sumer   appears as part of the royal title  as in the sumerian lugal ki en gi ki uri or akkadian    ar m  t   umeri u akkadi   translating to  king of sumer and akkad   this title was assumed by the king who seized control of nippur  the intellectual and religious center of southern mesopotamia 

during the akkadian period  the akkadian language became the lingua franca of the middle east  and was officially used for administration  although the sumerian language remained as a spoken and literary language  the spread of akkadian stretched from syria to elam  and even the elamite language was temporarily written in mesopotamian cuneiform  akkadian texts later found their way to far off places  from egypt  in the amarna period  and anatolia  to persia  behistun  

the empire of akkad fell  perhaps in the   nd century bc  within     years of its founding  ushering in a  dark age  with no prominent imperial authority until third dynasty of ur  the region s political structure may have reverted to the  status quo ante  of local governance by city states 

shu durul appears to have restored some centralized authority  however  he was unable to prevent the empire eventually collapsing outright from the invasion of barbarian peoples from the zagros mountains known as the gutians 

little is known about the gutian period  or how long it endured  cuneiform sources suggest that the gutians  administration showed little concern for maintaining agriculture  written records  or public safety  they reputedly released all farm animals to roam about mesopotamia freely and soon brought about famine and rocketing grain prices  the sumerian king ur nammu              bc  cleared the gutians from mesopotamia during his reign 

the sumerian king list  describing the akkadian empire after the death of shar kali shari  states 
however  there are no known year names or other archaeological evidence verifying any of these later kings of akkad or uruk  apart from a single artefact referencing king dudu of akkad  the named kings of uruk may have been contemporaries of the last kings of akkad  but in any event could not have been very prominent 

the period between bc and      bc is known as the ur iii period  documents again began to be written in sumerian  although sumerian was becoming a purely literary or liturgical language  much as latin later would be in medieval europe 

one explanation for the end of the akkadian empire is simply that the akkadian dynasty could not maintain its political supremacy over other independently powerful city states 

one theory associates regional decline at the end of the akkadian period  and of the first intermediary period following the old kingdom in ancient egypt  was associated with rapidly increasing aridity  and failing rainfall in the region of the ancient near east  caused by a global centennial scale drought  harvey weiss has shown that  archaeological and soil stratigraphic data define the origin  growth  and collapse of subir  the third millennium rain fed agriculture civilization of northern mesopotamia on the habur plains of syria  at      bc  a marked increase in aridity and wind circulation  subsequent to a volcanic eruption  induced a considerable degradation of land use conditions  after four centuries of urban life  this abrupt climatic change evidently caused abandonment of tell leilan  regional desertion  and collapse of the akkadian empire based in southern mesopotamia  synchronous collapse in adjacent regions suggests that the impact of the abrupt climatic change was extensive   peter b  demenocal  has shown  there was an influence of the north atlantic oscillation on the stream flow of the tigris and euphrates at this time  which led to the collapse of the akkadian empire  

excavation at tell leilan suggests that this site was abandoned soon after the city s massive walls were constructed  its temple rebuilt and its grain production reorganised  the debris  dust and sand that followed show no trace of human activity  soil samples show fine wind blown sand  no trace of earthworm activity  reduced rainfall and indications of a drier and windier climate  evidence shows that skeleton thin sheep and cattle died of drought  and up to        people abandoned the site  seeking wetter areas elsewhere  tell brak shrank in size by      trade collapsed  nomadic herders such as the amorites moved herds closer to reliable water suppliers  bringing them into conflict with akkadian populations  this climate induced collapse seems to have affected the whole of the middle east  and to have coincided with the collapse of the egyptian old kingdom 

this collapse of rain fed agriculture in the upper country meant the loss to southern mesopotamia of the agrarian subsidies which had kept the akkadian empire solvent  water levels within the tigris and euphrates fell     metres beneath the level of      bc  and although they stabilised for a time during the following ur iii period  rivalries between pastoralists and farmers increased  attempts were undertaken to prevent the former from herding their flocks in agricultural lands  such as the building of a wall known as the  repeller of the amorites  between the tigris and euphrates under the ur iii ruler shu sin  such attempts led to increased political instability  meanwhile  severe depression occurred to re establish demographic equilibrium with the less favourable climatic conditions 

richard zettler has critiqued the drought theory  observing that the chronology of the akkadian empire is very uncertain and that available evidence is not sufficient to show its economic dependence on the northern areas excavated by weiss and others  he also criticizes weiss for taking akkadian writings literally to describe certain catastrophic events 

according to joan oates  at tell brak the soil  signal  associated with the drought lies below the level of naram sin s palace  however  evidence

may suggest a tightening of akkadian control following the brak  event   for example the construction of the heavily fortified  palace  itself and the apparent introduction of greater numbers of akkadian as opposed to local officials  perhaps a reflection of unrest in the countryside of the type that often follows some natural catastrophe  furthermore  brak remained occupied and functional after the fall of the akkadians 

the akkadian government formed a  classical standard  with which all future mesopotamian states compared themselves  traditionally  the  ensi  was the highest functionary of the sumerian city states  in later traditions  one became an  ensi  by marrying the goddess inanna  legitimising the rulership through divine consent 

initially  the monarchical  lugal    lu    man   gal   great  was subordinate to the priestly  ensi   and was appointed at times of troubles  but by later dynastic times  it was the  lugal  who had emerged as the preeminent role  having his own           house  or  palace   independent from the temple establishment  by the time of mesalim  whichever dynasty controlled the city of kish was recognised as    ar ki    ati     king of kish   and was considered preeminent in sumer  possibly because this was where the two rivers approached  and whoever controlled kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream 

as sargon extended his conquest from the  lower sea   persian gulf   to the  upper sea   mediterranean   it was felt that he ruled  the totality of the lands under heaven   or  from sunrise to sunset   as contemporary texts put it  under sargon  the  ensi s generally retained their positions  but were seen more as provincial governors  the title    ar ki    ati  became recognised as meaning  lord of the universe   sargon is even recorded as having organised naval expeditions to dilmun  bahrain  and magan  amongst the first organised military naval expeditions in history  whether he also did in the case of the mediterranean with the kingdom of kaptara  possibly cyprus   as claimed in later documents  is more questionable 

with naram sin  sargon s grandson  this went further than with sargon  with the king not only being called  lord of the four quarters  of the earth    but also elevated to the ranks of the  dingir     gods   with his own temple establishment  previously a ruler could  like gilgamesh  become divine after death but the akkadian kings  from naram sin onward  were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes  their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainers 

one strategy adopted by both sargon and naram sin  to maintain control of the country  was to install their daughters  enheduanna and emmenanna respectively  as high priestess to sin  the akkadian version of the sumerian moon deity  nanna  at ur  in the extreme south of sumer  to install sons as provincial  ensi  governors in strategic locations  and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the empire  urkesh and marhashe   a well documented case of the latter is that of naram sin s daughter tar am agade at urkesh 

records at the brak administrative complex suggest that the akkadians appointed locals as tax collectors 

the population of akkad  like nearly all pre modern states  was entirely dependent upon the agricultural systems of the region  which seem to have had two principal centres  the irrigated farmlands of southern iraq that traditionally had a yield of    grains returned for each grain sown and the rain fed agriculture of northern iraq  known as the  upper country  

southern iraq during akkadian period seems to have been approaching its modern rainfall level of less than per year  with the result that agriculture was totally dependent upon irrigation  before the akkadian period the progressive salinisation of the soils  produced by poorly drained irrigation  had been reducing yields of wheat in the southern part of the country  leading to the conversion to more salt tolerant barley growing  urban populations there had peaked already by       bc  and demographic pressures were high  contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately before the akkadian period  as seen in the stele of the vultures of eannatum   warfare between city states had led to a population decline  from which akkad provided a temporary respite  it was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time  giving akkad its military advantage 

the water table in this region was very high and replenished regularly   by winter storms in the headwaters of the tigris and euphrates from october to march and from snow melt from march to july  flood levels  that had been stable from about       to       bc  had started falling  and by the akkadian period were a half meter to a meter lower than recorded previously  even so  the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the nile  serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence  requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems  farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from august to october   a period of food shortage   under the control of city temple authorities  thus acting as a form of unemployment relief  gwendolyn leick has suggested that this was sargon s original employment for the king of kish  giving him experience in effectively organising large groups of men  a tablet reads   sargon  the king  to whom enlil permitted no rival         warriors ate bread daily before him  
harvest was in the late spring and during the dry summer months  nomadic amorites from the northwest would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals  for this privilege  they would have to pay a tax in wool  meat  milk  and cheese to the temples  who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood  in good years  all would go well  but in bad years  wild winter pastures would be in short supply  nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields  and conflicts with farmers would result  it would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the empire temporarily overcame this problem  and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region 

as a result  sumer and akkad had a surplus of agricultural products but was short of almost everything else  particularly metal ores  timber and building stone  all of which had to be imported  the spread of the akkadian state as far as the  silver mountain   possibly the taurus mountains   the  cedars  of lebanon  and the copper deposits of magan  was largely motivated by the goal of securing control over these imports  one tablet reads  sargon  the king of kish  triumphed in thirty four battles  over the cities  up to the edge of the sea  and  destroyed their walls  he made the ships from meluhha  the ships from magan  and  the ships from dilmun tie up alongside the quay of agade  sargon the king prostrated himself before  the god  dagan  and  made supplication to him   and  he  dagan  gave him the upper land  namely mari  yarmuti   and  ebla  up to the cedar forest  and  up to the silver mountain  

in art  there was a great emphasis on the kings of the dynasty  alongside much that continued earlier sumerian art  little architecture remains  in large works and small ones such as seals  the degree of realism was considerably increased  but the seals show a  grim world of cruel conflict  of danger and uncertainty  a world in which man is subjected without appeal to the incomprehensible acts of distant and fearful divinities who he must serve but cannot love  this sombre mood     remained characteristic of mesopotamian art    

during the  rd millennium bc  there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the sumerians and the akkadians  which included widespread bilingualism  the influence of sumerian on akkadian  and vice versa  is evident in all areas  from lexical borrowing on a massive scale  to syntactic  morphological  and phonological convergence  this has prompted scholars to refer to sumerian and akkadian in the third millennium as a  sprachbund   akkadian gradually replaced sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around      bc  the exact dating being a matter of debate   but sumerian continued to be used as a sacred  ceremonial  literary  and scientific language in mesopotamia until the  st century ad 

sumerian literature continued in rich development during the akkadian period  enheduanna  the  wife  sumerian  dam    high priestess  of nanna  the sumerian moon god  and daughter of sargon  of the temple of sin at ur  who lived         bc  is the first poet in history whose name is known  her known works include hymns to the goddess inanna  the  exaltation of inanna  and  in nin sa gur ra   a third work  the  temple hymns   a collection of specific hymns  addresses the sacred temples and their occupants  the deity to whom they were consecrated  the works of this poet are significant  because although they start out using the third person  they shift to the first person voice of the poet herself  and they mark a significant development in the use of cuneiform  as poet  princess  and priestess  she was a person who  according to william w hallo   set standards in all three of her roles for many succeeding centuries 

in the  exultation of inanna  
later material described how the fall of akkad was due to nara sin s attack upon the city of nipper  when prompted by a pair of inauspicious oracles  the king sacked the e kur temple  supposedly protected by the god enlil  head of the pantheon  as a result of this  eight chief deities of the anunnaki pantheon were supposed to have come together and withdrawn their support from akkad 
the kings of akkad were legendary among later mesopotamian civilizations  with sargon understood as the prototype of a strong and wise leader  and his grandson naram sin considered the wicked and impious leader   unheilsherrscher  in the analysis of hans gustav g  terbock  who brought ruin upon his kingdom 

 tablets from the periods reads     from the earliest days  no one had made a statue of lead   but  rimush king of kish  had a statue of himself made of lead  it stood before enlil  and it recited his  rimush s  virtues to the idu of the gods    the copper bassetki statue  cast with the lost wax method  testifies to the high level of skill that craftsmen achieved during the akkadian period 

the empire was bound together by roads  along which there was a regular postal service  clay seals that took the place of stamps bear the names of sargon and his son  a cadastral survey seems also to have been instituted  and one of the documents relating to it states that a certain uru malik  whose name appears to indicate his canaanite origin  was governor of the land of the amorites  or  amurru  as the semi nomadic people of syria and canaan were called in akkadian  it is probable that the first collection of astronomical observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by sargon  the earliest  year names   whereby each year of a king s reign was named after a significant event performed by that king  date from sargon s reign  lists of these  year names  henceforth became a calendrical system used in most independent mesopotamian city states  in assyria  however  years came to be named for the annual presiding  limmu  official appointed by the king  rather than for an event 







ajax the lesser

ajax    aias   was a greek mythological hero  son of oileus  the king of locris  he was called the  lesser  or  locrian  ajax  to distinguish him from ajax the great  son of telamon  he was the leader of the locrian contingent during the trojan war  he is a significant figure in homer s  iliad  and is also mentioned in the  odyssey   in virgil s  aeneid  and in euripides   the trojan women   in etruscan legend  he was known as  aivas vilates  

ajax s mother s name was eriopis  according to strabo  he was born in naryx in locris  where ovid calls him  narycius heroes   according to the  iliad   he led his locrians in forty ships against troy  he is described as one of the great heroes among the greeks  in battle  he wore a linen cuirass     was brave and intrepid  especially skilled in throwing the spear and  next to achilles  the swiftest of all the greeks 

in the funeral games at the pyre of patroclus  ajax contended with odysseus and antilochus for the prize in the footrace  but athena  who was hostile towards him and favored odysseus  made him stumble and fall  so that he won only the second prize  

in later traditions  this ajax is called a son of oileus and the nymph rhene and is also mentioned among the suitors of helen  after the taking of troy  he rushed into the temple of athena  where cassandra had taken refuge  and was embracing the statue of the goddess in supplication  ajax violently dragged her away to the other captives  according to some writers  he raped cassandra inside the temple  odysseus called for ajax s death by stoning for this crime  but ajax saved himself by claiming innocence with an oath to athena  clutching her statue in supplication 

since ajax dragged a supplicant from her temple  athena had cause to be indignant  according to the  bibliotheca   no one was aware that ajax had raped cassandra until calchas  the greek seer  warned the greeks that athena was furious at the treatment of her priestess and she would destroy the greek ships if they didn t kill him immediately  despite this  ajax managed to hide in the altar of a deity where the greeks  fearing divine retribution should they kill him and destroy the altar  allowed him to live  when the greeks left without killing ajax  despite their sacrifices  athena became so angry that she persuaded zeus to send a storm that sank many of their ships 

as he was returning from troy  athena hit his ship with a thunderbolt and the vessel was wrecked on the whirling rocks     but he escaped with some of his men  managing to cling onto a rock through the assistance of poseidon  he would have been saved in spite of athena  but he then audaciously declared that he would escape the dangers of the sea in defiance of the immortals  offended by this presumption  poseidon split the rock with his trident and ajax was swallowed up by the sea  thetis buried him when the corpse washed up on myconos  other versions depict a different death for ajax  showing him dying when on his voyage home  in these versions  when ajax came to the capharean rocks on the coast of euboea  his ship was wrecked in a fierce storm  he himself was lifted up in a whirlwind and impaled with a flash of rapid fire from athena in his chest  and his body thrust upon sharp rocks  which afterwards were called the rocks of ajax 

after ajax s death  his spirit dwelt in the island of leuce  the opuntian locrians worshiped ajax as their national hero  and so great was their faith in him that when they drew up their army in battle  they always left one place open for him  believing that  although invisible to them  he was fighting for and among them  the story of ajax was frequently made use of by ancient poets and artists  and the hero who appears on some locrian coins with the helmet  shield  and sword is probably this ajax 

other accounts of ajax s death are offered by philostratus and the scholiast on lycophron 

the abduction of cassandra by ajax was frequently represented in greek works of art  such as the chest of cypselus described by pausanias and in extant works 





ajax the great

ajax or aias   or   greek   gen   aiantos   archaic   is a mythological greek hero  the son of king telamon and periboea  and the half brother of teucer  he plays an important role  and is portrayed as a towering figure and a warrior of great courage in homer s  iliad  and in the epic cycle  a series of epic poems about the trojan war  he is also referred to as  telamonian ajax     in etruscan recorded as  aivas tlamunus     greater ajax   or  ajax the great   which distinguishes him from ajax  son of oileus  ajax the lesser   

ajax is the son of telamon  who was the son of aeacus and grandson of zeus  and his first wife periboea  he is the cousin of achilles  and is the elder half brother of teucer  
his given name is derived from the root of  to lament   translating to  one who laments  mourner  
many illustrious athenians  including cimon  miltiades  alcibiades and the historian thucydides  traced their descent from ajax  on an etruscan tomb dedicated to racvi satlnei in bologna   th century bc  there is an inscription that says   aivastelmunsl  which means   family  of telamonian ajax  

in homer s  iliad  he is described as of great stature  colossal frame and strongest of all the achaeans  known as the  bulwark of the achaeans   he was trained by the centaur chiron  who had trained ajax s father telamon and achilles s father peleus and would later die of an accidental wound inflicted by heracles  whom he was at the time training   at the same time as achilles  he was described as fearless  strong and powerful but also with a very high level of combat intelligence  ajax commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cow hides with a layer of bronze  most notably  ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the  iliad   and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods  except for agamemnon  who take part in the battles  although  in book     poseidon strikes ajax with his staff  renewing his strength  unlike diomedes  agamemnon  and achilles  ajax appears as a mainly defensive warrior  instrumental in the defence of the greek camp and ships and that of patroclus  body  when the trojans are on the offensive  he is often seen covering the retreat of the achaeans  significantly  while one of the deadliest heroes in the whole poem  ajax has no aristeia depicting him on the offensive 

in the  iliad   ajax is notable for his abundant strength and courage  seen particularly in two fights with hector  in book    ajax is chosen by lot to meet hector in a duel which lasts most of a whole day  ajax at first gets the better of the encounter  wounding hector with his spear and knocking him down with a large stone  but hector fights on until the heralds  acting at the direction of zeus  call a draw  with the two combatants exchanging gifts  ajax giving hector a purple sash and hector giving ajax his sharp sword 

the second fight between ajax and hector occurs when the latter breaks into the mycenaean camp  and fights with the greeks among the ships  in book     ajax throws a giant rock at hector which almost kills him  in book     hector is restored to his strength by apollo and returns to attack the ships  ajax  wielding an enormous spear as a weapon and leaping from ship to ship  holds off the trojan armies virtually single handedly  in book     hector and ajax duel once again  hector then disarms ajax  although ajax is not hurt  and ajax is forced to retreat  seeing that zeus is clearly favoring hector  hector and the trojans succeed in burning one greek ship  the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war  ajax is responsible for the death of many trojan lords  including phorcys 

ajax often fought in tandem with his brother teucer  known for his skill with the bow  ajax would wield his magnificent shield  as teucer stood behind picking off enemy trojans 

achilles was absent during these encounters because of his feud with agamemnon  in book    agamemnon and the other mycenaean chiefs send ajax  odysseus and phoenix to the tent of achilles in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight  although ajax speaks earnestly and is well received  he does not succeed in convincing achilles 

when patroclus is killed  hector tries to steal his body  ajax  assisted by menelaus  succeeds in fighting off the trojans and taking the body back with his chariot  however  the trojans have already stripped patroclus of achilles  armor  ajax s prayer to zeus to remove the fog that has descended on the battle to allow them to fight or die in the light of day has become proverbial  according to hyginus  in total  ajax killed    people at troy 

as the  iliad  comes to a close  ajax and the majority of other greek warriors are alive and well  when achilles dies  killed by paris  with help from apollo   ajax and odysseus are the heroes who fight against the trojans to get the body and bury it with his companion  patroclus  ajax  with his great shield and spear  manages to recover the body and carry it to the ships  while odysseus fights off the trojans  after the burial  each claims achilles  magical armor  which had been forged on mount olympus by the smith god hephaestus  for himself as recognition for his heroic efforts  a competition is held to determine who deserves the armor  ajax argues that because of his strength and the fighting he has done for the greeks  including saving the ships from hector  and driving him off with a massive rock  he deserves the armor  however  odysseus proves to be more eloquent  and with the aid of athena  the council gives him the armor  ajax   unconquered   and furious  becomes crazed and slaughters the achaians  herds of captured livestock  believing them to be his enemies through a trick of athena  unable to deal with this dual dishonor  he falls upon his own sword   conquered by his  own  sorrow   and commits suicide  
the belvedere torso  a marble torso now in the vatican museums  is considered to depict ajax  in the act of contemplating his suicide  

in sophocles  play  ajax   a famous retelling of ajax s demise  after the armor is awarded to odysseus  ajax feels so insulted that he wants to kill agamemnon and menelaus  athena intervenes and clouds his mind and vision  and he goes to a flock of sheep and slaughters them  imagining they are the achaean leaders  including odysseus and agamemnon  when he comes to his senses  covered in blood  he realizes that what he has done has diminished his honor  and decides that he prefers to kill himself rather than live in shame  he does so with the same sword which hector gave him when they exchanged presents  from his blood sprang a red flower  as at the death of hyacinthus  which bore on its leaves the initial letters of his name  ai   also expressive of lament  his ashes were deposited in a golden urn on the rhoetean promontory at the entrance of the hellespont 

ajax s half brother teucer stood trial before his father for not bringing ajax s body or famous weapons back  teucer was acquitted for responsibility but found guilty of negligence  he was disowned by his father and was not allowed to return to his home  the island of salamis off the coast of athens 

homer is somewhat vague about the precise manner of ajax s death but does ascribe it to his loss in the dispute over achilles  armor  when odysseus visits hades  he begs the soul of ajax to speak to him  but ajax  still resentful over the old quarrel  refuses and descends silently back into erebus 

like achilles  he is represented  although not by homer  as living after his death on the island of leuke at the mouth of the danube  ajax  who in the post homeric legend is described as the grandson of aeacus and the great grandson of zeus  was the tutelary hero of the island of salamis  where he had a temple and an image  and where a festival called  aianteia  was celebrated in his honour  at this festival a couch was set up  on which the panoply of the hero was placed  a practice which recalls the roman lectisternium  the identification of ajax with the family of aeacus was chiefly a matter which concerned the athenians  after salamis had come into their possession  on which occasion solon is said to have inserted a line in the  iliad                 for the purpose of supporting the athenian claim to the island  ajax then became an attic hero  he was worshiped at athens  where he had a statue in the market place  and the tribe  aiantis  was named after him  pausanias also relates that a gigantic skeleton  its kneecap in diameter  appeared on the beach near sigeion  on the trojan coast  these bones were identified as those of ajax 

there is a legend that ajax founded the city of ajaccio in the mediterranean island of corsica  now part of france  and gave it his name 

in       yannos lolos began excavating a mycenaean palace on the island of salamis which he supposed to be the home of the mythological aiacid dynasty  the ruins have been excavated at a site near the village of kanakia of salamis  a few miles off the coast of athens  the multi story structure covers and had perhaps    rooms  the trojan war perhaps occurred at the height of the mycenaean civilization  see discussion of troy vii   roughly the point at which this palace appears to have been abandoned

alaric i

alaric i       ruler of all          or         ad  was the first king of the visigoths from            son  or paternal grandson  of chieftain rothestes  he is best known for his sack of rome in      which marked a decisive event in the decline of the roman empire 

alaric began his career under the gothic soldier gainas  and later joined the roman army  he first appeared as leader of a mixed band of goths and allied peoples  who invaded thrace in     but were stopped by the half vandal roman general stilicho  in      he led a gothic force of        that helped roman emperor theodosius defeat the frankish usurper arbogast at the battle of frigidus  despite sacrificing around        of his men  alaric received little recognition from the emperor  disappointed  he left the army  was elected reiks of the visigoths in     and marched toward constantinople until he was diverted by roman forces  he then moved southward into greece  where he sacked piraeus  the port of athens  and destroyed corinth  megara  argos and sparta  nonetheless  the eastern emperor arcadius appointed alaric magister militum   master of the soldiers   in illyricum 

in     alaric invaded italy  but was defeated by stilicho at pollentia  modern pollenza  on april        a second invasion that same year also ended in defeat at the battle of verona  although he did force the roman senate to pay a large subsidy to the visigoths  during radagaisus  italian invasion in      he remained idle in illyria  in      western emperor honorius ordered the execution of stilicho and his family  in response to rumors that the general had made a deal with alaric  honorius then incited the roman population to massacre tens of thousands of wives and children of foederati goths serving in the roman military  the gothic soldiers then defected to alaric  increasing the size of his force to around        men  and joined his march on rome to avenge their murdered families 

moving swiftly along roman roads  alaric sacked the cities of aquileia and cremona and ravaged the lands along the adriatic sea  the visigothic leader thereupon laid siege to rome in      but eventually the senate granted him a substantial subsidy  in addition  he forced the senate to liberate all        gothic slaves in rome  honorius  however  refused to appoint alaric as the commander of the western roman army  and in     the visigoths again surrounded rome  alaric lifted his blockade after proclaiming attalus western emperor  attalus appointed him magister utriusque militiae   master of both services    but refused to allow him to send an army into africa  negotiations with honorius broke down  after which alaric deposed attalus in the summer of     and besieged rome for the third time  allies within the capital opened the gates for him on august    and for three days his troops sacked the city  although the visigoths plundered rome  they treated its inhabitants humanely and burned only a few buildings  having abandoned a plan to occupy sicily and north africa after the destruction of his fleet in a storm  alaric died as the visigoths were marching northward 

born on peuce island at the mouth of the danube delta in present day romania  alaric belonged to the noble balti dynasty of the tervingian goths  the goths suffered setbacks against the huns  made a mass migration across the danube  and fought a war with rome  alaric was probably a child during this period 

during the fourth century  the roman emperors commonly employed  foederati   irregular troops under roman command  but organized by tribal structures  to spare the provincial populations from excessive taxation and to save money  emperors began to employ units recruited from germanic tribes  the largest of these contingents was that of the goths  who in          in some sources   had been allowed to settle within the imperial boundaries  keeping a large degree of autonomy 

in     alaric served as a leader of  foederati  under theodosius i in the campaign which crushed the usurper eugenius  as the battle of the frigidus  which terminated this campaign  was fought at the passes of the julian alps  alaric probably learned the weakness of italy s natural defences on its northeastern frontier at the head of the adriatic sea 

theodosius died in      leaving the empire to be divided between his two sons arcadius and honorius  the former taking the eastern and the latter the western portion of the empire  arcadius showed little interest in ruling  leaving most of the actual power to his praetorian prefect rufinus  honorius was still a minor  as his guardian  theodosius had appointed the  magister militum  stilicho  stilicho also claimed to be the guardian of arcadius  causing much rivalry between the western and eastern courts 

according to edward gibbon in  the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire   during the shifting of offices that took place at the beginning of the new reigns  alaric apparently hoped he would be promoted from a mere commander to the rank of general in one of the regular armies  he was denied the promotion  however  among the visigoths settled in lower moesia  now part of bulgaria and romania   the situation was ripe for rebellion  they had suffered disproportionately great losses at frigidus  according to rumour  exposing the visigoths in battle was a convenient way of weakening the gothic tribes  this  combined with their post battle rewards  prompted them to raise alaric  on a shield  and proclaim him king  according to jordanes  a  th century roman bureaucrat of gothic origin who later turned his hand to history  both the new king and his people decided  rather to seek new kingdoms by their own work  than to slumber in peaceful subjection to the rule of others  

alaric struck first at the eastern empire  he marched to the neighborhood of constantinople but  finding himself unable to undertake a siege  retraced his steps westward and then marched southward through thessaly and the unguarded pass of thermopylae into greece 

the armies of the eastern empire were occupied with hunnic incursions in asia minor and syria  instead  rufinus attempted to negotiate with alaric in person  which only aroused suspicions in constantinople that rufinus was in league with the goths  stilicho now marched east against alaric  according to claudian  stilicho was in a position to destroy the goths when he was ordered by arcadius   influenced by rufinus   to leave illyricum  soon after  rufinus  own soldiers hacked him to death  power in constantinople now passed to the eunuch chamberlain eutropius 

rufinus  death and stilicho s departure gave free rein to alaric s movements  he ravaged attica but spared athens  which capitulated at once to the conqueror  in      he wiped out the last remnants of the mysteries at eleusis in attica  ending a tradition of esoteric religious ceremonies that had lasted since the bronze age  then he penetrated into the peloponnesus and captured its most famous cities   corinth  argos  and sparta   selling many of their inhabitants into slavery 

here  however  his victorious career suffered a serious setback  in     stilicho crossed the sea to greece and succeeded in trapping the goths in the mountains of pholoe  on the borders of elis and arcadia in the peninsula  from there alaric escaped with difficulty  and not without some suspicion of connivance by stilicho  who supposedly had again received orders to depart  alaric then crossed the gulf of corinth and marched with the plunder of greece northward to epirus  here his rampage continued until the eastern government appointed him  magister militum per illyricum   giving him the roman command he had desired  as well as the authority to resupply his men from the imperial arsenals 

it was probably in     that alaric made his first invasion of italy  originally with the intention to petition for a position closer to rome  alaric had a fascination for the  golden age  of rome and insisted on his tribesmen calling him  alaricus   supernatural influences were not lacking to urge him to this great enterprise  some lines of the roman poet claudian inform us that he heard a voice proceeding from a sacred grove   break off all delays  alaric  this very year thou shalt force the alpine barrier of italy  thou shalt penetrate to the city   but the prophecy was not to be fulfilled at this time  after spreading desolation through northern italy and striking terror into the citizens of rome  alaric was met by stilicho at pollentia  today in piedmont  the battle which followed on april         coinciding with easter   was a costly victory for rome  but it effectively halted the goths  progress 

stilicho s enemies later reproached him for having gained his victory by taking impious advantage of the great christian festival  alaric  too  was outwardly a christian  though an arian rather than orthodox  though he continued to practice the pagan rituals of his ancestors as well as observing christian ritual practices  he had trusted to the sanctity of easter for immunity from attack 

alaric s wife was reportedly taken prisoner after this battle  it is not unreasonable to suppose that he and his troops were hampered by the presence of large numbers of women and children  which gave his invasion of italy the character of a human migration 

after another defeat before verona  alaric left italy  probably in      he had not  penetrated to the city  but his invasion of italy had produced important results  it caused the imperial residence to be transferred from milan to ravenna  and necessitated the withdrawal of legio xx  valeria victrix  from britain 

alaric became the friend and ally of his erstwhile opponent  stilicho  by      the estrangement between the eastern and western courts had become so bitter that it threatened civil war  stilicho actually proposed using alaric s troops to enforce honorius  claim to the prefecture of illyricum  the death of arcadius in may     caused milder counsel to prevail in the western court  but alaric  who had actually entered epirus  demanded in a somewhat threatening manner that if he were thus suddenly requested to desist from war  he should be paid handsomely for what modern language would call the  expenses of mobilization   the sum which he named was a large one         pounds of gold  under strong pressure from stilicho  the roman senate consented to promise its payment 

but three months later  stilicho and the chief ministers of his party were treacherously slain on honorius  orders  in the unrest that followed throughout italy  the wives and children of the foederati were slain  consequently  these        men flocked to alaric s camp  clamouring to be led against their cowardly enemies  he accordingly led them across the julian alps and  in september      stood before the walls of rome  now with no capable general like stilicho as a defender  and began a strict blockade 

no blood was shed this time  alaric relied on hunger as his most powerful weapon  when the ambassadors of the senate  entreating for peace  tried to intimidate him with hints of what the despairing citizens might accomplish  he laughed and gave his celebrated answer   the thicker the hay  the easier mowed   after much bargaining  the famine stricken citizens agreed to pay a ransom of       pounds of gold         pounds of silver        silken tunics        hides dyed scarlet  and       pounds of pepper  along came        freed gothic slaves  thus ended alaric s first siege of rome  the combined value of the gold and silver in pure coinage would have been worth      pounds in gold or       million solidi   enough to provide the basic needs of         adults and children for a year or equip        roman infantry and cavalry 

throughout his career  alaric s primary goal was not to undermine the empire  but to secure for himself a regular and recognized position within the empire s borders  his demands were certainly grand  the concession of a block of territory      miles long by     wide between the danube and the gulf of venice  to be held probably on some terms of nominal dependence on the empire  and the title of commander in chief of the imperial army  as outrageous as his terms were  the emperor would have been well advised to grant them  honorius  however  refused to see beyond his own safety  guaranteed by the dikes and marshes of ravenna  as all attempts to conduct a satisfactory negotiation with this emperor failed  alaric  after instituting a second siege and blockade of rome in      came to terms with the senate  with their consent  he set up a rival emperor  the prefect of the city  a greek named priscus attalus 

alaric cashiered his ineffectual puppet emperor after eleven months and again tried to reopen negotiations with honorius  these negotiations might have succeeded had it not been for the influence of another goth  sarus  an amali  and therefore hereditary enemy of alaric and his house  alaric  again outwitted by an enemy s machinations  marched southward  and began his third siege of rome  apparently  defence was impossible  there are hints  not well substantiated  of treachery  surprise is a more likely explanation  however  this may be   for our information at this point of the story is meagre   on august          alaric and his visigoths burst in by the porta salaria on the northeast of the city  rome  for so long victorious against its enemies  was now at the mercy of its foreign conquerors 

the contemporary ecclesiastics recorded with wonder many instances of the visigoths  clemency  christian churches saved from ravage  protection granted to vast multitudes both of pagans and christians who took refuge therein  vessels of gold and silver which were found in a private dwelling  spared because they  belonged to st  peter   at least one case in which a beautiful roman matron appealed  not in vain  to the better feelings of the gothic soldier who attempted her dishonor  but even these exceptional instances show that rome was not entirely spared the horrors which usually accompany the storming of a besieged city  nonetheless  the written sources do not mention damages wrought by fire  save the gardens of sallust  which were situated close to the gate by which the goths had made their entrance  nor is there any reason to attribute any extensive destruction of the buildings of the city to alaric and his followers  the basilica aemilia in the roman forum did burn down  which perhaps can be attributed to alaric  the archaeological evidence was provided by coins dating from     found melted in the floor  the pagan emperors  tombs of the mausoleum of augustus and castel sant angelo were rifled and the ashes scattered 

alaric  having penetrated the city  marched southwards into calabria  he desired to invade africa  which  thanks to its grain  had become the key to holding italy  but a storm battered his ships into pieces and many of his soldiers drowned  alaric died soon after in cosenza  probably of fever  and his body was  according to legend  buried under the riverbed of the busento in accordance with the pagan practices of the visigothic people 

scholars have often wondered about the cause of king alaric s death  recently  francesco galassi and his colleagues pored over all the historical  medical and epidemiological sources they could find about the king s death  and concluded that the underlying cause was malaria 

the stream was temporarily turned aside from its course while the grave was dug  wherein the gothic chief and some of his most precious spoils were interred  when the work was finished  the river was turned back into its usual channel and the captives by whose hands the labor had been accomplished were put to death that none might learn their secret 
a similar story is told of the decebalus treasure  buried under a river in     ad 
these burials repeat scythian models from the lower danube and the black sea 

alaric was succeeded in the command of the gothic army by his brother in law  ataulf  who married honorius  sister galla placidia three years later 

the chief authorities on the career of alaric are  the historian orosius and the poet claudian  both contemporary  neither disinterested  zosimus  a historian who lived probably about half a century after alaric s death  and jordanes  a goth who wrote the history of his nation in      basing his work on cassiodorus s  gothic history   the legend of alaric s burial in the buzita river comes from jordanes 







alaric ii

alaric ii     ruler of all   august       also known as alarik  alarich  and alarico in spanish and portuguese or alaricus in latin     succeeded his father euric as king of the visigoths in toulouse on december          he was the great grandson of the more famous alaric i  who sacked rome in      he established his capital at aire sur l adour   vicus julii   in aquitaine  his dominions included not only the majority of hispania  excluding its northwestern corner  but also gallia aquitania and the greater part of an as yet undivided gallia narbonensis 

herwig wolfram opens his chapter on the eighth visigothic king   alaric s reign gets no full treatment in the sources  and the little they do contain is overshadowed by his death in the battle of vouill   and the downfall of the toulosan kingdom   one example is isidore of seville s account of alaric s reign  consisting of a single paragraph  it is primarily about alaric s death in that battle 

the earliest documented event in alaric s reign concerned providing refuge to syagrius  the former ruler of the domain of soissons  in what is now northwestern france  who had been defeated by clovis i  king of the franks  according to gregory of tours  account  alaric was intimidated by clovis into surrendering syagrius to clovis  gregory then adds that  the goths are a timorous race   the franks then imprisoned syagrius  and once his control over syagrius  former kingdom was secure  clovis had him beheaded  however  wolfram points out that at the time  clovis got no farther than the seine  only after several more years did the franks succeed in occupying the rest of the gallo roman buffer state north of the loire   any threat of war clovis could make would only be effective if they were neighbors   it is nowhere written that syagrius was handed over in     or      

despite frankish advances in the years that followed  alaric was not afraid to take the military initiative when it presented itself  in      alaric assisted his fellow gothic king  theodoric the great  in his conquest of italy by dispatching an army to raise odoacer s siege of pavia  where theodoric had been trapped  then when the franks attacked the burgundians in the decade after      alaric assisted the ruling house  and according to wolfram the victorious burgundian king gundobad ceded avignon to alaric  by     clovis and alaric met on an island in the loire near amboise for face to face talks  which led to a peace treaty 

in      the visigoths captured the city of dertosa in the ebro valley  there they captured the roman usurper peter and had him executed 

after a few years  however  clovis violated the peace treaty negotiated in      despite the diplomatic intervention of theodoric  king of the ostrogoths and father in law of alaric  clovis led his followers into visigothic territory  alaric was forced by his magnates to meet clovis in the battle of vouill    summer      near poitiers  there the goths were defeated and alaric slain  according to gregory of tours  by clovis himself 

the most serious consequence of this battle was not the loss of their possessions in gaul to the franks  with ostrogothic help  much of the gallic territory was recovered  herwig wolfram notes  perhaps as far as toulouse  nor was it the loss of the royal treasury at toulouse  which gregory of tours writes clovis took into his possession  as peter heather notes  the visigothic kingdom was thrown into disarray  by the death of its king in battle   alaric s heirs were his eldest son  the illegitimate gesalec  and his younger son  the legitimate amalaric who was still a child  gesalec proved incompetent  and in     king theodoric assumed the throne of the kingdom ostensibly on behalf of amalaric   heather uses the word  hijacked  to describe his action  although amalaric eventually became king in his own right  the political continuity of the visigothic kingdom was broken   amalaric s succession was the result of new power structures  not old ones   as heather describes it  with amalaric s death in      the visigothic kingdom entered an extended period of unrest which lasted until leovigild assumed the throne in     

in religion alaric was an arian  like all the early visigothic nobles  but he greatly mitigated the persecution policy of his father euric toward the catholics and authorized them to hold in     the council of agde  he was on uneasy terms with the catholic bishops of arelate  modern arles  as epitomized in the career of the frankish caesarius  bishop of arles  who was appointed bishop in      caesarius was suspected of conspiring with the burgundians  whose king had married the sister of clovis  to assist the burgundians capture arles  alaric exiled him for a year to bordeaux in aquitania  then allowed him to return unharmed when the crisis had passed 

alaric displayed similar wisdom in political affairs by appointing a commission headed by the referendary anianus to prepare an abstract of the roman laws and imperial decrees  which would form the authoritative code for his roman subjects  this is generally known as the  breviarium alaricianum  or breviary of alaric 

the  alaric s mountain  near carcassonne is named after the visigoth king  local rumour has it that he left a vast treasure buried in the caves beneath the mountain 

the  alaric s canal  in the hautes pyr  n  es department is named after him 





albertus magnus

albertus magnus  o p   c           november            also known as saint albert the great and albert of cologne  was a german catholic dominican friar and bishop  later canonised as a catholic saint  he was known during his lifetime as  doctor universalis  and  doctor expertus  and  late in his life  the sobriquet  magnus  was appended to his name  scholars such as james a  weisheipl and joachim r  s  der have referred to him as the greatest german philosopher and theologian of the middle ages  the catholic church distinguishes him as one of the    doctors of the church 

it seems likely that albert was born sometime before       given well attested evidence that he was aged over    on his death in       more than one source says that albert was    on his death  which has led      to be commonly given as the date of albert s birth  albert was probably born in lauingen  now in bavaria   since he called himself  albert of lauingen   but this might simply be a family name  most probably his family was of  ministerial  class  his familiar connection with  being son of the count  bollst  dt noble family was a   th century misinterpretation that is now completely disproved 

albert was probably educated principally at the university of padua  where he received instruction in aristotle s writings  a late account by rudolph de novamagia refers to albertus  encounter with the blessed virgin mary  who convinced him to enter holy orders  in       or       he became a member of the dominican order  and studied theology at bologna and elsewhere  selected to fill the position of lecturer at cologne  germany  where the dominicans had a house  he taught for several years there  as well as in regensburg  freiburg  strasbourg  and hildesheim  during his first tenure as lecturer at cologne  albert wrote his  summa de bono  after discussion with philip the chancellor concerning the transcendental properties of being  in       albert became master of theology under gueric of saint quentin  the first german dominican to achieve this distinction  following this turn of events  albert was able to teach theology at the university of paris as a full time professor  holding the seat of the chair of theology at the college of st  james  during this time thomas aquinas began to study under albertus 

albert was the first to comment on virtually all of the writings of aristotle  thus making them accessible to wider academic debate  the study of aristotle brought him to study and comment on the teachings of muslim academics  notably avicenna and averroes  and this would bring him into the heart of academic debate 

in      albert was made provincial of the dominican order  and fulfilled the duties of the office with great care and efficiency  during his tenure he publicly defended the dominicans against attacks by the secular and regular faculty of the university of paris  commented on john the evangelist  and answered what he perceived as errors of the islamic philosopher averroes 

in      albert took part in the general chapter of the dominicans at valenciennes together with thomas aquinas  masters bonushomo britto  florentius  and peter  later pope innocent v  establishing a  ratio studiorum  or program of studies for the dominicans that featured the study of philosophy as an innovation for those not sufficiently trained to study theology  this innovation initiated the tradition of dominican scholastic philosophy put into practice  for example  in      at the order s  studium provinciale  at the convent of santa sabina in rome  out of which would develop the pontifical university of saint thomas aquinas  the  angelicum  

in      pope alexander iv made him bishop of regensburg  an office from which he resigned after three years  during the exercise of his duties he enhanced his reputation for humility by refusing to ride a horse  in accord with the dictates of the order  instead traversing his huge diocese on foot  this earned him the affectionate sobriquet  boots the bishop  from his parishioners  in      pope urban iv relieved him of the duties of bishop and asked him to preach the eighth crusade in german speaking countries  after this  he was especially known for acting as a mediator between conflicting parties  in cologne he is not only known for being the founder of germany s oldest university there  but also for  the big verdict   der gro  e schied  of       which brought an end to the conflict between the citizens of cologne and the archbishop  among the last of his labors was the defense of the orthodoxy of his former pupil  thomas aquinas  whose death in      grieved albert  the story that he travelled to paris in person to defend the teachings of aquinas can not be confirmed  

albert was a scientist  philosopher  astrologer  theologian  spiritual writer  ecumenist  and diplomat  under the auspices of humbert of romans  albert molded the curriculum of studies for all dominican students  introduced aristotle to the classroom and probed the work of neoplatonists  such as plotinus  indeed  it was the thirty years of work done by aquinas and himself that allowed for the inclusion of aristotelian study in the curriculum of dominican schools 

after suffering a collapse of health in       he died on november           in the dominican convent in cologne  germany  since november           his relics are in a roman sarcophagus in the crypt of the dominican st  andreas church in cologne  although his body was discovered to be incorrupt at the first exhumation three years after his death  at the exhumation in      only a skeleton remained 

albert was beatified in       he was canonized and proclaimed a doctor of the church on december           by pope pius xi and the patron saint of natural scientists in       st  albert s feast day is november    

albert s writings collected in      went to thirty eight volumes  these displayed his prolific habits and encyclopedic knowledge of topics such as logic  theology  botany  geography  astronomy  astrology  mineralogy  alchemy  zoology  physiology  phrenology  justice  law  friendship  and love  he digested  interpreted  and systematized the whole of aristotle s works  gleaned from the latin translations and notes of the arabian commentators  in accordance with church doctrine  most modern knowledge of aristotle was preserved and presented by albert 

his principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on the books of the sentences of peter lombard   magister sententiarum    and the  summa theologiae  in two volumes  the latter is in substance a more didactic repetition of the former 

albert s activity  however  was more philosophical than theological  see scholasticism   the philosophical works  occupying the first six and the last of the    volumes  are generally divided according to the aristotelian scheme of the sciences  and consist of interpretations and condensations of aristotle s relative works  with supplementary discussions upon contemporary topics  and occasional divergences from the opinions of the master  albert believed that aristotle s approach to natural philosophy did not pose any obstacle to the development of a christian philosophical view of the natural order 

albert s knowledge of natural science was considerable and for the age remarkably accurate  his industry in every department was great  not only did he produce commentaries and paraphrases of the entire aristotelian corpus  including his scientific works  but albert also added to and improved upon them  his books on topics like botany  zoology  and minerals included information from ancient sources  but also results of his own empirical investigations  these investigations pushed several of the special sciences forward  beyond the reliance on classical texts  in the case of embryology  for example  it has been claimed that little of value was written between aristotle and albert  who managed to identify organs within eggs  furthermore  albert also effectively invented entire special sciences  where aristotle has not covered a topic  for example  prior to albert  there was no systematic study of minerals  for the breadth of these achievements  he was bestowed the name  doctor universalis  

much of albert s empirical contributions to the natural sciences have been superseded  but his general approach to science may be surprisingly modern  for example  in  de mineralibus   book ii  tractate ii  ch     albert claims   for it is  the task  of natural science not simply to accept what we are told but to inquire into the causes of natural things  

in the centuries since his death  many stories arose about albert as an alchemist and magician   much of the modern confusion results from the fact that later works  particularly the alchemical work known as the  secreta alberti  or the  experimenta alberti   were falsely attributed to albertus by their authors to increase the prestige of the text through association   on the subject of alchemy and chemistry  many treatises relating to alchemy have been attributed to him  though in his authentic writings he had little to say on the subject  and then mostly through commentary on aristotle  for example  in his commentary   de mineralibus   he refers to the power of stones  but does not elaborate on what these powers might be  a wide range of pseudo albertine works dealing with alchemy exist  though  showing the belief developed in the generations following albert s death that he had mastered alchemy  one of the fundamental sciences of the middle ages  these include  metals and materials   the  secrets of chemistry   the  origin of metals   the  origins of compounds   and a  concordance  which is a collection of  observations on the philosopher s stone   and other alchemy chemistry topics  collected under the name of  theatrum chemicum   he is credited with the discovery of the element arsenic and experimented with photosensitive chemicals  including silver nitrate  he did believe that stones had occult properties  as he related in his work  de mineralibus   however  there is scant evidence that he personally performed alchemical experiments 

according to legend  albert is said to have discovered the philosopher s stone and passed it on to his pupil thomas aquinas  shortly before his death  albert does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings  but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by  transmutation   given that thomas aquinas died six years before albert s death  this legend as stated is unlikely 

albert was deeply interested in astrology  as has been articulated by scholars such as paola zambelli and scott hendrix  throughout the middle ages     and well into the early modern period    astrology was widely accepted by scientists and intellectuals who held the view that life on earth is effectively a microcosm within the macrocosm  the latter being the cosmos itself   it was believed that correspondence therefore exists between the two and thus the celestial bodies follow patterns and cycles analogous to those on earth  with this worldview  it seemed reasonable to assert that astrology could be used to predict the probable future of a human being  albert argued that an understanding of the celestial influences affecting us could help us to live our lives more in accord with christian precepts  the most comprehensive statement of his astrological beliefs is to be found in a work he authored around       now known as the  speculum astronomiae   however  details of these beliefs can be found in almost everything he wrote  from his early  de natura boni  to his last work  the  summa theologiae  

albert believed that all natural things were compositions of matter and form  he referred to it as  quod est  and  quo est   albert also believed that god alone is the absolute ruling entity  albert s version of hylomorphism is very similar to the aristotelian doctrine 

albert is known for his commentary on the musical practice of his times  most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on aristotle s  poetics   he rejected the idea of  music of the spheres  as ridiculous  movement of astronomical bodies  he supposed  is incapable of generating sound  he wrote extensively on proportions in music  and on the three different subjective levels on which plainchant could work on the human soul  purging of the impure  illumination leading to contemplation  and nourishing perfection through contemplation  of particular interest to   th century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music 

both of his early treatises   de natura boni  and  de bono   start with a metaphysical investigation into the concepts of the good in general and the physical good  albert refers to the physical good as  bonum naturae   albert does this before directly dealing with the moral concepts of metaphysics  in albert s later works  he says in order to understand human or moral goodness  the individual must first recognize what it means to be good and do good deeds  this procedure reflects albert s preoccupations with neo platonic theories of good as well as the doctrines of pseudo dionysius  albert s view was highly valued by the catholic church and his peers 

albert devoted the last tractatus of  de bono  to a theory of justice and natural law  albert places god as the pinnacle of justice and natural law  god legislates and divine authority is supreme  up until his time  it was the only work specifically devoted to natural law written by a theologian or philosopher 

albert mentions friendship in his work   de bono   as well as presenting his ideals and morals of friendship in the very beginning of  tractatus ii   later in his life he published  super ethica   with his development of friendship throughout his work it is evident that friendship ideals and morals took relevance as his life went on  albert comments on aristotle s view of friendship with a quote from cicero  who writes   friendship is nothing other than the harmony between things divine and human  with goodwill and love   albert agrees with this commentary but he also adds in harmony or agreement  albert calls this harmony   consensio   itself a certain kind of movement within the human spirit  albert fully agrees with aristotle in the sense that friendship is a virtue  albert relates the inherent metaphysical contentedness between friendship and moral goodness  albert describes several levels of goodness  the useful   utile    the pleasurable   delectabile   and the authentic or unqualified good   honestum    then in turn there are three levels of friendship based on each of those levels  namely friendship based on usefulness   amicitia utilis    friendship based on pleasure   amicitia delectabilis    and friendship rooted in unqualified goodness   amicitia honesti    amicitia quae fundatur super honestum   

the iconography of the tympanum and archivolts of the late   th century portal of strasbourg cathedral was inspired by albert s writings  albert is frequently mentioned by dante  who made his doctrine of free will the basis of his ethical system  in his  divine comedy   dante places albertus with his pupil thomas aquinas among the great lovers of wisdom   spiriti sapienti   in the heaven of the sun  albert is also mentioned  along with agrippa and paracelsus  in mary shelley s  frankenstein   in which his writings influence a young victor frankenstein 

in  the concept of anxiety   s  ren kierkegaard wrote that albert   arrogantly boasted of his speculation before the deity and suddenly became stupid   kierkegaard cites gotthard oswald marbach whom he quotes as saying   albertus repente ex asino factus philosophus et ex philosopho asinus    albert was suddenly transformed from an ass into a philosopher and from a philosopher into an ass  

johann eduard erdmann considers albert greater and more original than his pupil aquinas

alboin

alboin     sjune          was king of the lombards from about     until      during his reign the lombards ended their migrations by settling in italy  the northern part of which alboin conquered between     and      he had a lasting effect on italy and the pannonian basin  in the former his invasion marked the beginning of centuries of lombard rule  and in the latter his defeat of the gepids and his departure from pannonia ended the dominance there of the germanic peoples 

the period of alboin s reign as king in pannonia following the death of his father  audoin  was one of confrontation and conflict between the lombards and their main neighbors  the gepids  the gepids initially gained the upper hand  but in      thanks to his alliance with the avars  alboin inflicted a decisive defeat on his enemies  whose lands the avars subsequently occupied  the increasing power of his new neighbours caused alboin some unease however  and he therefore decided to leave pannonia for italy  hoping to take advantage of the byzantine empire s reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the gothic war 

after gathering a large coalition of peoples  alboin crossed the julian alps in      entering an almost undefended italy  he rapidly took control of most of venetia and liguria  in      unopposed  he took northern italy s main city  milan  pavia offered stiff resistance however  and was taken only after a siege lasting three years  during that time alboin turned his attention to tuscany  but signs of factionalism among his supporters and alboin s diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves 

alboin was assassinated on june          in a coup d   tat instigated by the byzantines  it was organized by the king s foster brother  helmichis  with the support of alboin s wife  rosamund  daughter of the gepid king whom alboin had killed some years earlier  the coup failed in the face of opposition from a majority of the lombards  who elected cleph as alboin s successor  forcing helmichis and rosamund to flee to ravenna under imperial protection  alboin s death deprived the lombards of the only leader who could have kept the newborn germanic entity together  the last in the line of hero kings who had led the lombards through their migrations from the vale of the elbe to italy  for many centuries following his death alboin s heroism and his success in battle were celebrated in saxon and bavarian epic poetry 

the lombards under king wacho had migrated towards the east into pannonia  taking advantage of the difficulties facing the ostrogothic kingdom in italy following the death of its founder  theodoric in      wacho s death in about     brought his son walthari to the throne  but as the latter was still a minor the kingdom was governed in his stead by alboin s father  audoin  of the gausian clan  seven years later walthari died  giving audoin the opportunity to crown himself and overthrow the reigning lethings 

alboin was probably born in the    s in pannonia  the son of audoin and his wife  rodelinda  she may have been the niece of king theodoric and betrothed to audoin through the mediation of emperor justinian  like his father  alboin was raised a pagan  although audoin had at one point attempted to gain byzantine support against his neighbours by professing himself a christian  alboin took as his first wife the christian chlothsind  daughter of the frankish king chlothar  this marriage  which took place soon after the death of the frankish ruler theudebald in      is thought to reflect audoin s decision to distance himself from the byzantines  traditional allies of the lombards  who had been lukewarm when it came to supporting audoin against the gepids  the new frankish alliance was important because of the franks  known hostility to the byzantine empire  providing the lombards with more than one option  however  the  prosopography of the later roman empire  interprets events and sources differently  believing that alboin married chlothsind when already a king in or shortly before      the year of chlothar s death 

alboin first distinguished himself on the battlefield in a clash with the gepids  at the battle of asfeld        he killed turismod  son of the gepid king thurisind  in a victory that resulted in the emperor justinian s intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers  after the battle  according to a tradition reported by paul the deacon  to be granted the right to sit at his father s table  alboin had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king and have him donate his weapons  as was customary  for this initiation  he went to the court of thurisind  where the gepid king gave him turismod s arms  walter goffart believes it is probable that in this narrative paul was making use of an oral tradition  and is sceptical that it can be dismissed as merely a typical  topos  of an epic poem 

alboin came to the throne after the death of his father  sometime between     and      as was customary among the lombards  alboin took the crown after an election by the tribe s freemen  who traditionally selected the king from the dead sovereign s clan  shortly afterwards  in      a new war erupted with the gepids  now led by cunimund  thurisind s son  the cause of the conflict is uncertain  as the sources are divided  the lombard paul the deacon accuses the gepids  while the byzantine historian menander protector places the blame on alboin  an interpretation favoured by historian walter pohl 

an account of the war by the byzantine theophylact simocatta sentimentalises the reasons behind the conflict  claiming it originated with alboin s vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of cunimund s daughter rosamund  that alboin proceeded then to marry  the tale is treated with scepticism by walter goffart  who observes that it conflicts with the  origo gentis langobardorum   where she was captured only after the death of her father  the gepids obtained the support of the emperor in exchange for a promise to cede him the region of sirmium  the seat of the gepid kings  thus in     or     justinian s successor justin ii sent his son in law baduarius as  magister militum   field commander  to lead a byzantine army against alboin in support of cunimund  ending in the lombards  complete defeat 

faced with the possibility of annihilation  alboin made an alliance in     with the avars under bayan i  at the expense of some tough conditions  the avars demanded a tenth of the lombards  cattle  half of the war booty  and on the war s conclusion all of the lands held by the gepids  the lombards played on the pre existing hostility between the avars and the byzantines  claiming that the latter were allied with the gepids  cunimund  on the other hand  encountered hostility when he once again asked the emperor for military assistance  as the byzantines had been angered by the gepids  failure to cede sirmium to them  as had been agreed  moreover  justin ii was moving away from the foreign policy of justinian  and believed in dealing more strictly with bordering states and peoples  attempts to mollify justin ii with tributes failed  and as a result the byzantines kept themselves neutral if not outright supportive of the avars 

in     the allies made their final move against cunimund  with alboin invading the gepids  lands from the northwest while bayan attacked from the northeast  cunimund attempted to prevent the two armies joining up by moving against the lombards and clashing with alboin somewhere between the tibiscus and danube rivers  the gepids were defeated in the ensuing battle  their king slain by alboin  and cunimund s daughter rosamund taken captive  according to references in the  origo   the full destruction of the gepid kingdom was completed by the avars  who overcame the gepids in the east  as a result  the gepids ceased to exist as an independent people  and were partly absorbed by the lombards and the avars  some time before      alboin s first wife chlothsind died  and after his victory against cunimund alboin married rosamund  to establish a bond with the remaining gepids  the war also marked a watershed in the geo political history of the region  as together with the lombard migration the following year  it signalled the end of six centuries of germanic dominance in the pannonian basin 

despite his success against the gepids  alboin had failed to greatly increase his power  and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the avars  historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing alboin to undertake a migration  even though there are indications that before the war with the gepids a decision was maturing to leave for italy  a country thousands of lombards had seen in the    s when hired by the byzantines to fight in the gothic war  additionally  the lombards would have known of the weakness of byzantine italy  which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the goths  in particular the so called plague of justinian had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic  with the three chapter controversy sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula  narses  was recalled  nevertheless  the lombards viewed italy as a rich land which promised great booty  assets alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only lombards but many other peoples of the region  including heruli  suebi  gepids  thuringii  bulgars  sarmatians  the remaining romans and a few ostrogoths  but the most important group  other than the lombards  were the saxons  of whom        male warriors with their families participated in the trek  these saxons were tributaries to the frankish king sigebert  and their participation indicates that alboin had the support of the franks for his venture 

the precise size of the heterogeneous group gathered by alboin is impossible to know  and many different estimates have been made  neil christie considers         to be a realistic size  a number which would make the lombards a more numerous force than the ostrogoths on the eve of their invasion of italy  j  rg jarnut proposes                   as an approximation  wilfried menghen in  die langobarden  estimates         to          while stefano gasparri cautiously judges the peoples united by alboin to be somewhere between         and         

as a precautionary move alboin strengthened his alliance with the avars  signing what paul calls a  foedus perpetuum    perpetual treaty   and what is referred to in the  th century  historia langobardorum codicis gothani  as a  pactum et foedus amicitiae    pact and treaty of friendship    adding that the treaty was put down on paper  by the conditions accepted in the treaty  the avars were to take possession of pannonia and the lombards were promised military support in italy should the need arise  also  for a period of      years the lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer italy failed  thus leaving alboin with an alternative open  the accord also had the advantage of protecting alboin s rear  as an avar occupied pannonia would make it difficult for the byzantines to bring forces to italy by land  the agreement proved immensely successful  and relations with the avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the lombard kingdom 

a further cause of the lombard migration into italy may have been an invitation from narses  according to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources  narses  out of spite for having been removed by justinian s successor justin ii  called the lombards to italy  often dismissed as an unreliable tradition  it has been studied with attention by modern scholars  in particular neil christie  who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the byzantine state to settle in northern italy as  foederati   to help protect the region against the franks  an arrangement that may have been disowned by justin ii after narses  removal 

the lombard migration started on easter monday  april         the decision to combine the departure with a christian celebration can be understood in the context of alboin s recent conversion to arian christianity  as attested by the presence of arian gothic missionaries at his court  the conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly from political considerations  and intended to consolidate the migration s cohesion  distinguishing them from the catholic romans  it also connected alboin and his people to the gothic heritage  and in this way obtain the support of the ostrogoths serving in the byzantine army as  foederati   it has been speculated that alboin s migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving ostrogoths in italy 

the season chosen for leaving pannonia was unusually early  the germanic peoples generally waited until autumn before beginning a migration  giving themselves time to do the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march  the reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring avars  despite the friendship treaty  nomadic peoples like the avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns  as they needed enough forage for their horses  a sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by alboin to ravage pannonia  which created a safety zone between the lombards and the avars 

the road followed by alboin to reach italy has been the subject of controversy  as is the length of the trek  according to neil christie the lombards divided themselves into migrational groups  with a vanguard scouting the road  probably following the poetovio     celeia     emona     forum iulii route  while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and chattels they brought with them  and possibly also because they were waiting for the saxons to join them on the road  by september raiding parties were looting venetia  but it was probably only in     that the julian alps were crossed at the vipava valley  the eyewitness secundus of non gives the date as may    or     the     date for the entry into italy is not void of difficulties however  and j  rg jarnut believes the conquest of most of venetia had already been completed in      according to carlo guido mor  a major difficulty remains in explaining how alboin could have reached milan on september   assuming he had passed the border only in the may of the same year 

the lombards penetrated into italy without meeting any resistance from the border troops   milities limitanei    the byzantine military resources available on the spot were scant and of dubious loyalty  and the border forts may well have been left unmanned  what seems certain is that archaeological excavations have found no sign of violent confrontation in the sites that have been excavated  this agrees with paul the deacon s narrative  who speaks of a lombard takeover in friuli  without any hindrance  

the first town to fall into the lombards  hands was forum iulii  cividale del friuli   the seat of the local  magister militum   alboin chose this walled town close to the frontier to be capital of the duchy of friuli and made his nephew and shield bearer  gisulf  duke of the region  with the specific duty of defending the borders from byzantine or avar attacks from the east  gisulf obtained from his uncle the right to choose for his duchy those  farae   or clans  that he preferred 

alboin s decision to create a duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations  until then  the lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town  the innovation adopted was part of alboin s borrowing of roman and ostrogothic administrative models  as in late antiquity the  comes civitatis   city count  was the main local authority  with full administrative powers in his region  but the shift from count   comes   to duke   dux   and from county   comitatus   to duchy   ducatus   also signalled the progressive militarization of italy  the selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in pannonia  for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the lombards  now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in forum iulii  a pattern that was repeated regularly by the lombards in their other duchies 

from forum iulii  alboin next reached aquileia  the most important road junction in the northeast  and the administrative capital of venetia  the imminent arrival of the lombards had a considerable impact on the city s population  the patriarch of aquileia paulinus fled with his clergy and flock to the island of grado in byzantine controlled territory 

from aquileia  alboin took the via postumia and swept through venetia  taking in rapid succession tarvisium  treviso   vicentia  vicenza   verona  brixia  brescia  and bergomum  bergamo   the lombards faced difficulties only in taking opitergium  oderzo   which alboin decided to avoid  as he similarly avoided tackling the main venetian towns closer to the coast on the via annia  such as altinum  patavium  padova   mons silicis  monselice   mantua and cremona  the invasion of venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil  spurring waves of refugees from the lombard controlled interior to the byzantine held coast  often led by their bishops  and resulting in new settlements such as torcello and heraclia 

alboin moved west in his march  invading the region of liguria  north west italy  and reaching its capital mediolanum  milan  on september         only to find it already abandoned by the  vicarius italiae   vicar of italy   the authority entrusted with the administration of the diocese of annonarian italy  archbishop honoratus  his clergy  and part of the laity accompanied the  vicarius italiae  to find a safe haven in the byzantine port of genua  genoa   alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of milan  when he assumed the title of  dominus italiae   lord of italy   his success also meant the collapse of byzantine defences in the northern part of the po plain  and large movements of refugees to byzantine areas 

several explanations have been advanced to explain the swiftness and ease of the initial lombard advance in northern italy  it has been suggested that the towns  doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the gothic auxiliaries in the byzantine army  but historians generally hold that lombard success occurred because italy was not considered by byzantium as a vital part of the empire  especially at a time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of avars and slavs in the balkans and sassanids in the east  the byzantine decision not to contest the lombard invasion reflects the desire of justinian s successors to reorient the core of the empire s policies eastward 

the impact of the lombard migration on the late roman aristocracy was disruptive  especially in combination with the gothic war  the latter conflict had finished in the north only in      when the last gothic stronghold  verona  was taken  many men of means  paul s  possessores   either lost their lives or their goods  but the exact extent of the despoliation of the roman aristocracy is a subject of heated debate  the clergy was also greatly affected  the lombards were mostly pagans  and displayed little respect for the clergy and church property  many churchmen left their sees to escape from the lombards  like the two most senior bishops in the north  honoratus and paulinus  however  most of the suffragan bishops in the north sought an accommodation with the lombards  as did in     the bishop of tarvisium felix when he journeyed to the piave river to parley with alboin  obtaining respect for the church and its goods in return for this act of homage  it seems certain that many sees maintained an uninterrupted episcopal succession through the turmoil of the invasion and the following years  the transition was eased by the hostility existing among the northern italian bishops towards the papacy and the empire due to the religious dispute involving the  three chapter controversy   in lombard territory  churchmen were at least sure to avoid imperial religious persecution 

in the view of pierre rich    the disappearance of     bishops  seats indicates that the lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the church  yet according to walter pohl the regions directly occupied by alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns  whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact  with the bishoprics in such places rarely surviving 

the first attested instance of strong resistance to alboin s migration took place at the town of ticinum  pavia   which he started to besiege in     and captured only after three years  the town was of strategic importance  sitting at the confluence of the rivers po and ticino and connected by waterways to ravenna  the capital of byzantine italy and the seat of the praetorian prefecture of italy  its fall cut direct communications between the garrisons stationed on the alpes maritimae and the adriatic coast 

careful to maintain the initiative against the byzantines  by     alboin had taken their last defences in northern italy except for the coastal areas of liguria and venetia and a few isolated inland centres such as augusta praetoria  aosta   segusio  susa   and the island of amacina in the larius lucus  lake como   during alboin s kingship the lombards crossed the apennines and plundered tuscia  but historians are not in full agreement as to whether this took place under his guidance and if this constituted anything more than raiding  according to herwig wolfram  it was probably only in           that tuscany was conquered  but j  rg jarnut and others believe this began in some form under alboin  although it was not completed by the time of his death 

alboin s problems in maintaining control over his people worsened during the siege of ticinum  the nature of the lombard monarchy made it difficult for a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by theodoric over his goths  and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or  duces   who led each band   fara   of warriors  additionally  the difficulties encountered by alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy  as unlike the ostrogoths  they had not entered italy as  foederati  but as enemies of the empire 

the king s disintegrating authority over his army was also manifested in the invasion of frankish burgundy which from     or     was subject to yearly raids on a major scale  the lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following mummolus  victory at embrun  these attacks had lasting political consequences  souring the previously cordial lombard frankish relations and opening the door to an alliance between the empire and the franks against the lombards  a coalition agreed to by guntram in about      alboin is generally thought not to have been behind this invasion  but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by gian piero bognetti is that alboin may actually have been involved in the offensive on guntram as part of an alliance with the frankish king of austrasia  sigebert i  this view is met with scepticism by scholars such as chris wickham 

the weakening of royal authority may also have resulted in the conquest of much of southern italy by the lombards  in which modern scholars believe alboin played no role at all  probably taking place in     or     under the auspices of individual warlords  however it is far from certain that the lombard takeover occurred during those years  as very little is known of faroald and zotto s respective rise to power in spoletium  spoleto  and beneventum  benevento  

ticinum eventually fell to the lombards in either may or june      alboin had in the meantime chosen verona as his seat  establishing himself and his treasure in a royal palace built there by theodoric  this choice may have been another attempt to link himself with the gothic king 

it was in this palace that alboin was killed on june          in the account given by paul the deacon  the most detailed narrative on alboin s death  history and saga intermingle almost inextricably  much earlier and shorter is the story told by marius of aventicum in his  chronica   written about a decade after alboin s murder  according to his version the king was killed in a conspiracy by a man close to him  called hilmegis  paul s helmechis   with the connivance of the queen  helmichis then married the widow  but the two were forced to escape to byzantine ravenna  taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army  which hints at the cooperation of byzantium  roger collins describes marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to lombard italy 

also contemporary is gregory of tours  account presented in the  historia francorum   and echoed by the later fredegar  gregory s account diverges in several respects from most other sources  in his tale it is told how alboin married the daughter of a man he had slain  and how she waited for a suitable occasion for revenge  eventually poisoning him  she had previously fallen in love with one of her husband s servants  and after the assassination tried to escape with him  but they were captured and killed  however  historians including walter goffart place little trust in this narrative  goffart notes other similar doubtful stories in the  historia  and calls its account of alboin s demise  a suitably ironic tale of the doings of depraved humanity  

elements present in marius  account are echoed in paul s  historia langobardorum   which also contains distinctive features  one of the best known aspects unavailable in any other source is that of the skull cup  in paul  the events that led to alboin s downfall unfold in verona  during a great feast  alboin gets drunk and orders his wife rosamund to drink from his cup  made from the skull of his father in law cunimund after he had slain him in     and married rosamund  alboin  invited her to drink merrily with her father   this reignited the queen s determination to avenge her father 
the tale has been often dismissed as a fable and paul was conscious of the risk of disbelief  for this reason  he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the    s in the royal palace of ticinum in the hands of king ratchis  the use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and  in particular  among the lombards  neighbors  the avars  skull cups are believed to be part of a shamanistic ritual  where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man s powers  in this context  stefano gasparri and wilfried menghen see in cunimund s skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the lombards  by drinking from his enemy s skull alboin was taking his vital strength  as for the offering of the skull to rosamund  that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the lombards  and thus a cause of shame or humiliation  alternatively  it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation  in the latter interpretation  the queen s answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act  thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge 

the episode is read in a radically different way by walter goffart  according to him  the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning  with paul intent on telling an edifying story of the downfall of the hero and his expulsion from the promised land  because of his human weakness  in this story  the skull cup plays a key role as it unites original sin and barbarism  goffart does not exclude the possibility that paul had really seen the skull  but believes that by the    s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established 

in her plan to kill her husband she found an ally in helmichis  the king s foster brother and  spatharius   arms bearer   according to paul the queen then recruited the king s  cubicularius   bedchamberlain   peredeo  into the plot  after having seduced him  when alboin retired for his midday rest on june     care was taken to leave the door open and unguarded  alboin s sword was also removed  leaving him defenceless when peredeo entered his room and killed him  alboin s remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps 

peredeo s figure and role is mostly introduced by paul  the  origo  had for the first time mentioned his name as  peritheus   but there his role had been different  as he was not the assassin  but the instigator of the assassination  in the vein of his reading of the skull cup  goffart sees peredeo as not as a historical figure but as an allegorical character  he notes a similarity between peredeo s name and the latin word  peritus   meaning  lost   a representation of those lombards who entered into the service of the empire 

alboin s death had a lasting impact  as it deprived the lombards of the only leader they had that could have kept together the newborn germanic entity  his end also represents the death of the last of the line of the hero kings that had led the lombards through their migrations from the elba to italy  his fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry  with saxons and bavarians celebrating his prowess in battle  his heroism  and the magical properties of his weapons 

to complete the coup d   tat and legitimize his claim to the throne  helmichis married the queen  whose high standing arose not only from being the king s widow but also from being the most prominent member of the remaining gepid nation  and as such her support was a guarantee of the gepids  loyalty to helmichis  the latter could also count on the support of the lombard garrison of verona  where many may have opposed alboin s aggressive policy and could have cultivated the hope of reaching an entente with the empire  the byzantines were almost certainly deeply involved in the plot  it was in their interest to stem the lombard tide by bringing a pro byzantine regime into power in verona  and possibly in the long run break the unity of the lombards  kingdom  winning over the dukes with honors and emoluments 

the coup ultimately failed  as it met with the resistance of most of the warriors  who were opposed to the king s assassination  as a result  the lombard garrison in ticinum proclaimed duke cleph the new king  and helmichis  rather than going to war against overwhelming odds  escaped to ravenna with longinus  assistance  taking with him his wife  his troops  the royal treasure and alboin s daughter albsuinda  in ravenna the two lovers became estranged and killed each other  subsequently  longinus sent albsuinda and the treasure to constantinople 

cleph kept the throne for only    months before being assassinated by a slave  possibly he too was killed at the instigation of the byzantines  who had every interest in avoiding a hostile and solid leadership among the lombards  an important success for the byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed cleph  opening a decade of interregnum  thus making them more vulnerable to attacks from franks and byzantines  it was only when faced with the danger of annihilation by the franks in     that the dukes elected a new king in the person of authari  son of cleph  who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the lombard kingdom while the remaining imperial territories were reorganized under the control of an exarch in ravenna with the capacity to defend the country without the emperor s assistance 

the consolidation of byzantine and lombard dominions had long lasting consequences for italy  as the region was from that moment on fragmented among multiple rulers until italian unification in      

alboin  together with other tribal leaders in mentioned in the   th century old english poem called  widsith   lines         
the historical period also formed the basis of the      italian adventure film  sword of the conqueror   italian   rosmunda e alboino   german title  alboin  k  nig der langobarden    with jack palance as alboin 

there have been several artistic depictions of events from alboin s life including peter paul reubens   alboin and rosamunde          charles landseer s  assassination of alboin  king of the lombards          and fortunino matania s illustration  rosamund captive before king alboin of the lombards         





afonso de albuquerque

afonso de albuquerque  duke of goa                december        also spelled aphonso or alfonso   was a portuguese general  a  great conqueror   a statesman  and an empire builder 

afonso advanced the three fold portuguese grand scheme of combating islam  spreading christianity  and securing the trade of spices by establishing a portuguese asian empire  among his achievements  afonso managed to conquer the island of goa and was the first european of his renaissance to raid the persian gulf  and he led the first voyage by a european fleet into the red sea  his military and administrative works are generally regarded as among the most vital to building and securing the portuguese empire in the orient  the middle east  and the spice routes of eastern oceania 

afonso is generally considered a military genius  and  probably the greatest naval commander of the age  given his successful strategy   he attempted to close all the indian ocean naval passages to the atlantic  red sea  persian gulf  and to the pacific  transforming it into a portuguese  mare clausum  established over the opposition of the ottoman empire and its muslim and hindu allies  in the expansion of the portuguese empire  afonso initiated a rivalry that would become known as the ottoman   portuguese war  which would endure for many years  many of the ottoman   portuguese conflicts in which he was directly involved took place in the indian ocean  in the persian gulf regions for control of the trade routes  and on the coasts of india  it was his military brilliance in these initial campaigns against the much larger ottoman empire and its allies that enabled portugal to become the first global empire in history  he had a record of engaging and defeating much larger armies and fleets  for example  his capture of ormuz in      against the persians was accomplished with a fleet of seven ships  other famous battles and offensives which he led include the conquest of goa in      and the capture of malacca in       he became admiral of the indian ocean  and was appointed head of the  fleet of the arabian and persian sea  in      

during the last five years of his life  he turned to administration  where his actions as the second governor of portuguese india were crucial to the longevity of the portuguese empire  he pioneered european sea trade with china during the ming dynasty with envoy rafael perestrello  thailand with duarte fernandes as envoy  and with timor  passing through malaysia and indonesia in a voyage headed by ant  nio de abreu and francisco serr  o  he also aided diplomatic relations with ethiopia using priest envoys jo  o gomes and jo  o sanches  and established diplomatic ties with persia  during the safavid dynasty 

he became known as  the great    the terrible    the caesar of the east    the lion of the seas   and  the portuguese mars  

afonso de albuquerque was born in      in alhandra  near lisbon  he was the second son of gon  alo de albuquerque  lord of vila verde dos francos  and dona leonor de menezes  his father held an important position at court and was connected by remote illegitimate descent with the portuguese monarchy  he was educated in mathematics and latin at the court of afonso v of portugal  where he befriended prince john  the future king john ii of portugal 

afonso s early training is described by diogo barbosa machado 
    d  alfonso de albuquerque  surnamed the great  by reason of the heroic deeds wherewith he filled europe with admiration  and asia with fear and trembling  was born in the year       in the estate called  for the loveliness of its situation  the paradise of the town of alhandra  six leagues distant from lisbon  he was the second son of gon  alo de albuquerque  lord of villaverde  and of d  leonor de menezes  daughter of d    lvaro gon  alves de athayde  count of atouguia  and of his wife d  guiomar de castro  and corrected this injustice of nature by climbing to the summit of every virtue  both political and moral  he was educated in the palace of the king d  afonso v  in whose palaestra he strove emulously to become the rival of that african mars    

afonso served    years in north africa  where he gained military experience in fierce campaigns against muslim powers and ottoman turks 

in       under the command of afonso v of portugal  he was present at the conquest of tangier and arzila in morocco  serving there as an officer for some years  in      he accompanied prince john in wars against castile  including the battle of toro  he participated in the campaign on the italian peninsula in      to rescue ferdinand ii of aragon from the ottoman invasion of otranto that ended in victory  on his return in       when prince john was crowned as king john ii  afonso was made master of the horse for his distinguished exploits  chief equerry   estribeiro mor   to the king  a post which he held throughout john s reign              in      he returned to military campaigns in north africa  as commander of defense in the graciosa fortress  an island in the river luco near the city of larache  and in      was part of the guard of king john ii  returning to arzila in       where his younger brother martim died fighting by his side 

afonso made his mark under the stern john ii  and won military campaigns in africa and the mediterranean sea  yet asia is where he would make his greatest impact 

when king manuel i of portugal was enthroned  he showed some reticence towards afonso  a close friend of his dreaded predecessor and seventeen years his senior  eight years later  on   april       after a long military career and at a mature age  afonso was sent on his first expedition to india together with his cousin francisco de albuquerque  each commanded three ships  sailing with duarte pacheco pereira and nicolau coelho  they engaged in several battles against the forces of the zamorin of calicut   calecute   kozhikode  and succeeded in establishing the king of cohin   cohim   kochi  securely on his throne  in return  the king gave them permission to build the portuguese fort  immanuel   fort kochi  and establish trade relations with quilon   coul  o   kollam   this laid the foundation for the eastern portuguese empire 

afonso returned home in july       and was well received by king manuel i  after he assisted with the creation of a strategy for the portuguese efforts in the east  king manuel entrusted him with the command of a squadron of five vessels in the fleet of sixteen sailing for india in early      headed by trist  o da cunha 
their aim was to conquer socotra and build a fortress there  hoping to close the trade in the red sea 
afonso went as  chief captain for the coast of arabia   sailing under da cunha s orders until reaching mozambique  he carried a sealed letter with a secret mission ordered by the king  after fulfilling the first mission  he was to replace the first viceroy of india  francisco de almeida  whose term ended two years later  before departing  he legitimized a natural son born in       and made his will 

the fleet left lisbon on   april       afonso piloted his ship himself  having lost his appointed pilot on departure  in mozambique channel  they rescued captain jo  o da nova  who had encountered difficulties on his return from india  da nova and his ship  the  frol de la mar   joined da cunha s fleet  from malindi  da cunha sent envoys to ethiopia  which at the time was thought to be closer than it actually is  those included the priest jo  o gomes  jo  o sanches and tunisian sid mohammed who  having failed to cross the region  headed for socotra  from there  afonso managed to land them in filuk 
after successful attacks on arab cities on the east africa coast  they conquered socotra and built a fortress at suq  hoping to establish a base to stop the red sea commerce to the indian ocean  however  socotra was abandoned four years later  as it was not advantageous as a base 

at socotra  they parted ways  trist  o da cunha sailed for india  where he would relieve the portuguese besieged at cannanore  while afonso took seven ships and     men to ormuz in the persian gulf  one of the chief eastern centers of commerce  on his way  he conquered the cities of curiati  kuryat   muscat in july       and khor fakkan  accepting the submission of the cities of kalhat and sohar  he arrived at ormuz on    september and soon captured the city  which agreed to become a tributary state of the portuguese king  

hormuz was then a tributary state of shah ismail of persia  in a famous episode  shortly after its conquest albuquerque was confronted by persian envoys  who demanded the payment of the due tribute from him instead  he ordered them to be given a stock of cannonballs  arrows and weapons  retorting that  such was the currency struck in portugal to pay the tribute demanded from the dominions of king manuel 

according to br  s de albuquerque  it was shah ismael who coined the term  lion of the seas   addressing albuquerque as such  afonso began building the fort of our lady of victory  later renamed fort of our lady of the conception   engaging his men of all ranks in the work 

however  some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate and  claiming that afonso was exceeding his orders  departed for india  with the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies  he was unable to maintain this position for long  forced to abandon ormuz in january       he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of socotra  returned to ormuz  and then headed to india 

afonso arrived at cannanore on the malabar coast in december       where he opened before the viceroy  dom francisco de almeida  the sealed letter which he had received from the king  and which named as governor to succeed almeida 
the viceroy  supported by the officers who had abandoned afonso at ormuz  had a matching royal order  but declined to yield  protesting that his term ended only in january and stating his intention to avenge his son s death by fighting the mamluk fleet of mirocem  refusing afonso s offer to fight him himself  afonso avoided confrontation  which could have led to civil war  and moved to kochi  india  to await further instruction from the king  maintaining his entourage himself  he was described by fern  o lopes de castanheda as patiently enduring open opposition from the group that had gathered around almeida  with whom he kept formal contact  increasingly isolated  he wrote to diogo lopes de sequeira  who arrived in india with a new fleet  but was ignored as sequeira joined the viceroy  at the same time  afonso refused approaches from opponents of the viceroy  who encouraged him to seize power 

on   february       almeida fought the naval battle of diu against a joint fleet of mamluks  ottomans  the zamorin of calicut  and the sultan of gujarat  regarding it as personal revenge for the death of his son  his victory was decisive  the ottomans and mamluks abandoned the indian ocean  easing the way for portuguese rule there for the next century  in august  after a petition from afonso s former officers with the support of diogo lopes de sequeira claiming him unfit for governance  afonso was sent in custody to st  angelo fort in cannanore  there he remained under what he considered to be imprisonment 

in september       sequeira tried to establish contact with the sultan of malacca but failed  leaving behind    portuguese prisoners 

afonso was released after three months  confinement  on the arrival at cannanore of the marshal of portugal with a large fleet 
the portuguese marshal was the most important portuguese noble ever to visit india and he brought an armada of fifteen ships and       men sent by the king to defend afonso s rights  and to take calicut 

on   november       afonso became the second governor of the state of india  a position he would hold until his death  almeida having returned home in       afonso speedily showed the energy and determination of his character  he intended to dominate the muslim world and control the spice trade 

initially king manuel i and his council in lisbon tried to distribute the power  outlining three areas of jurisdiction in the indian ocean  in       the nobleman diogo lopes de sequeira was sent with a fleet to southeast asia  to seek an agreement with sultan mahmud shah of malacca  but failed and returned to portugal  to jorge de aguiar was given the region between the cape of good hope and gujarat  he was succeeded by duarte de lemos  but left for cochin and then for portugal  leaving his fleet to afonso 

in january       obeying the orders from the king and aware of the absence of zamorin  afonso advanced on calicut  the attack was unsuccessful  as marshal fernando coutinho ventured into the inner city against instructions  fascinated by its richness  and was ambushed  during the rescue  afonso was shot in the chest and had to retreat  barely escaping with his life  coutinho was killed during the escape  

soon after the failed attack  afonso assembled a fleet of    ships and      men  contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the egyptian mamluk sultanate fleet in the red sea or return to hormuz  however  he had been informed by timoji  a privateer in the service of the hindu vijayanagara empire  that it would be easier to fight them in goa  where they had sheltered after the battle of diu  and also of the illness of the sultan yusuf adil shah  and war between the deccan sultanates  so he relied on surprise in the capture of goa from the sultanate of bijapur  he thus completed another mission  for portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal  guest  of kochi and had been coveting goa as the best trading port in the region 

a first assault took place in goa from   march to    may       after initial occupation  feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications  the cooling of hindu residents  support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by ismail adil shah  afonso refused a truce offered by the sultan and abandoned the city in august  his fleet was scattered  and a palace revolt in kochi hindered his recovery  so he headed to fort anjediva  new ships arrived from portugal  which were intended for the nobleman diogo mendes de vasconcelos at malacca  who had been given a rival command of the region 

three months later  on    november afonso reappeared at goa with a renovated fleet  diogo mendes de vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for malacca and about     malabari reinforcements from cannanore  in less than a day  they took goa from ismail adil shah and his ottoman allies  who surrendered on    december  it is estimated that      of the      muslim defenders of the city died  either in the fierce battle in the streets or by drowning while trying to escape  afonso regained the support of the hindu population  although he frustrated the initial expectations of timoji  who aspired to become governor  afonso rewarded him by appointing him chief  aguazil  of the city  an administrator and representative of the hindu and muslim people  as a knowledgeable interpreter of the local customs  he then made an agreement to lower the yearly tribute 

in goa  afonso established the first portuguese mint in the east  after timoja s merchants had complained of the scarcity of currency  taking it as an opportunity to solidify the territorial conquest  the new coin  based on the existing local coins  showed a cross on the obverse and an armillary sphere  or  esfera    king manuel s badge  on the reverse  gold cruzados or  manueis   silver  esferas  and  alf esferas   and bronze  leais  were issued  another mint was established at malacca in      

albuquerque founded at goa the  hospital real de goa  or royal hospital of goa  by the church of santa catarina  upon hearing that the doctors were extorting the sickly with excessive fees  albuquerque summoned them  declaring that  you charge a physicians  pay and don t know what disease the men who serve our lord the king suffer from  thus  i want to teach you what is it that they die from  and put them to work building the city walls all day till nightfall before releasing them 

despite constant attacks  goa became the center of portuguese india  with the conquest triggering the compliance of neighbouring kingdoms  the sultan of gujarat and the zamorin of calicut sent embassies  offering alliances and local grants to fortify 

afonso then used goa to secure the spice trade in favor of portugal and sell persian horses to vijayanagara and hindu princes in return for their assistance 

afonso explained to his armies why the portuguese wanted to capture malacca 

in february       through a friendly hindu merchant  nina chatu  afonso received a letter from rui de ara  jo  one of the nineteen portuguese held at malacca since       it urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release  and gave details of the fortifications  afonso showed it to diogo mendes de vasconcelos  as an argument to advance in a joint fleet  in april       after fortifying goa  he gathered a force of about     portuguese      hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships  he then sailed to malacca against orders and despite the protest of diogo mendes  who claimed command of the expedition  afonso eventually centralized the portuguese government in the indian ocean  after the malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the king to explain his disagreement with diogo mendes  suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the portuguese in india  under his command was ferdinand magellan  who had participated in the failed embassy of diogo lopes de sequeira in      

after a false start towards the red sea  they sailed to the strait of malacca  it was the richest city that the portuguese tried to take  and a focal point in the trade network where malay traders met gujarati  chinese  japanese  javanese  bengali  persian and arabic  among others  described by tom   pires as of invaluable richness  despite its wealth  it was mostly a wooden built city  with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at        men and more than      pieces of artillery  its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of sultan mahmud shah  who favoured muslims  arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants 

afonso made a bold approach to the city  his ships decorated with banners  firing cannon volleys  he declared himself lord of all the navigation  demanded the sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages  and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post  the sultan eventually freed the prisoners  but was unimpressed by the small portuguese contingent  afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration  the city being divided by the malacca river  the connecting bridge was a strategic point  so at dawn on    july the portuguese landed and fought a tough battle  facing poisoned arrows  taking the bridge in the evening  after fruitlessly waiting for the sultan s reaction  they returned to the ships and prepared a junk  offered by chinese merchants   filling it with men  artillery and sandbags  commanded by ant  nio de abreu  it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge  the day after  all had landed  after a fierce fight during which the sultan appeared with an army of war elephants  the defenders were dispersed and the sultan fled  afonso waited for the reaction of the sultan  merchants approached  asking for portuguese protection  they were given banners to mark their premises  a sign that they would not be looted  on    august  the portuguese attacked again  but the sultan had fled the city  under strict orders  they looted the city  but respected the banners 
afonso prepared malacca s defenses against a malay counterattack  building a fortress  assigning his men to shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery  despite the delays caused by heat and malaria  it was completed in november       its surviving door now known as  a famosa    the famous    it was possibly then that afonso had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest  to quell disagreements over the order of the names  he had it set facing the wall  with the single inscription  lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes   latin for  the stone the builders rejected   from david s prophecy  psalm              on the front 

he settled the portuguese administration  reappointing rui de ara  jo as factor  a post assigned before his      arrest  and appointing rich merchant nina chatu to replace the previous  bendahara   representative of the  kafir  people and adviser  besides assisting in the governance of the city and first portuguese coinage  he provided the junks for several diplomatic missions  meanwhile  afonso arrested and had executed the powerful javanese merchant utimuti raja who  after being appointed to a position in the portuguese administration as representative of the javanese population  had maintained contacts with the exiled royal family 

afonso arranged for the shipping of many   rf  s d el rei to portuguese malacca 

on    november      afonso sailed from malacca to the coast of malabar on the old  flor de la mar  carrack that had served to support the conquest of malacca  despite its unsound condition  he used it to transport the treasure amassed in the conquest  given its large capacity  he wanted to give the court of king manuel a show of malaccan treasures  there were also the offers from the kingdom of siam  thailand  to the king of portugal and all his own fortune  on the voyage the  flor de la mar  was wrecked in a storm  and afonso barely escaped drowning 

most muslim and gujarati merchants having fled the city  afonso invested in diplomatic efforts demonstrating generosity to southeast asian merchants  like the chinese  to encourage good relations with the portuguese  trade and diplomatic missions were sent to continental kingdoms  rui nunes da cunha was sent to pegu  burma   from where king binyaram sent back a friendly emissary to kochi in      and sumatra  sumatran kings of kampar and indragiri sending emissaries to afonso accepting the new power  as vassal states of malacca  knowing of siamese ambitions over malacca  afonso sent duarte fernandes in a diplomatic mission to the kingdom of siam  thailand   returning in a chinese junk  he was one of the portuguese who had been arrested in malacca  having gathered knowledge about the culture of the region  there he was the first european to arrive  establishing amicable relations between the kingdom of portugal and the court of the king of siam ramathibodi ii  returning with a siamese envoy bearing gifts and letters to afonso and the king of portugal 

in november  after having secured malacca and learning the location of the then secret  spice islands   afonso sent three ships to find them  led by trusted ant  nio de abreu with deputy commander francisco serr  o  malay sailors were recruited to guide them through java  the lesser sunda islands and the ambon island to banda islands  where they arrived in early       there they remained for a month  buying and filling their ships with nutmeg and cloves  ant  nio de abreu then sailed to amboina whilst serr  o sailed towards the moluccas  but he was shipwrecked near seram  sultan abu lais of ternate heard of their stranding  and  seeing a chance to ally himself with a powerful foreign nation  brought them to ternate in      where they were permitted to build a fort on the island  the forte de s  o jo  o baptista de ternate    built in       

in early       jorge   lvares  sailing on a mission under afonso s orders  was allowed to land in lintin island  on the pearl river delta in southern china  soon after  afonso sent rafael perestrello to southern china  seeking trade relations with the ming dynasty  in ships from portuguese malacca  rafael sailed to canton  guangzhou  in       and again from      to      to trade with chinese merchants  these ventures  along with those of tom   pires and fern  o pires de andrade  were the first direct european diplomatic and commercial ties with china  however  after the death of the chinese zhengde emperor on    april       conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new portuguese embassy  fought sea battles with the portuguese around tuen mun  and tom   was forced to write letters to malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in china until the portuguese relinquished their control of malacca and returned it to the deposed sultan of malacca  who was previously a ming tributary vassal   nonetheless  portuguese relations with china became normalized again by the     s and in      a permanent portuguese base at macau in southern china was established with consent from the ming court 

afonso returned from malacca to cochin  but could not sail to goa as it faced a serious revolt headed by the forces of ismael adil shah  the sultan of bijapur  commanded by rasul khan and his countrymen  during afonso s absence from malacca  portuguese who opposed the taking of goa had waived its possession  even writing to the king that it would be best to let it go  held up by the monsoon and with few forces available  afonso had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew d  garcia de noronha  and jorge de mello pereira 

while at cochin  albuquerque started a school  in a private letter to king manuel i  he states that he had found a chest full of books with which to teach the children of married portuguese settlers   casados   and christian converts to read and write which  according to albuquerque  there were about a hundred in his time   all very sharp and easily learn what they are taught  

on    september       afonso sailed from cochin to goa with fourteen ships carrying       soldiers  determined to recapture the fortress  he ordered trenches dug and a wall breached  but on the day of the planned final assault  rasul khan surrendered  afonso demanded the fort be handed over with its artillery  ammunition and horses  and the deserters to be given up  some had joined rasul khan when the portuguese were forced to flee goa in may       others during the recent siege  rasul khan consented  on condition that their lives be spared  afonso agreed and he left goa  he did spare the lives of the deserters  but had them horribly mutilated  one such renegade was fern  o lopes  bound for portugal in custody  who escaped at the island of saint helena and led a  robinson crusoe  life for many years  after such measures the town became the most prosperous portuguese settlement in india 

in december      an envoy from ethiopia arrived at goa  mateus was sent by the regent queen eleni  following the arrival of the portuguese from socotra in       as an ambassador for the king of portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing muslim influence  he was received in goa with great honour by afonso  as a long sought  prester john  envoy  his arrival was announced by king manuel to pope leo x in       although mateus faced the distrust of afonso s rivals  who tried to prove he was some impostor or muslim spy  afonso sent him to portugal  the king is described as having wept with joy at their report 

in february       while mateus was in portugal  afonso sailed to the red sea with a force of about      portuguese and     malabaris  he was under orders to secure that channel for portugal  socotra had proved ineffective to control the red sea entrance and was abandoned  and afonso s hint that massawa could be a good portuguese base might have been influenced by mateus  reports 

knowing that the mamluks were preparing a second fleet at suez  he wanted to advance before reinforcements arrived in aden  and accordingly laid siege to the city  aden was a fortified city  but although he had scaling ladders they broke during the chaotic attack  after half a day of fierce battle afonso was forced to retreat  he cruised the red sea inside the bab al mandab  with the first european fleet to have sailed this route  he attempted to reach jeddah  but the winds were unfavourable and so he sheltered at kamaran island in may  until sickness among the men and lack of fresh water forced him to retreat  in august       after a second attempt to reach aden  he returned to india with no substantial results  in order to destroy the power of egypt  he wrote to king manuel of the idea of diverting the course of the nile river to render the whole country barren  perhaps most tellingly  he intended to steal the body of the islamic prophet  muhammad  and hold it for ransom until all muslims had left the holy land 

although albuquerque s expedition failed to reach suez  such an incursion into the red sea by a christian fleet for the first time in history stunned the muslim world  and panic spread in cairo 

albuquerque achieved during his term a favourable end to hostilities between the portuguese and the zamorin of calicut  which had lasted ever since the massacre of the portuguese in calicut in       as naval trade faltered and vassals defected  with no foreseeable solutions to the conflict with the portuguese  the court of the zamorin fell to in fighting  the ruling zamorin was assassinated and replaced by a rival  under the instigation of albuquerque  thus  peace talks could commence  the portuguese were allowed to build a fortress in calicut itself  and acquired rights to obtain as much pepper and ginger as they wished  at stipulated prices  and half the customs of calicut as yearly tribute  construction of the fortress began immediately  under the guise of chief architect tom  s fernandes 

with peace concluded  in      afonso devoted himself to governing goa and receiving embassies from indian governors  strengthening the city and encouraging marriages of portuguese men and local women  at that time  portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas  in      under a policy which afonso promulgated  the portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women  to promote settlement  the king of portugal granted freeman status and exemption from crown taxes to portuguese men  known as  casados   or  married men   who ventured overseas and married local women  with afonso s encouragement  mixed marriages flourished  he appointed local people for positions in the portuguese administration and did not interfere with local traditions  except  sati   the practice of immolating widows  which he banned  

in march      king manuel sent to pope leo x a huge and exotic embassy led by trist  o da cunha  who toured the streets of rome in an extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the indies  his reputation reached its peak  laying foundations of the portuguese empire in the east 

in early       afonso sent ambassadors to gujarat s sultan muzaffar shah ii  ruler of cambay  to seek permission to build a fort on diu  india  the mission returned without an agreement  but diplomatic gifts were exchanged  including an indian rhinoceros  afonso sent the gift  named  ganda   and its indian keeper  ocem  to king manuel  in late       manuel sent it as a gift  the famous d  rer s rhinoceros to pope leo x  d  rer never saw the actual rhinoceros  which was the first living example seen in europe since roman times 

in       at cannanore  afonso was visited by a persian ambassador from shah ismail i  who had sent ambassadors to gujarat  ormuz and bijapur  the shah s ambassador to bijapur invited afonso to send back an envoy to persia  miguel ferreira was sent via ormuz to tabriz  where he had several interviews with the shah about common goals on defeating the mamluk sultan 

at the same time  albuquerque decided to conclude the effective conquest of hormuz  he had learned that after the portuguese retreat in       a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful persian vizier  reis hamed  whom the king greatly feared  at ormuz in march       afonso met the king and asked the vizier to be present  he then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage  thus  freeing  the dominated king  so the island in the persian gulf yielded to him without resistance and remained a vassal state of the portuguese empire  ormuz itself would not be persian territory for another century  until a british persian alliance finally expelled the portuguese in       at ormuz  afonso met with miguel ferreira  returning with rich presents and an ambassador  carrying a letter from the persian potentate shah ismael  inviting afonso to become a leading lord in persia  there he remained  engaging in diplomatic efforts  receiving envoys and overseeing the construction of the new fortress  while becoming increasingly ill  his illness was reported as early as september       

in november       he embarked back to goa  a journey he would not live to complete 

afonso s life ended on a bitter note  with a painful and ignominious close  at this time  his political enemies at the portuguese court were planning his downfall  they had lost no opportunity in stirring up the jealousy of king manuel against him  insinuating that afonso intended to usurp power in portuguese india 

while on his return voyage from ormuz in the persian gulf  near the harbor of chaul  he received news of a portuguese fleet arriving from europe  bearing dispatches announcing that he was to be replaced by his personal foe  lopo soares de albergaria  realizing the plot that his enemies had moved against him  profoundly disillusioned  he voiced his bitterness   grave must be my sins before the king  for i am in ill favor with the king for love of the men  and with the men for love of the king   

feeling himself near death  he donned the surcoat of the order of santiago  which he was a knight of  and drew up his will  appointed the captain and senior officials of ormuz  and organized a final council with his captains to decide the main matters affecting the portuguese state of india 

he wrote a brief letter to king manuel  asking him to confer onto his natural son  all of the high honors and rewards  that were justly due to afonso  he wrote in dignified and affectionate terms  assuring manuel of his loyalty  

on    december       afonso de albuquerque died within sight of goa  as his death was known  in the city  grait wailing arose   and many took to the streets to witness his body carried on a chair by his main captains  in a procession lit by torches amidst the crowd 

afonso s body was buried in goa  according to his will  in the church of nossa senhora da serra  our lady of the hill   which he had been built in      to thank the madonna for his escape from kamaran island  that night  even the hindu natives of goa gathered to mourn him alongside the portuguese   for he was much loved by all   and it was said that  god had need of him for war  and for that he had taken him  

in portugal  king manuel s zigzagging policies continued  still trapped by the constraints of real time medieval communication between lisbon and india and unaware that afonso was dead  hearing rumours that the mamluk sultan of egypt was preparing a magnificent army at suez to prevent the conquest of ormuz  he repented of having replaced afonso  and in march      urgently wrote to albergaria to return the command of all operations to afonso and provide him with resources to face the egyptian threat  he organized a new portuguese navy in asia  with orders that afonso  if he was still in india   be made commander in chief against the sultan of cairo s armies  manuel would afterwards learn that afonso had died many months earlier  and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late 

after    years  in       his body was moved to nossa senhora da gra  a church in lisbon  which was ruined and rebuilt after the      great lisbon earthquake 

king manuel i of portugal was belatedly convinced of afonso s loyalty  and endeavoured to atone for his lack of confidence in afonso by heaping honours upon his son  br  s de albuquerque                whom he renamed  afonso  in memory of the father 

afonso de albuquerque was a prolific writer  having sent numerous letters to the king during his governorship  covering topics from minor issues to major strategies  in      his son published a collection of his letters under the title  commentarios do grande affonso d alboquerque   a clear reference to caesar s commentaries  which he reviewed and re published in       there afonso was described as  a man of middle stature  with a long face  fresh complexion  the nose somewhat large  he was a prudent man  and a latin scholar  and spoke in elegant phrases  his conversation and writings showed his excellent education  he was of ready words  very authoritative in his commands  very circumspect in his dealings with the moors  and greatly feared yet greatly loved by all  a quality rarely found united in one captain  he was very valiant and favoured by fortune  

in       afonso s feats were described in  the lusiads   the portuguese main epic poem by lu  s vaz de cam  es  canto x  strophes           the poet praises his achievements  but has the muses frown upon the harsh rule of his men  of whom cam  es was almost a contemporary fellow  in       afonso was celebrated by fernando pessoa in  mensagem   a symbolist epic  in the first part of this work  called  bras  o   coat of arms   he relates portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the portuguese coat of arms  afonso being one of the wings of the griffin headed by henry the navigator  the other wing being king john ii 

a variety of mango that he used to bring on his journeys to india has been named in his honour 

numerous homages have been paid to afonso  he is featured in the padr  o dos descobrimentos monument  there is a square carrying his name in the portuguese capital of lisbon  which also features a bronze statue  two portuguese navy ships have been named in his honour  the sloop nrp  afonso de albuquerque         and the warship nrp  afonso de albuquerque   the latter belonging to a sloop class named albuquerque 

the fabled spice islands were on the imagination of europe since ancient times  in the  nd century ad  the malay peninsula was known by the greek philosopher ptolemy  who labeled it  aurea chersonesus   and who said that it was believed the fabled area held gold in abundance  even indian traders referred to the east pacific region as  land of gold  and made regular visits to malaya in search of the precious metal  tin and sweet scented jungle woods  but neither ptolemy  nor rome  nor alexander was able to see the fabled regions of the east pacific  afonso de albuquerque became the first european to reach the spice islands  upon discovering the malay archipelago  he proceeded in      to conquer malacca  then commissioned an expedition under the command of ant  nio de abreu and vice commander francisco serr  o  the latter being a cousin of magellan  to further explore the extremities of the region in east indonesia  as a result of these voyages of exploration  the portuguese became the first europeans to discover and to reach the fabled spice islands in the indies in addition to discovering their sea routes  afonso found what had evaded columbus  grasp      the wealth of the orient  his discoveries did not go unnoticed  and it took little time for magellan to arrive in the same region a few years later and discover the philippines for spain  giving birth to the papal treaty of zaragoza 

afonso s operations sent a voyage pushing further south which made the european discovery of timor in the far south of oceania  and the discovery of papua new guinea in       this was followed up by another portuguese  jorge de menezes in       who named papua new guinea  the  island of the papua  
through afonso s diplomatic activities  portugal opened the sea between europe and china  as early as       jorge de albuquerque  a portuguese commanding officer in malacca  sent his subordinate jorge   lvares to sail to china on a ship loaded with pepper from sumatra  after sailing across the sea  jorge   lvares and his crew dropped anchor in tamao  an island located at the mouth of the pearl river  this was the first portuguese to set foot in the territory known as china  the mythical  middle kingdom  where they erected a stone padr  o    lvares is the first european to reach chinese land by sea  and  the first european to enter hong kong  in      afonso de albuquerque  the viceroy of the estado da india dispatched rafael perestrello to sail to china in order to pioneer european trade relations with the chinese nation  rafael perestrelo was quoted as saying   being a very good and honest people  the chinese hope to make friends with the portuguese   in spite of initial harmony and excitement between the two empires  difficulties soon arose  portugal s efforts in establishing lasting ties with china did pay off in the long run  the portuguese colonized macau  and established the first european permanent settlement on chinese soil  which served as a permanent colonial base in southern china  and the two empires maintained an exchange in culture and trade for nearly     years  the longest empire in history                begun by afonso de albuquerque five centuries earlier  ended when portugal ceded the government of macau to china 

afonso de albuquerque pioneered trade relations with thailand  and was as such the first recorded european to contact thailand

alcaeus of mytilene       alkaios ho mutil  naios        th century bc  was a lyric poet from the greek island of lesbos who is credited with inventing the alcaic stanza  he was included in the canonical list of nine lyric poets by the scholars of hellenistic alexandria  he was an older contemporary and an alleged lover of sappho  with whom he may have exchanged poems  he was born into the aristocratic governing class of mytilene  the main city of lesbos  where he was involved in political disputes and feuds 

the broad outlines of the poet s life are well known  he was born into the aristocratic  warrior class that dominated mytilene  the strongest city state on the island of lesbos and  by the end of the seventh century bc  the most influential of all the north aegean greek cities  with a strong navy and colonies securing its trade routes in the hellespont  the city had long been ruled by kings born to the penthilid clan but  during the poet s life  the penthilids were a spent force and rival aristocrats and their factions contended with each other for supreme power  alcaeus and his older brothers were passionately involved in the struggle but experienced little success  their political adventures can be understood in terms of three tyrants who came and went in succession 

sometime before      bc  mytilene fought athens for control of sigeion and alcaeus was old enough to participate in the fighting  according to the historian herodotus  the poet threw away his shield to make good his escape from the victorious athenians then celebrated the occasion in a poem that he later sent to his friend  melanippus  it is thought that alcaeus travelled widely during his years in exile  including at least one visit to egypt  his older brother  antimenidas  appears to have served as a mercenary in the army of nebuchadnezzar ii and probably took part in the conquest of askelon  alcaeus wrote verses in celebration of antimenides  return  including mention of his valour in slaying the larger opponent  frag        and he proudly describes the military hardware that adorned their family home  frag       

alcaeus was a contemporary and a countryman of sappho and  since both poets composed for the entertainment of mytilenean friends  they had many opportunities to associate with each other on a quite regular basis  such as at the  kallisteia   an annual festival celebrating the island s federation under mytilene  held at the  messon   referred to as  temenos  in frs      and       where sappho performed publicly with female choirs  alcaeus  reference to sappho in terms more typical of a divinity  as  holy pure  honey smiling sappho   fr        may owe its inspiration to her performances at the festival  the lesbian or aeolic school of poetry  reached in the songs of sappho and alcaeus that high point of brilliancy to which it never after wards approached  and it was assumed by later greek critics and during the early centuries of the christian era that the two poets were in fact lovers  a theme which became a favourite subject in art  as in the urn pictured above  

the poetic works of alcaeus were collected into ten books  with elaborate commentaries  by the alexandrian scholars aristophanes of byzantium and aristarchus of samothrace sometime in the  rd century bc  and yet his verses today exist only in fragmentary form  varying in size from mere phrases  such as  wine  window into a man   fr       to entire groups of verses and stanzas  such as those quoted below  fr        alexandrian scholars numbered him in their canonic nine  one lyric poet per muse   among these  pindar was held by many ancient critics to be pre eminent  but some gave precedence to alcaeus instead  the canonic nine are traditionally divided into two groups  with alcaeus  sappho and anacreon  being  monodists  or  solo singers   with the following characteristics 
the other six of the canonic nine composed verses for public occasions  performed by choruses and professional singers and typically featuring complex metrical arrangements that were never reproduced in other verses  however  this division into two groups is considered by some modern scholars to be too simplistic and often it is practically impossible to know whether a lyric composition was sung or recited  or whether or not it was accompanied by musical instruments and dance  even the private reflections of alcaeus  ostensibly sung at dinner parties  still retain a public function 

critics often seek to understand alcaeus in comparison with sappho 

the roman poet  horace  also compared the two  describing alcaeus as  more full throatedly singing      see horace s tribute below  alcaeus himself seems to underscore the difference between his own  down to earth  style and sappho s more  celestial  qualities when he describes her almost as a goddess  as cited above   and yet it has been argued that both poets were concerned with a balance between the divine and the profane  each emphasising different elements in that balance 

dionysius of halicarnassus exhorts us to  observe in alcaeus the sublimity  brevity and sweetness coupled with stern power  his splendid figures  and his clearness which was unimpaired by the dialect  and above all mark his manner of expressing his sentiments on public affairs   while quintilian  after commending alcaeus for his excellence  in that part of his works where he inveighs against tyrants and contributes to good morals  in his language he is concise  exalted  careful and often like an orator   goes on to add   but he descended into wantonness and amours  though better fitted for higher things  

the works of alcaeus are conventionally grouped according to five genres 

the following verses demonstrate some key characteristics of the alcaic style  square brackets indicate uncertainties in the ancient text  
the greek meter here is relatively simple  comprising the greater asclepiad  adroitly used to convey  for example  the rhythm of jostling cups     the language of the poem is typically direct and concise and comprises short sentences     the first line is in fact a model of condensed meaning  comprising an exhortation   let s drink    a rhetorical question   why are we waiting for the lamps    and a justifying statement  only an inch of daylight left   the meaning is clear and uncomplicated  the subject is drawn from personal experience  and there is an absence of poetic ornament  such as simile or metaphor  like many of his poems  e g   frs                           it begins with a verb  in this case  let s drink    and it includes a proverbial expression   only an inch of daylight left   though it is possible that he coined it himself 

alcaeus rarely used metaphor or simile and yet he had a fondness for the allegory of the storm tossed ship of state  the following fragment of a hymn to castor and polydeuces  the dioscuri  is possibly another example of this though some scholars interpret it instead as a prayer for a safe voyage 

hither now to me from your isle of pelops 
you powerful children of zeus and leda 
showing youselves kindly by nature  castor
and polydeuces 

travelling abroad on swift footed horses 
over the wide earth  over all the ocean 
how easily you bring deliverance from
death s gelid rigor 

landing on tall ships with a sudden  great bound 
a far away light up the forestays running 
bringing radiance to a ship in trouble 
sailed in the darkness 


the poem was written in sapphic stanzas  a verse form popularly associated with his compatriot  sappho  but in which he too excelled  here paraphrased in english to suggest the same rhythms  there were probably another three stanzas in the original poem but only nine letters of them remain  the  far away light     is a reference to st elmo s fire  an electrical discharge supposed by ancient greek mariners to be an epiphany of the dioscuri  but the meaning of the line was obscured by gaps in the papyrus until reconstructed by a modern scholar   such reconstructions are typical of the extant poetry  see scholars  fragments and sources below   this poem doesn t begin with a verb but with an adverb              but still communicates a sense of action  he probably performed his verses at drinking parties for friends and political allies   men for whom loyalty was essential  particularly in such troubled times 

the roman poet horace modelled his own lyrical compositions on those of alcaeus  rendering the lesbian poet s verse forms  including  alcaic  and  sapphic  stanzas  into concise latin     an achievement he celebrates in his third book of odes  in his second book  in an ode composed in alcaic stanzas on the subject of an almost fatal accident he had on his farm  he imagines meeting alcaeus and sappho in hades 
ovid compared alcaeus to sappho in letters of the heroines  where sappho is imagined to speak as follows 

the story of alcaeus is partly the story of the scholars who rescued his work from oblivion  his verses have not come down to us through a manuscript tradition     generations of scribes copying an author s collected works  such as delivered intact into the modern age four entire books of pindar s odes     but haphazardly  in quotes from ancient scholars and commentators whose own works have chanced to survive  and in the tattered remnants of papyri uncovered from an ancient rubbish pile at oxyrhynchus and other locations in egypt  sources that modern scholars have studied and correlated exhaustively  adding little by little to the world s store of poetic fragments 

ancient scholars quoted alcaeus in support of various arguments  thus for example heraclitus  the allegorist  quoted fr      and part of fr     about ships in a storm  in his study on homer s use of allegory  the hymn to hermes  fr    b   was quoted by hephaestion  grammarian  and both he and libanius  the rhetorician  quoted the first two lines of fr       celebrating the return from babylon of alcaeus  brother  the rest of fr      was paraphrased in prose by the historian geographer strabo  many fragments were supplied in quotes by athenaeus  principally on the subject of wine drinking  but fr        wine  window into a man   was quoted much later by the byzantine grammarian  john tzetzes 

the first  modern  publication of alcaeus  verses appeared in a greek and latin edition of fragments collected from the canonic nine lyrical poets by michael neander  published at basle in       this was followed by another edition of the nine poets  collected by henricus stephanus and published in paris in       fulvius ursinus compiled a fuller collection of alcaic fragments  including a commentary  which was published at antwerp in       the first separate edition of alcaeus was by christian david jani and it was published at halle in       the next separate edition was by august matthiae  leipzig      

some of the fragments quoted by ancient scholars were able to be integrated by scholars in the nineteenth century  thus for example two separate quotes by athenaeus were united by theodor bergk to form fr       three separate sources were combined to form fr       as mentioned above  including a prose paraphrase from strabo that first needed to be restored to its original meter  a synthesis achieved by the united efforts of otto hoffmann  karl otfried muller and franz heinrich ludolf ahrens  the discovery of the oxyrhynchus papyri towards the end of the nineteenth century dramatically increased the scope of scholarly research  in fact  eight important fragments have now been compiled from papyri     frs       a                       and most recently s     these fragments typically feature lacunae or gaps that scholars fill with  educated guesses   including for example a  brilliant supplement  by maurice bowra in fr      a hymn to the dioscuri that includes a description of st elmo s fire in the ship s rigging  working with only eight letters    tr   pr     tr   ntes    bowra conjured up a phrase that brilliantly develops the meaning and the euphony of the poem    tr   pr  ton  ontr  chontes    describing luminescence  running along the forestays  






alcamenes

alcamenes    was an ancient greek sculptor of lemnos and athens  who flourished in the  nd half of the  th century bc  he was a younger contemporary of phidias and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works  among which a hephaestus and an aphrodite  of the gardens  were conspicuous 

pausanias says that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of zeus at olympia  but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility  pausanias also refers to a statue of ares by alcamenes that was erected on the athenian agora  which some have related to the ares borghese  however  the temple of ares to which he refers had only been moved from acharnes and re sited in the agora in augustus s time  and statues known to derive from alcamenes  statue show the god in a breastplate  so the identification of alcamenes  ares with the ares borghese is not secure 

at pergamum there was discovered in      a hellenistic copy of the head of the hermes  propylaeus  of alcamenes  as  however  the deity is represented in a neo attic  archaistic and conventional character  this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of alcamenes  who was almost certainly a progressive and original artist 

it is safer to judge him by the sculptural decoration of the parthenon  in which he must almost certainly have taken a share under the direction of phidias  he is said to be the most eminent sculptor in athens after the departure of phidias for olympia  but enigmatic in that none of the sculptures associated with his name in classical literature can be securely connected with existing copies 






alcmene

in greek mythology  alcmene    or alcmena    ancient greek                  or doric                   latin  alcumena means  strong in wrath   was the wife of amphitryon by whom she bore two children  iphicles and laonome  she is  however  better known as the mother of heracles whose father was the god zeus  alcmene was also called electryone                            a patronymic name as a daughter of electryon 

according to the  bibliotheca   alcmene was born to electryon  the son of perseus and andromeda  and king of tiryns and mycenae or medea in argolis  her mother was anaxo  daughter of alcaeus and astydamia  other accounts say her mother was lysidice  the daughter of pelops and hippodameia  or eurydice the daughter of pelops  according to pausanias  the poet asius made alcmene the daughter of amphiaraus and eriphyle 

hesiod describes alcmene as the tallest  most beautiful woman with wisdom surpassed by no person born of mortal parents  it is said that her face and dark eyes were as charming as aphrodite s  and that she honoured her husband like no woman before her 

according to the  bibliotheca   alcmene went with amphitryon to thebes  where he was purified by creon for accidentally killing electryon  alcmene refused to marry amphitryon until he had avenged the death of her brothers  during amphitryon s expedition against the taphians and teleboans  zeus visited alcmene disguised as amphitryon  extending one night into three  zeus slept with alcmene  his great granddaughter  thereby conceiving heracles  while recounting amphitryon s victories against the teleboans  when amphitryon finally returned to thebes  alcmene told him that he had come the night before and slept with her  he learned from tiresias what zeus had done 

in homer s  iliad   when alcmene was about to give birth to heracles  zeus announced to all the gods that on that day a child by zeus himself  would be born and rule all those around him  hera  after requesting zeus to swear an oath to that effect  descended from olympus to argos and made the wife of sthenelus  son of perseus  give birth to eurystheus after only seven months  while at the same time preventing alcmene from delivering heracles  this resulted in the fulfilment of zeus s oath in that it was eurystheus rather than heracles 

according to ovid s  metamorphoses   while in labour  alcmene was having great difficulty giving birth to such a large child  after seven days and nights of agony  alcmene stretched out her arms and called upon lucina  the goddess of childbirth  the roman equivalent of eileithyia   while lucina did go to alcmene  she had been previously instructed by juno  hera  to prevent the delivery  with her hands clasped and legs crossed  lucina muttered charms  thereby preventing alcmene from giving birth  alcmene writhed in pain  cursed the heavens  and came close to death  galanthis  a maid of alcmene who was nearby  observed lucina s behaviour and quickly deduced that it was juno s doing  to put an end to her mistress s suffering  she announced that alcmene had safely delivered her child  which surprised lucina so much that she immediately jumped up and unclenched her hands  as soon as lucina leapt up  alcmene was released from her spell  and gave birth to heracles  as punishment for deceiving lucina  galanthis was transformed into a weasel  she continued to live with alcmene 

in pausanias  recounting  hera sent witches  as they were called by the thebans  to hinder alcmene s delivery of heracles  the witches were successful in preventing the birth until historis  daughter of tiresias  thought of a trick to deceive the witches  like galanthis  historis announced that alcmene had delivered her child  having been deceived  the witches went away  allowing alcmene to give birth 

in contrast to the depictions of a difficult labor above  an alternative version is presented in  amphitryon   a comedic play by plautus  here alcmene calls upon jupiter  who performs a miracle allowing her to give birth quickly and without pain  after a crash of thunder and light  the baby arrives without anyone s assistance 

after the death of amphitryon  alcmene married rhadamanthys  son of zeus  and lived with him in exile at ocaleae in boeotia  it is said that after heracles was apotheosised  hyllus  having pursued and killed eurystheus  cut off eurystheus  head and gave it to alcmene  who gouged out the eyes with weaving pins  in metamorphoses  an aging alcmene recounted the story of the birth of heracles to iole 

there are two accounts of alcmene s death  in the first  according to the megarians  alcmene was walking from argos to thebes when she died at megara  the heracleidae fell into disagreement about where to take alcmene s body  with some wishing to take her corpse back to argos  and others wishing to take it to thebes to be buried with amphitryon and heracles  children by megara  however  the god in delphi gave the heracleidae an oracle that it was better to bury alcmene in megara  in the second account given by the thebans  when alcmene died  she was turned from human form to a stone 

pausanias indicated that an altar to alcmene had been built in the cynosarges in athens  alongside altars to heracles  hebe  and iolaus  pausanias also said that alcmene s tomb is located near the olympieum at megara 





alcidamas

alcidamas     of elaea  in aeolis  greek sophist and rhetorician  flourished in the  th century bc 

he was the pupil and successor of gorgias and taught at athens at the same time as isocrates  to whom he was a rival and opponent  we possess two declamations under his name   on sophists                                 directed against isocrates and setting forth the superiority of extempore over written speeches  a more recently discovered fragment of another speech against isocrates is probably of later date    odysseus   perhaps spurious  in which odysseus accuses palamedes of treachery during the siege of troy 

according to alcidamas  the highest aim of the orator was the power of speaking  extempore  on every conceivable subject  aristotle   rhet   iii     criticizes his writings as characterized by pomposity of style and an extravagant use of poetical epithets and compounds and far fetched metaphors 

of other works only fragments and the titles have survived   messeniakos   advocating the freedom of the messenians and containing the sentiment that  god has left all men free  nature has made no man a slave   a  eulogy of death   in consideration of the wide extent of human sufferings  a  techne  or instruction book in the art
of rhetoric  and a  phusikos logos   lastly  his  mouseion   a word invoking the muses  seems to have contained the narrative of the  contest of homer and hesiod   of which the version that has survived is the work of a grammarian in the time of hadrian  based on alcidamas  this hypothesis of the contents of the  mouseion   originally suggested by nietzsche   rheinisches museum                          appears to have been confirmed by three papyrus findsone  rd century bc   flinders petrie papyri   ed  mahaffy        pl  xxv    one  nd century bc  basil mandilaras   a new papyrus fragment of the  certamen homeri et hesiodi    platon                     and one  nd or  rd century ad  university of michigan pap        winter  j  g    a new fragment on the life of homer   tapa                        






aldine press

aldine press was the printing office started by aldus manutius in      in venice  from which were issued the celebrated aldine editions of the classics  latin and greek masterpieces plus a few more modern works   the first book that was dated and printed under his name appeared in      

the aldine press is famous in the history of typography  among other things  for the introduction of italics  the press was the first to issue printed books in the small octavo size  similar to that of a modern paperback  and like that intended for portability and ease of reading  according to curt buhler  the press issued     books during twenty years of activity under aldus  after aldus    death in      the press was continued by his wife  maria and her father  andrea torresani  until his son  paulus manutius               took over  his grandson aldus manutius the younger then ran the firm until his death in       today  the antique books printed by the aldine press in venice are referred to as  aldines  

the press enjoyed a monopoly of works printed in greek in the republic of venice  effectively giving it copyright protection  protection outside the republic was more problematic  however  the firm maintained an agency in paris  but its commercial success was affected by many counterfeit editions  produced in lyons and elsewhere 

aldus manutius  the founder of the aldine press  was originally a humanist scholar and teacher  manutius met andrea torresani  who had acquired publishing equipment from nicholas jensen s widow  the aldine press was originally owned half by pier francesco barbarigo  the nephew of the current doge of the time  agostino barbarigo  and the other half by andrea torresani  manutius owned one fifth of torresani s share  manutius mainly was in charge of the scholarship and editing  leaving financial and operating concerns to barbarigo and torresani  in       aldus established his own location in a building called the  thermae  in the sestiere di san polo  the building was later demolished in       manutius lived and worked in the  thermae  to produce published books from the aldine press  this was also the location of the  new academy   where a group of manutius  friends  associates  and editors came together to translate greek and latin texts 

the press was started by manutius based on his love of classics and the need of preservation of hellenic studies  at first the press printed new copies of plato  aristotle  and other greek and latin classics  manutius also printed dictionaries and grammars to help people interpret the books  used by scholars wanting to learn greek to employ learned greeks to teach them directly  historian elizabeth eisenstein claimed that the fall of constantinople in      had threatened the importance and survival of greek scholarship  but publications such as those by the aldine press secured it  erasmus was one of the scholars learned in greek with whom the aldine press partnered in order to provide accurately translated text  the aldine press also expanded into current languages  mainly italian and french 
aldus manutius hired francesco griffo to create a typeface designed to reproduce the written hand of the humanists  this resulted in the first roman face adapted and known today as italic type  it was first used to print cardinal pietro bembo s  de aetna  in       before this time print publishing used block letters  the look of handwriting as print was a new phenomenon and  try as he might to prevent it  manutius  typeface was illegally copied  spreading through europe 

in      manutius produced plain texts in useful form  using the term  enchiridion   meaning a manual or small  hand held weapon  the octavo was the first appearance of the editio minor  a straightforward text  established as well as the editor can manage  although these new  portable books were not cheap  the books of the aldine press did not force upon their buyers a substantial investment that large volumes of text and commentary demanded during this era  the editio minor  instead  brought financial and logistical benefits to those interested in the classics  an individual didn t have to go to the book  rather now the book came along with them 

in       aldus used as his publisher s device the image of a dolphin wrapped around an anchor   the dolphin and anchor device owed its origins most immediately to pietro bembo  aldus was to tell erasmus six years later that bembo had given him a silver coin minted under the emperor vesparian and bearing an image of this device  the image of the dolphin and anchor on the coin came with a saying   festina lente   meaning  make haste slowly   this would become the motto for the aldine press 

aldus manutius the elder died on february          after his death the firm was run by andrea torresani and his daughter  maria  the widow of aldus manutius  the aldine press was named in      as  in the house of aldus and andrea torresano  which kept this name until       in       paulus manutius managed the firm  starting it up again and changing its name to  heirs of aldus and andrea torresano   in      the imprint changed to  sons of aldo manuzio   in      aldus manutius the younger continued the business until his death 

a partial list of publications from the aldine press cited from  aldus manutius  a legacy more lasting than bronze  

works published from the greeks  manutius printed thirty editiones principes of greek texts  allowing these texts to escape the fragility of the manuscript tradition

ealdred  archbishop of york 

ealdred  or aldred  died    september       was abbot of tavistock  bishop of worcester  and archbishop of york in anglo saxon england  he was related to a number of other ecclesiastics of the period  after becoming a monk at the monastery at winchester  he was appointed abbot of tavistock abbey in around       in      he was named to the bishopric of worcester  ealdred  besides his episcopal duties  served edward the confessor  the king of england  as a diplomat and as a military leader  he worked to bring one of the king s relatives  edward the exile  back to england from hungary to secure an heir for the childless king 

in      he undertook a pilgrimage to jerusalem  the first bishop from england to do so  as administrator of the diocese of hereford  he was involved in fighting against the welsh  suffering two defeats at the hands of raiders before securing a settlement with gruffydd ap llywelyn  a welsh ruler 

in       ealdred was elected to the archbishopric of york  but had difficulty in obtaining papal approval for his appointment  only managing to do so when he promised not to hold the bishoprics of york and worcester simultaneously  he helped secure the election of wulfstan as his successor at worcester  during his archiepiscopate  he built and embellished churches in his diocese  and worked to improve his clergy by holding a synod which published regulations for the priesthood 

some sources state that following king edward the confessor s death in       it was ealdred who crowned harold godwinson as king of england  ealdred supported harold as king  but when harold was defeated at the battle of hastings  ealdred backed edgar the   theling and then endorsed king william the conqueror  the duke of normandy and a distant relative of king edward s  ealdred crowned king william on christmas day in       william never quite trusted ealdred or the other english leaders  and ealdred had to accompany william back to normandy in       but he had returned to york by the time of his death in       ealdred supported the churches and monasteries in his diocese with gifts and building projects 

ealdred was probably born in the west of england  and could be related to lyfing  his predecessor as bishop of worcester  his family  from devonshire  may have been well to do  another relative was wilstan or wulfstan  who under ealdred s influence became abbot of gloucester  ealdred was a monk in the cathedral chapter at winchester cathedral before becoming abbot of tavistock abbey about       an office he held until about       even after leaving the abbacy of tavistock  he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death  no contemporary documents relating to ealdred s time as abbot have been discovered 

ealdred was made bishop of worcester in       a position he held until his resignation in       he may have acted as suffragan  or subordinate bishop  to his predecessor lyfing before formally assuming the bishopric  as from about      ealdred witnessed as an  episcopus   or bishop  and a charter from      or early      names sihtric as abbot of tavistock  lyfing died on    march       and ealdred became bishop of worcester shortly after  however  ealdred did not receive the other two dioceses that lyfing had held  crediton and cornwall  king edward the confessor  reigned              granted these to leofric  who combined the two sees at crediton in      

ealdred was an advisor to king edward the confessor  and was often involved in the royal government  he was also a military leader  and in      he led an unsuccessful expedition against the welsh  this was in retaliation for a raid led by the welsh rulers gruffydd ap rhydderch  rhys ap rhydderch  and gruffydd ap llywelyn  ealdred s expedition was betrayed by some welsh soldiers who were serving with the english  and ealdred was defeated 

in       ealdred went to rome  on the king s errand   apparently to secure papal approval to move the seat  or centre  of the bishopric of crediton to exeter  it may also have been to secure the release of the king from a vow to go on pilgrimage  if sources from after the norman conquest of england are to be believed  while in rome  he attended a papal council  along with his fellow english bishop herman  that same year  as ealdred was returning to england he met sweyn  a son of godwin  earl of wessex  and probably absolved sweyn for having abducted the abbess of leominster abbey in       through ealdred s intercession  sweyn was restored to his earldom  which he had lost after abducting the abbess and murdering his cousin beorn estrithson  ealdred helped sweyn not only because ealdred was a supporter of earl godwin s family but because sweyn s earldom was close to his bishopric  as recently as      irish raiders had allied with gruffydd ap rhydderch of gwent in raiding along the river usk  ealdred unsuccessfully tried to drive off the raiders  but was again routed by the welsh  this failure underscored ealdred s need for a strong earl in the area to protect against raids  normally  the bishop of hereford would have led the defence in the absence of an earl of hereford  but in      the incumbent    thelstan  was blind  so ealdred took on the role of defender 

earl godwin s rebellion against the king in      came as a blow to ealdred  who was a supporter of the earl and his family  ealdred was present at the royal council at london that banished godwin s family  later in       when he was sent to intercept harold godwinson and his brothers as they fled england after their father s outlawing  ealdred  could not  or would not  capture the brothers  the banishment of ealdred s patron came shortly after the death of   lfric puttoc  the archbishop of york  york and worcester had long had close ties  and the two sees had often been held in plurality  or at the same time  ealdred probably wanted to become archbishop of york after   lfric s death  but his patron s eclipse led to the king appointing cynesige  a royal chaplain  instead  in september       though  godwin returned from exile and his family was restored to power  by late      ealdred was once more in royal favour  at some point  he was alleged to have accompanied swein on a pilgrimage to the holy land  but proof is lacking 

in      king edward sent ealdred to germany to obtain emperor henry iii s help in returning edward the exile  son of edmund ironside  to england  edmund  reigned       was an elder half brother of king edward the confessor  and edmund s son edward was in hungary with king andrew i  having left england as an infant after his father s death and the accession of cnut as king of england  in this mission ealdred was somewhat successful and obtained insight into the working of the german church during a stay of a year with hermann ii  the archbishop of cologne  he also was impressed with the buildings he saw  and later incorporated some of the german styles into his own constructions  the main objective of the mission  however  was to secure the return of edward  but this failed  mainly because henry iii s relations with the hungarians were strained  and the emperor was unable or unwilling to help ealdred  ealdred was able to discover that edward was alive  and had a place at the hungarian court  although some sources state that ealdred attended the coronation of emperor henry iv  this is not possible  as on the date that henry was crowned  ealdred was in england consecrating an abbot 

ealdred had returned to england by       and brought with him a copy of the  pontificale romano germanicum   a set of liturgies  with him  an extant copy of this work  currently manuscript cotton vitellus e xii  has been identified as a copy owned by ealdred  it appears likely that the  rule of chrodegang   a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of secular canons  was introduced into england by ealdred sometime before       probably he brought it back from germany  possibly in concert with harold 

after ealdred s return to england he took charge of the sees of hereford and ramsbury  ealdred also administered winchcombe abbey and gloucester abbey  the authors of the  handbook of british chronology third edition  say he was named bishop of hereford in       holding the see until he resigned it in       but other sources say that he merely administered the see while it was vacant  or that he was bishop of hereford from      to      

ealdred became involved with the see of ramsbury after its bishop herman got into a dispute with king edward over the movement of the seat of his bishopric to malmesbury abbey  herman wished to move the seat of his see  but edward refused permission for the move  ealdred was a close associate of herman s  and the historian h  r  loyn called herman  something of an alter ego  to ealdred  according to the medieval chronicler john of worcester  ealdred was given the see of ramsbury to administer while herman remained outside england  herman returned in       and resumed his bishopric  there is no contemporary documentary evidence of ealdred s administration of ramsbury 

the king again employed ealdred as a diplomat in       when he assisted earls harold and leofric in negotiations with the welsh  edward sent ealdred after the death in battle of bishop leofgar of hereford  who had attacked gruffydd ap llywelyn after encouragement from the king  however  leofgar lost the battle and his life  and edward had to sue for peace  although details of the negotiations are lacking  gruffydd ap llywelyn swore loyalty to king edward  but the oath may not have had any obligations on gruffydd s part to edward  the exact terms of the submission are not known in total  but gruffydd was not required to assist edward in war nor attend edward s court  ealdred was rewarded with the administration of the see of hereford  which he held until       and was appointed archbishop of york  the diocese had suffered a serious raid from the welsh in       and during his administration  ealdred continued the rebuilding of the cathedral church as well as securing the cathedral chapter s rights  ealdred was granted the administration in order that the area might have someone with experience with the welsh in charge 

in      ealdred made a pilgrimage to jerusalem  the first english bishop to make the journey  he travelled through hungary  and the  anglo saxon chronicle  stated that  he went to jerusalem in such state as no one had done before him   while in jerusalem he made a gift of a gold chalice to the church of the holy sepulchre  it is possible that the reason ealdred travelled through hungary was to arrange the travel of edward the exile s family to england  another possibility is that he wished to search for other possible heirs to king edward in hungary  it is not known exactly when edward the exile s family returned to england  whether they returned with edward in       or sometime later  so it is only a possibility that they returned with ealdred in      

very little documentary evidence is available from ealdred s time as bishop of worcester  only five leases that he signed survive  and all date from      to       two further leases exist in  hemming s cartulary  as copies only  how the diocese of worcester was administered when ealdred was abroad is unclear  although it appears that wulfstan  the prior of the cathedral chapter  performed the religious duties in the diocese  on the financial side  the  evesham chronicle  states that   thelwig  who became abbot of evesham abbey in       administered worcester before he became abbot 

cynesige  the archbishop of york  died on    december       and ealdred was elected archbishop of york on christmas day        although a bishop was promptly appointed to hereford  none was named to worcester  and it appears that ealdred intended to retain worcester along with york  which several of his predecessors had done  there were a few reasons for this  one of which was political  as the kings of england preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics  hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism  another reason was that york was not a wealthy see  and worcester was  holding worcester along with york allowed the archbishop sufficient revenue to support himself 

in      ealdred travelled to rome to receive the pallium  the symbol of an archbishop s authority  journeying with him was tostig  another son of earl godwin  who was now earl of northumbria  william of malmesbury says that ealdred  by  amusing the simplicity of king edward and alleging the custom of his predecessors  had acquired  more by bribery than by reason  the archbishopric of york while still holding his former see   on his arrival in rome  however  charges of simony  or the buying of ecclesiastical office  and lack of learning were brought against him  and his elevation to york was refused by pope nicholas ii  who also deposed him from worcester  the story of ealdred being deposed comes from the  vita edwardi   a life of edward the confessor  but the  vita wulfstani   an account of the life of ealdred s successor at worcester  wulfstan  says that nicholas refused the pallium until a promise to find a replacement for worcester was given by ealdred  yet another chronicler  john of worcester  mentions nothing of any trouble in rome  and when discussing the appointment of wulfstan  says that wulfstan was elected freely and unanimously by the clergy and people  john of worcester also claims that at wulfstan s consecration  stigand  the archbishop of canterbury extracted a promise from ealdred that neither he nor his successors would lay claim to any jurisdiction over the diocese of worcester  given that john of worcester wrote his chronicle after the eruption of the canterbury   york supremacy struggle  the story of ealdred renouncing any claims to worcester needs to be considered suspect 

for whatever reason  ealdred gave up the see of worcester in       when papal legates arrived in england to hold a council and make sure that ealdred relinquished worcester  this happened at easter in       ealdred was succeeded by wulfstan  chosen by ealdred  but john of worcester relates that ealdred had a hard time deciding between wulfstan and   thelwig  the legates had urged the selection of wulfstan because of his saintliness  because the position of stigand  the archbishop of canterbury  was irregular  wulfstan sought and received consecration as a bishop from ealdred  normally  wulfstan would have gone to the archbishop of canterbury  as the see of worcester was within canterbury s province  although ealdred gave up the bishopric  the appointment of wulfstan was one that allowed ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the see of worcester  ealdred retained a number of estates belonging to worcester  even after the norman conquest  ealdred still controlled some events in worcester  and it was ealdred  not wulfstan  who opposed urse d abetot s attempt to extend the castle of worcester into the cathedral after the norman conquest 

while archbishop  ealdred built at beverley  expanding on the building projects begun by his predecessor cynesige  as well as repairing and expanding other churches in his diocese  he also built refectories for the canons at york and southwell  he also was the one bishop that published ecclesiastical legislation during edward the confessor s reign  attempting to discipline and reform the clergy  he held a synod of his clergy shortly before      

john of worcester  a medieval chronicler  stated that ealdred crowned king harold ii in       although the norman chroniclers mention stigand as the officiating prelate  given ealdred s known support of godwin s family  john of worcester is probably correct  stigand s position as archbishop was canonically suspect  and as earl harold had not allowed stigand to consecrate one of the earl s churches  it is unlikely that harold would have allowed stigand to perform the much more important royal coronation  arguments for stigand having performed the coronation  however  rely on the fact that no other english source names the ecclesiastic who performed the ceremony  all norman sources name stigand as the presider  in all events  ealdred and harold were close  and ealdred supported harold s bid to become king  ealdred perhaps accompanied harold when the new king went to york and secured the support of the northern magnates shortly after harold s consecration 

according to the medieval chronicler geoffrey gaimar  after the battle of stamford bridge harold entrusted the loot gained from harold hardrada to ealdred  gaimar asserts that king harold did this because he had heard of duke william s landing in england  and needed to rush south to counter it  after the battle of hastings  ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate edgar the   theling  edward the exile s son  as king  but eventually he submitted to william the conqueror at berkhamsted  john of worcester says that the group supporting edgar vacillated over what to do while william ravaged the countryside  which led to ealdred and edgar s submission to william 

ealdred crowned william king on christmas day       an innovation in william s coronation ceremony was that before the actual crowning  ealdred asked the assembled crowd  in english  if it was their wish that william be crowned king  the bishop of coutances then did the same  but in norman french  in march       william took ealdred with him when william returned to normandy  along with the other english leaders earl edwin of mercia  earl morcar  edgar the   theling  and archbishop stigand  ealdred at whitsun      performed the coronation of matilda  william s wife  the  laudes regiae   or song commending a ruler  that was performed at matilda s coronation may have been composed by ealdred himself for the occasion  in       when the northern thegns rebelled against william and attempted to install edgar the   theling as king  ealdred continued to support william  he was the only northern leader to support william  however  ealdred was back at york by       he died there on    september       and was buried in his episcopal cathedral  he may have taken an active part in trying to calm the rebellions in the north in      and       the medieval chronicler william of malmesbury records a story that when the new sheriff of worcester  urse d abetot  encroached on the cemetery of the cathedral chapter for worcester cathedral  ealdred pronounced a rhyming curse on him  saying  thou are called urse  may you have god s curse  

after ealdred s death  one of the restraints on william s treatment of the english was removed  ealdred was one of a few native englishmen who william appears to have trusted  and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate englishmen into the administration  although such efforts did not entirely stop  in       a church council was held at westminster and a number of bishops were deposed  by      there were only two englishmen in episcopal sees  and by the time of william s death in       there was only one  wulfstan ii of worcester 

ealdred did much to restore discipline in the monasteries and churches under his authority  and was liberal with gifts to the churches of his diocese  he built the monastic church of st peter at gloucester  now gloucester cathedral  though nothing of his fabric remains   then part of his diocese of worcester  he also repaired a large part of beverley minster in the diocese of york  adding a presbytery and an unusually splendid painted ceiling covering  all the upper part of the church from the choir to the tower   intermingled with gold in various ways  and in a wonderful fashion   he added a pulpit  in german style  of bronze  gold and silver  surmounted by an arch with a rood cross in the same materials  these were examples of the lavish decorations added to important churches in the years before the conquest 

ealdred encouraged folcard  a monk of canterbury  to write the  life  of saint john of beverley  this was part of ealdred s promotion of the cult of saint john  who had only been canonised in       along with the  pontificale   ealdred may have brought back from cologne the first manuscript of the  cambridge songs  to enter england  a collection of latin goliardic songs which became famous in the middle ages  the historian michael lapidge suggests that the  laudes regiae   which are included in cotton vitellius e xii  might have been composed by ealdred  or a member of his household  another historian  h  j  cowdrey  argued that the  laudes  were composed at winchester  these praise songs are probably the same performed at matilda s coronation  but might have been used at other court ceremonies before ealdred s death 

historians have seen ealdred as an  old fashioned prince bishop   others say that he  raised the see of york from its former rustic state   he was known for his generosity and for his diplomatic and administrative abilities  after the conquest  ealdred provided a degree of continuity between the pre  and post conquest worlds  one modern historian feels that it was ealdred who was behind the compilation of the d version of the  anglo saxon chronicle   and gives a date in the     s as its composition  certainly  ealdred is one of the leading figures in the work  and it is likely that one of his clerks compiled the version 




alexander i of epirus

alexander i of epirus    c       bc          bc   also known as alexander molossus     was a king of epirus               bc  of the aeacid dynasty  as the son of neoptolemus i and brother of olympias  alexander i was an uncle of alexander the great  he was also an uncle of pyrrhus of epirus 

neoptolemus i ruled jointly with his brother arybbas  when neoptolemus died in c      bc  his son alexander was only a child and arrybas became the sole king  in c      bc  alexander was brought to the court of philip ii of macedon in order to protect him  in       at the age of about     philip made him king of epirus  after dethroning his uncle arybbas 

when olympias was repudiated by her husband in     bc  she went to her brother  and endeavoured to induce him to make war on philip  alexander  however  declined the contest  and formed a second alliance with philip by agreeing to marry the daughter of philip  alexander s niece  cleopatra  during the wedding in     bc  philip was assassinated by pausanias of orestis 

in      bc  alexander i  at the request of the greek colony of taras  in magna graecia   crossed over into italy  to aid them in battle against several italic tribes  including the lucanians and bruttii  after a victory over the samnites and lucanians near paestum in      bc  he made a treaty with the romans  he then took heraclea from the lucanians  and terina and sipontum from the bruttii  through the treachery of some lucanian exiles  he was compelled to engage under unfavourable circumstances in the battle of pandosia and was killed by a lucanian  he left a son  neoptolemus  and a daughter  cadmea 

in a famous passage  livy speculates on what would have been the outcome of a military showdown between alexander the great and the roman republic  he reports that as alexander of epirus lay mortally wounded on the battlefield at pandosia he compared his fortunes to those of his famous nephew and said that the latter  waged war against women  

 




alexander balas

alexander i theopator euergetes  surnamed balas     was the ruler of the greek seleucid kingdom in     summer         august     bc  alexander defeated demetrius soter for the crown in     bc  ruling briefly  he lost the crown to demetrius ii nicator during his defeat at the battle of antioch      bc  in syria  dying shortly after 

he is the title character of the oratorio  alexander balus   written in      by george frideric handel 

he was a native of smyrna of humble origin  but gave himself out to be the son of antiochus iv epiphanes and laodice iv and heir to the seleucid throne  along with his sister laodice vi  the youngster alexander was  discovered  by heracleides  a former minister of antiochus iv and brother of timarchus  an usurper in media who had been executed by the reigning king demetrius i soter 

alexander s claims were recognized by the roman senate  ptolemy philometor of egypt and others  he married cleopatra thea  a daughter of the ptolemaic dynasty  at first unsuccessful  alexander finally defeated demetrius soter in     bc  being now master of the empire  he is said to have abandoned himself to a life of debauchery  whatever the truth behind this  the young king was forced to depend heavily on his ptolemaic support and even struck portraits with the characteristic features of king ptolemy i 

demetrius soter s son demetrius ii profited by the opportunity to regain the throne  ptolemy philometor  who was alexander s father in law  went over to his side  and alexander was defeated in the battle of antioch      bc  in syria  sometimes known as the battle of the oenoparus 

he fled for refuge to a nabataean prince  who murdered him and sent his head to ptolemy philometor  who had been mortally wounded in the engagement 








alexander of pherae

alexander    was  tagus  or despot of pherae in thessaly  and ruled from     to c      bc  following the assassination of the tyrant jason of pherae  in     bc  his brother polydorus ruled for a year  but he was then poisoned by another brother  alexander  alexander governed tyrannically and was constantly seeking to control thessaly and the kingdom of macedonia  he also engaged in piratical raids on attica  alexander was murdered by the brothers of his wife  thebe  as it was said that she lived in fear of her husband and hated alexander s cruel and brutal character 

the accounts of how alexander came to power vary somewhat in minor points  diodorus siculus tells us that upon the assassination of the tyrant jason of pherae  in     bc  his brother polydorus ruled for a year  but he was then poisoned by alexander  another brother  however  according to xenophon  polydorus was murdered by his brother polyphron  who was  in turn  murdered by his nephew alexander    son of jason  in     bc  plutarch relates that alexander worshipped the spear he slew his uncle with as if it were a god  alexander governed tyrannically  and according to diodorus  differently from the former rulers  but polyphron  at least  seems to have set him the example  the states of thessaly  which had previously acknowledged the authority of jason of pherae  were not so willing to submit to alexander the tyrant   especially the old family of the aleuadae of larissa  who had most reason to fear him   therefore  they applied for help from alexander ii of macedon 

alexander prepared to meet his enemy in macedonia  but the king anticipated him  and  reaching larissa  was admitted into the city  alexander withdrew to pherae whilst the macedonian king placed a garrison in larissa  as well as in crannon  which had also come over to him  but once the bulk of the macedonian army had retired  the states of thessaly feared the return and vengeance of alexander  and so sent for aid to thebes  whose policy it was to put a check on any neighbour who might otherwise become too formidable  thebes accordingly dispatched pelopidas to the aid of thessaly  on arrival of pelopidas at larissa  whence according to diodorus  he dislodged the macedonian garrison  alexander presented himself and offered submission  when pelopidas expressed indignation at the tales of alexander s profligacy and cruelty  alexander took alarm and fled 

these events appear to refer to the early part of     bc  in the summer of that year pelopidas was again sent into thessaly  in consequence of fresh complaints against alexander  accompanied by ismenias  he went merely as a negotiator  without any military force  and was seized by alexander and thrown into prison  the scholar william mitford suggested that pelopidas was taken prisoner in battle  but the language of demosthenes hardly supports such an inference  the thebans sent a large army into thessaly to rescue pelopidas  but they could not keep the field against the superior cavalry of alexander  who  aided by auxiliaries from athens  pursued them with great slaughter  the destruction of the whole theban army is said to only have been averted by the ability of epaminondas  who was serving in the campaign  but not as general 

in     bc alexander carried out a massacre of the citizens of scotussa  a fresh theban expedition into thessaly  under epaminondas resulted  according to plutarch  in a three year truce and the release of prisoners  including pelopidas  during the next three years  alexander seemed to renew his attempts to subdue the states of thessaly  especially magnesia and phthiotis  for upon the expiry of the truce  in     bc  they again applied to thebes for protection from him  the theban army under pelopidas is said to have been dismayed by an eclipse  on    july     bc  see  th century bc eclipses   and pelopidas  leaving the bulk of his army behind  entered thessaly at the head of three hundred volunteer horsemen and some mercenaries  at cynoscephalae  the thebans defeated alexander  but pelopidas was killed  this was closely followed by another theban victory under malcites and diogiton  alexander was then forced to restore the conquered towns to the thessalians  confine himself to pherae  join the boeotian league  and become a dependent ally of thebes 

if the death of epaminondas in     freed athens from fear of thebes  it appears at the same time to have exposed it to further aggression from alexander  who made a piratical raid on tinos and other cities of the cyclades  plundering them  and making slaves of the inhabitants  he also besieged peparethus  and  even landed troops in attica itself  and seized the port of panormus  a little eastward of sounion   the athenian admiral leosthenes defeated alexander and managed to relieve peparethus  but alexander escaped from being blockaded in panormus  took several attic triremes  and plundered the piraeus 

the murder of alexander is assigned by diodorus to          plutarch gives a detailed account of it  with a lively picture of the palace  guards watched throughout the night  except at alexander s bedchamber  which was at the top of a ladder with a ferocious chained dog guarding the door  thebe  alexander s wife and cousin  or half sister  as the daughter of jason of pherae   concealed her three brothers in the house during the day  had the dog removed when alexander had gone to rest  and  having covered the steps of the ladder with wool  brought up the young men to her husband s chamber  though she had taken away alexander s sword  they feared to set about the deed until she threatened to wake him  her brothers then entered and killed alexander  his body was cast into the streets  and exposed to every indignity 

of thebe s motive for the murder different accounts are given  plutarch states it to have been fear of her husband  together with hatred of alexander s cruel and brutal character  and ascribes these feelings principally to the representations of pelopidas  when she visited him in his prison  in cicero the deed is ascribed to jealousy  other accounts have it that alexander had taken thebe s youngest brother as his eromenos and tied him up  exasperated by his wife s pleas to release the youth  he murdered the boy  which drove her to revenge 

it is written in plutarch s second oration on the fortune or the virtue of alexander the great  see  moralia    and in claudius aelianus   varia historia  that alexander left a tragedy in a theatre because he did not wish to weep at fiction when unmoved by his own cruelty  this suggests that while alexander was a tyrant  perhaps his iron heart could be softened  the actor was threatened with punishment because alexander was so moved while watching 





alexander ii of epirus

alexander ii was a king of epirus  and the son of pyrrhus and lanassa  the daughter of the sicilian tyrant agathocles 

he succeeded his father as king in     bc  and continued the war which his father had begun with antigonus ii gonatas  whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of macedon 
he was  however  dispossessed of both macedon and epirus by demetrius ii of macedon  the son of antigonus ii  upon which he took refuge amongst the acarnanians  by their assistance and that of his own subjects  who entertained a great attachment for him  he recovered epirus  it appears that he was in alliance with the aetolians  

alexander married his paternal half sister olympias  by whom he had two sons  pyrrhus  ptolemy and a daughter  phthia  on the death of alexander  around     bc  olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons  and married phthia to demetrius  
there are extant silver and copper coins of this king  
the former bear a youthful head covered with the skin of an elephant s head  
the reverse represents pallas holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other  and before her stands an eagle on a thunderbolt 

one alexander is mentioned in the edicts of ashoka  as one of several rulers in the west to receive the  religious emissionaries  of the third indian emperor of the maruya dynasty ashoka around     bce  however  alexander of corinth and alexander  seleucid vicegerent at sardis have more arguments on their side 

 




alexander jagiellon

alexander i jagiellon         august             august       of the house of jagiellon was the grand duke of lithuania and later also king of poland  he was the fourth son of casimir iv jagiellon  he was elected grand duke of lithuania on the death of his father         and king of poland on the death of his brother john i albert        

alexander was born as the fourth son of king casimir iv jagiellon of poland and elisabeth habsburg of hungary  daughter of the king albert of hungary  at the time of his father s death in       his eldest brother vladislaus had already become king of bohemia        and hungary and croatia         and the next oldest brother  casimir  had died        after leading an ascetic and pious life in his final years  resulting in his eventual canonization  while the third oldest brother  john i albert was chosen by the polish nobility   szlachta   to be the next king of poland  the lithuanians instead elected alexander to be their next grand duke  

the greatest challenge that alexander faced upon assuming control of the grand duchy was an attack on lithuania by grand duke of muscovy ivan iii and his allies  the tatars of the crimean khanate  which commenced shortly after his coronation  ivan iii considered himself the heir to the lands of kievan rus   and was striving to take back the territory previously gained by lithuania  unable to successfully stop the incursions  alexander sent a delegation to moscow to make a peace settlement  which was signed in      and ceded extensive land over to the grand duchy of muscovy  in an additional effort to instill a peace between lithuania and muscovy  alexander was betrothed to helena  the daughter of ivan iii  they were married in vilnius on    february       the peace did not last long  however  as ivan iii resumed hostilities in       the most the grand duke of lithuania could do was to garrison smolensk and other strongholds and employ his wife helena to mediate another truce between him and her father after the disastrous battle of vedrosha         in the terms of this truce  lithuania had to surrender about a third of its territory to the nascent expansionist russian state 

on    june       alexander s older brother john i albert died suddenly  and alexander was crowned king of poland on    december of that year  alexander s shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the polish senate and  szlachta   who deprived him of control of the mint  then one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the polish kings   curtailed his prerogatives  and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position  in       the  sejm  passed the act of  nihil novi   which forbade the king to issue laws without the consent of the nobility  represented by the two legislative chambers  except for laws governing royal cities  crown lands  mines  fiefdoms  royal peasants  and jews  this was another step in poland s progression towards a  noble s democracy  

during alexander s reign  poland suffered additional humiliation at the hands of her subject principality  moldavia  only the death of stephen  the great  hospodar  of moldavia  enabled poland still to hold her own on the danube river  meanwhile the liberality of pope julius ii  who issued no fewer than    bulls in favor of poland and granted alexander peter s pence and other financial help  enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the teutonic order 

alexander jagiellon never felt at home in poland  and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow lithuanians  the most notable of whom was the wealthy lithuanian magnate michael glinski  who justified his master s confidence by his great victory over the tatars at kleck    august        news of which was brought to alexander on his deathbed in vilnius 

it is important to note that alexander was the last known ruler of the gediminid dynasty to have maintained the family s ancestral lithuanian language  after his death  polish became the sole language of the family  thus fully polonising the jagiellons 

in       during the refurbishment of vilnius cathedral  the forgotten sarcophagus of alexander was discovered  and has since been put on display 






alexander iii of russia

alexander iii               was the emperor of russia  king of poland  and grand duke of finland from until his death on   he was highly conservative and reversed some of the liberal reforms of his father  alexander ii  during alexander s reign russia fought no major wars  and he was therefore styled  the peacemaker     

grand duke alexander alexandrovich was born on    march      at the winter palace in saint petersburg  russian empire  the second son and third child of emperor alexander ii and his first wife maria alexandrovna  n  e princess marie of hesse  

in disposition alexander bore little resemblance to his soft hearted  liberal father  and still less to his refined  philosophic  sentimental  chivalrous  yet cunning great uncle  emperor alexander i  who could have been given the title of  the first gentleman of europe   although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the ballet  alexander was seen as lacking refinement and elegance  indeed  he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects  his straightforward  abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness  while his direct  unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough hewn  immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements  his education was not such as to soften these peculiarities  more than six feet tall  about      m   he was also noted for his immense physical strength  a sebaceous cyst on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries  and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent 

an account from the memoirs of the artist alexander benois gives one impression of alexander iii 

after a performance of the ballet  tsar kandavl  at the mariinsky theatre  i first caught sight of the emperor  i was struck by the size of the man  and although cumbersome and heavy  he was still a mighty figure  there was indeed something of the muzhik   russian peasant   about him  the look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me  as he passed where i was standing  he raised his head for a second  and to this day i can remember what i felt as our eyes met  it was a look as cold as steel  in which there was something threatening  even frightening  and it struck me like a blow  the tsar s gaze  the look of a man who stood above all others  but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him  in later years i came into contact with the emperor on several occasions  and i felt not the slightest bit timid  in more ordinary cases tsar alexander iii could be at once kind  simple  and even almost homely 

though he was destined to be a strongly counter reforming emperor  alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life  as he had an elder brother  nicholas  who seemed of robust constitution  even when nicholas first displayed symptoms of delicate health  the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously  and he was betrothed to princess dagmar of denmark  daughter of king christian ix of denmark and queen louise of denmark  and whose siblings included king frederick viii of denmark  alexandra  queen of the united kingdom and king george i of greece  great solicitude was devoted to the education of nicholas as tsesarevich  whereas alexander received only the training of an ordinary grand duke of that period  this included acquaintance with french  english and german  and military drill 

alexander became tsesarevich upon nicholas s sudden death in       it was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under konstantin pobedonostsev  then a professor of civil law at moscow state university and later  from       chief procurator of the holy synod of the orthodox church in russia  pobedonostsev instilled into the young man s mind the belief that zeal for russian orthodox thought was an essential factor of russian patriotism to be cultivated by every right minded emperor  while he was heir apparent from      to      alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs  but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government 

on his deathbed the previous tsesarevich was said to have expressed the wish that his fianc  e  princess dagmar of denmark  should marry his successor  this wish was swiftly realized when on in the grand church of the winter palace in st  petersburg  alexander wed dagmar  who converted to orthodox christianity and took the name maria feodorovna  the union proved a happy one to the end  unlike his father s  there was no adultery in his marriage  the couple spent their wedding night at the tsesarevich s private dacha known as  my property  

later on the tsesarevich became estranged from his father  this was due to their vastly differing political views  as well was his resentment towards alexander ii s long standing relationship with catherine dolgorukov  with whom he had several illegitimate children  while his mother  the empress  was suffering from chronic ill health  to the scandal of many at court  including the tsesarevich himself  alexander ii married catherine a mere month after marie alexandrovna s death in      

on   march       o s   alexander s father  alexander ii  was assassinated by members of the terrorist organization narodnaya volya  as a result  he ascended to the russian imperial throne in nennal on    march       he and maria feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed at the assumption cathedral in moscow on    may       alexander s ascension to the throne was followed by an outbreak of anti jewish riots 

alexander iii disliked the extravagance of the rest of his family  it was also expensive for the crown to pay so many grand dukes each year  each one received an annual salary of         rubles  and grand duchesses received a dowry of a million when they married  he limited the title of grand duke and duchess to only children and male line grandchildren of emperors  the rest would bear a princely title and the style of serene highness  he also forbade morganatic marriages  as well as those outside of the orthodoxy 

on the day of his assassination alexander ii had signed an ukaz setting up consultative commissions to advise the monarch  on ascending to the throne  however  alexander iii took pobedonostsev s advice and canceled the policy before its publication  he made it clear that his autocracy would not be limited 

all of alexander iii s internal reforms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his father s reign  the new emperor believed that remaining true to russian orthodoxy  autocracy  and nationality  the ideology introduced by his grandfather  emperor nicholas i  would save russia from revolutionary agitation  alexander s political ideal was a nation composed of a single nationality  language  and religion  as well as one form of administration  he attempted to realize this by the institution of mandatory teaching of the russian language throughout the empire  including to his german  polish  and other non russian subjects  with the exception of the finns   by the patronization of eastern orthodoxy  by the destruction of the remnants of german  polish  and swedish institutions in the respective provinces  and by the weakening of judaism through persecution of the jews  the latter policy was implemented in the  may laws  of       which banned jews from inhabiting rural areas and shtetls  even within the pale of settlement  and restricted the occupations in which they could engage 

alexander weakened the power of the  zemstvo   elective local administrative bodies resembling british parish councils  and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land owning proprietors appointed by his government  these  land captains    zemskiye nachalniki   were feared and resented throughout the empire s peasant communities  these acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought imperial administration under the emperor s personal control 

in such policies alexander iii had the encouragement of konstantin pobedonostsev  who retained control of the church in russia through his long tenure as procurator of the holy synod  from      to       and who became tutor to alexander s son and heir  nicholas   pobedonostsev appears as  toporov  in tolstoy s novel  resurrection    other conservative advisors included count d  a  tolstoy  minister of education  and later of internal affairs  and i  n  durnovo  d  a  tolstoy s successor in the latter post   mikhail katkov and other journalists supported the emperor in his autocracy 

encouraged by its successful assassination of alexander ii  the narodnaya volya movement began planning the murder of alexander iii  the okhrana uncovered the plot and five of the conspirators  including alexander ulyanov  the older brother of vladimir lenin  were captured and hanged on   

the famine of             and the ensuing cholera epidemic permitted some liberal activity  as the russian government could not cope with the crisis and had to allow zemstvos to help with relief  among others  tolstoy helped organize soup kitchens  and chekhov directed anti cholera precautions in several villages  

in foreign affairs alexander iii was a man of peace  but not at any price  and held that the best means of averting war is to be well prepared for it  diplomat nikolay girs  scion of a rich and powerful family of scandinavian descent  served as his foreign minister             and established the peaceful policies for which alexander has been given credit  girs was an architect of the franco russian alliance of       which was later expanded into the triple entente with the addition of great britain  that alliance brought france out of diplomatic isolation  and moved russia from the german orbit to a coalition with france  that was strongly supported by french financial assistance to russia s economic modernization  girs was in charge of a diplomacy that featured numerous negotiated settlements  treaties and conventions  these agreements defined russian boundaries and restored equilibrium to dangerously unstable situations  the most dramatic success came in       settling long standing tensions with great britain  which was fearful that russian expansion to the south would be a threat to india  girs was usually successful in restraining the aggressive inclinations of tsar alexander convincing him that the very survival of the czarist system depended on avoiding major wars  with a deep insight into the tsar s moods and views  girs was usually able to shape the final decisions by outmaneuvering hostile journalists  ministers  and even the czarina  as well as his own ambassadors  his russia fought no wars 

though alexander was indignant at the conduct of german chancellor otto von bismarck towards russia  he avoided an open rupture with germany   even reviving the league of three emperors for a period of time   and in       signed the reinsurance treaty with the germans  however  in       the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of bismarck by the new german emperor  kaiser wilhelm ii  for whom the tsar had an immense dislike   and the unwillingness of wilhelm ii s government to renew the treaty  in response alexander iii then began cordial relations with france  eventually entering into an alliance with the french in      

despite chilly relations with berlin  the tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the german frontier  with regard to bulgaria he exercised similar self control  the efforts of prince alexander and afterwards of stambolov to destroy russian influence in the principality roused his indignation  but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms 

in central asian affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending russian domination without provoking conflict with the united kingdom  see panjdeh incident   and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of a forward policy to get out of hand  his reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of russian history  but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress 

alexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at langinkoski manor near kotka on the finnish coast  where their children were immersed in a scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty 

alexander deprecated foreign influence  german influence in particular  thus the adoption of local national principles was off in all spheres of official activity  with a view to realizing his ideal of a russia homogeneous in language  administration and religion  these ideas conflicted with those of his father  who had german sympathies despite being a patriot  alexander ii often used the german language in his private relations  occasionally ridiculed the slavophiles and based his foreign policy on the prussian alliance 

some differences had first appeared during the franco prussian war  when alexander ii supported the cabinet of berlin while the tsesarevich made no effort to conceal his sympathies for the french  these sentiments would resurface during            when the eastern question excited russian society  at first the tsesarevich was more slavophile than the government  but his phlegmatic nature restrained him from many exaggerations  and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in bulgaria  where he commanded the left wing of the invading army  never consulted on political questions  alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner  after many mistakes and disappointments  the army reached constantinople and the treaty of san stefano was signed  but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the congress of berlin 

bismarck failed to do what was expected of him by the russian emperor  in return for the russian support which had enabled him to create the german empire  it was thought that he would help russia to solve the eastern question in accordance with russian interests  but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of saint petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of  honest broker  at the congress  and shortly afterwards contracted an alliance with austria hungary for the purpose of counteracting russian designs in eastern europe 

the tsesarevich could refer to these results as confirmation of the views he had expressed during the franco prussian war  he concluded that for russia  the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion  and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization  in accordance with this conviction  he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced 

following his father s assassination  alexander iii was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the winter palace  as a result  alexander relocated his family to the gatchina palace  located twenty miles south of st  petersburg  making it his primary residence  under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into st  petersburg  but even then he would stay in the anichkov palace  as opposed to the winter palace 

in the     s alexander fell madly in love with his mother s lady in waiting  princess maria elimovna meshcherskaya  dismayed to learn that prince wittgenstein had proposed to her in early       he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights of succession in order to marry his beloved  dusenka   on    may       alexander ii informed his son that russia had come to an agreement with the parents of princess dagmar of denmark  his fourth cousin  before then  she had been the fianc  e of his late elder brother nicholas  at first alexander refused to travel to copenhagen  declaring that he did not love dagmar and his desire to marry maria  in response the enraged emperor ordered alexander to go straight to denmark and propose to princess dagmar  the tsesarevich then realised that he was not a free man and that duty had to come first and foremost  the only thing left to do was to write in his diary  farewell  dear dusenka   maria was forced to leave russia  accompanied by her aunt  princess chernyshova  almost a year after her first appearance in paris  pavel pavlovich demidov   nd prince di san donato  fell in love with her and the couple married in       maria would die giving birth to her son elim pavlovich demidov   rd prince di san donato  alexander s reaction to the news of her death and the birth of her child is unknown 

alexander soon grew fond of dagmar and had six children by her  five of whom survived into adulthood  nicholas  b         george  b         xenia  b         michael  b        and olga  b         of his five surviving children  he was closest to his youngest two  in      it was alexander who commissioned peter carl faberg   to produce the first of what were to become a series of jeweled easter eggs  now called  faberg   eggs   for her as an easter gift  the first hen egg  which delighted her immensely and became an annual easter tradition for alexander and  upon his succession  for his son nicholas as well 

each summer his parents in law  king christian ix and queen louise  held family reunions at the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff  bringing alexander  maria and their children to denmark  his sister in law  the princess of wales  would come from great britain with some of her children  and his brother in law  king george i of greece  his wife  queen olga  who was a first cousin of alexander and a romanov grand duchess by birth  came with their children from athens  in contrast to the strict security observed in russia  alexander and maria revelled in the relative freedom that they enjoyed in denmark  alexander once commenting to the prince and princess of wales near the end of a visit that he envied them being able to return to a happy home in england  while he was returning to his russian prison  in denmark  he was able to enjoy joining his children in muddy ponds looking for tadpoles  sneaking into his father in law s orchard to steal apples  and playing pranks  such as turning a water hose on the visiting king oscar ii of sweden 

as tsesarevich   and then as tsar   alexander had an extremely poor relationship with his brother grand duke vladimir  this tension was reflected in the rivalry between maria feodorovna and vladimir s wife  grand duchess marie pavlovna  alexander had better relationships with his other brothers  alexei  whom he made rear admiral and then a grand admiral of the russian navy   sergei  whom he made governor of moscow  and paul 

despite the antipathy that alexander had towards his stepmother  princess catherine dolgorukov  he nevertheless allowed her to remain in the winter palace for some time after his father s assassination and to retain various keepsakes of him  these included alexander ii s blood soaked uniform that he died wearing  and his reading glasses 

on the imperial train derailed in an accident at borki  at the moment of the crash  the imperial family was in the dining car  its roof collapsed  and alexander held its remains on his shoulders as the children fled outdoors  the onset of alexander   s kidney failure was later attributed to the blunt trauma suffered in this incident 

in       alexander iii became ill with terminal kidney disease  nephritis   maria fyodorovna s sister in law  queen olga of greece  offered her villa of mon repos  on the island of corfu  in the hope that it might improve the tsar s condition  by the time that they reached crimea  they stayed at the maly palace in livadia  as alexander was too weak to travel any further  recognizing that the tsar s days were numbered  various imperial relatives began to descend on livadia  even the famed clergyman john of kronstadt paid a visit and administered communion to the tsar  on    october  alexander received nicholas s fianc  e  princess alix  who had come from her native darmstadt to receive the tsar s blessing  despite being exceedingly weak  alexander insisted on receiving alix in full dress uniform  an event that left him exhausted  soon after  his health began to deteriorate more rapidly  he died in the arms of his wife  and in the presence of his physician  ernst viktor von leyden  at maly palace in livadia on the afternoon of at the age of forty nine  and was succeeded by his eldest son tsesarevich nicholas  who took the throne as nicholas ii  after leaving livadia on   november and traveling to st  petersburg by way of moscow  his remains were interred on    november at the peter and paul fortress 

alexander iii had six children  five of whom survived to adulthood  of his marriage with princess dagmar of denmark  also known as marie feodorovna 

in       a bronze equestrian statue of alexander iii sculpted by paolo troubetzkoy was placed in znamenskaya square in front of the moscow rail terminal in st  petersburg  both the horse and rider were sculpted in massive form  leading to the nickname of  hippopotamus   troubetzkoy envisioned the statue as a caricature  jesting that he wished  to portray an animal atop another animal   and it was quite controversial at the time  with many  including the members of the imperial family  opposed to the design  but it was approved because of the empress dowager unexpectedly liking the monument  following the revolution of      the statue remained in place as a symbol of tsarist autocracy until      when it was placed in storage  in      it was again put on public display  in front of the marble palace 
another memorial is located in the city of irkutsk at the angara embankment 

on    november       vladimir putin unveiled a bronze monument to alexander iii on the site of the former maly livadia palace in crimea  the four meter monument by russian sculptor andrey kovalchuk depicts alexander iii sitting on a stump  his stretched arms resting on a sabre  an inscription repeats his alleged saying     russia has only two allies  the army and the navy     










alexander i of scotland

alexander i  medieval gaelic   alaxandair mac ma  l coluim   modern gaelic   alasdair mac mhaol chaluim   c              april        posthumously nicknamed the fierce  was the king of scotland from      to his death 

alexander was the fifth son of malcolm iii by his wife margaret of wessex  grandniece of edward the confessor  alexander was named after pope alexander ii 

he was the younger brother of king edgar  who was unmarried  and his brother s heir presumptive by       and perhaps earlier   in that year he was the senior layman present at the examination of the remains of saint cuthbert at durham prior to their re interment  he held lands in scotland north of the forth and in lothian 

on the death of edgar in      he succeeded to the scottish crown  but  in accordance with edgar s instructions  their brother david was granted an appanage in southern scotland  edgar s will granted david the lands of the former kingdom of strathclyde or cumbria  and this was apparently agreed in advance by edgar  alexander  david and their brother in law henry i of england  in       perhaps at henry s instigation  and with the support of his anglo norman allies  david demanded  and received  additional lands in lothian along the upper tweed and teviot  david did not receive the title of king  but of  prince of the cumbrians   and his lands remained under alexander s final authority 

the dispute over tweeddale and teviotdale does not appear to have damaged relations between alexander and david  although it was unpopular in some quarters  a gaelic poem laments it s bad what malcolm s son has done dividing us from alexander he causes  like each king s son before the plunder of stable alba 

the dispute over the eastern marches does not appear to have caused lasting trouble between alexander and henry of england  in      he joined henry on campaign in wales against gruffudd ap cynan of gwynedd  alexander s marriage with henry s illegitimate daughter sybilla of normandy may have occurred as early as       or as at late as      

william of malmesbury s account attacks sybilla  but the evidence argues that alexander and sybilla were a devoted but childless couple and sybilla was of noteworthy piety  sybilla died in unrecorded circumstances at  eilean nam ban   kenmore on loch tay  in july      and was buried at dunfermline abbey  alexander did not remarry and walter bower wrote that he planned an augustinian priory at the  eilean nam ban  dedicated to sybilla s memory  and he may have taken steps to have her venerated 

alexander had at least one illegitimate child  m  el coluim mac alaxandair  who was later to be involved in a revolt against david i in the     s  he was imprisoned at roxburgh for many years afterwards  perhaps until his death some time after      

alexander was  like his brothers edgar and david  a notably pious king  he was responsible for foundations at scone and inchcolm  his mother s chaplain and hagiographer thurgot was named bishop of saint andrews  or  cell r  gmonaid   in       presumably by alexander s order  the case of thurgot s would be successor eadmer shows that alexander s wishes were not always accepted by the religious community  perhaps because eadmer had the backing of the archbishop of canterbury  ralph d escures  rather than thurstan of york  alexander also patronised saint andrews  granting lands intended for an augustinian priory  which may have been the same as that intended to honour his wife 

for all his religiosity  alexander was not remembered as a man of peace  john of fordun says of him 
he manifested the terrible aspect of his character in his reprisals in the mormaerdom of moray  andrew of wyntoun s  orygynale cronykil of scotland  says that alexander was holding court at invergowrie when he was attacked by  men of the isles   walter bower says the attackers were from moray and mearns  alexander pursued them north  to  stockford  in ross  near beauly  where he defeated them  this  says wyntoun  is why he was named the  fierce   the dating of this is uncertain  as are his enemies  identity  however  in      the annals of ulster report   ladhmann son of domnall  grandson of the king of scotland  was killed by the men of moray   the king referred to is alexander s father  malcolm iii  and domnall was alexander s half brother  the mormaerdom or kingdom of moray was ruled by the family of macbeth  mac bethad mac findl  ich  and lulach  lulach mac gille coemg  in   not overmighty subjects  but a family who had ruled alba within little more than a lifetime  who the mormaer or king was at this time is not known  it may have been   engus of moray or his father  whose name is not known  as for the mearns  the only known mormaer of mearns  m  el petair  had murdered alexander s half brother duncan ii  donnchad mac ma  l coluim  in      

alexander died in april      at his court at stirling  his brother david  probably the acknowledged heir since the death of sybilla  succeeded him

alexander ii of scotland

alexander ii  mediaeval gaelic     modern gaelic        august       july       was king of scots from
     until his death in      

he was born at haddington  east lothian  the only son of the scottish king william the lion and ermengarde of beaumont  he spent time in england  john of england knighted him at clerkenwell priory in       before succeeding to the kingdom on the death of his father on   december       being crowned at scone on   december the same year 

in       the year after his accession  the clans meic uilleim and macheths  inveterate enemies of the scottish crown  broke into revolt  but loyalist forces speedily quelled the insurrection  in the same year alexander joined the english barons in their struggle against john of england  and led an army into the kingdom of england in support of their cause  this action led to the sacking of berwick upon tweed as john s forces ravaged the north 

the scottish forces reached the south coast of england at the port of dover where in september       alexander paid homage to the pretender prince louis of france for his lands in england  chosen by the barons to replace king john  but john having died  the pope and the english aristocracy changed their allegiance to his nine year old son  henry  forcing the french and the scots armies to return home 

peace between henry iii  louis of france  and alexander followed on    september      with the treaty of kingston  diplomacy further strengthened the reconciliation by the marriage of alexander to henry s sister joan of england on    june or    june      

the next year marked the subjection of the hitherto semi independent district of argyll  much smaller than the modern area by that name  it only comprised craignish  ardscotnish  glassary  glenary  and cowal  lorn was a separate province  while kintyre and knapdale were part of su  reyar   royal forces crushed a revolt in galloway in      without difficulty  nor did an invasion attempted soon afterwards by its exiled leaders meet with success  soon afterwards a claim for homage from henry of england drew forth from alexander a counter claim to the northern english counties  the two kingdoms  however  settled this dispute by a compromise in       this was the treaty of york which defined the boundary between the two kingdoms as running between the solway firth  in the west  and the mouth of the river tweed  in the east  

joan died in march      in essex  alexander married his second wife  marie de coucy  the following year on    may       together they had one son  the future alexander iii  born in      

a threat of invasion by henry in      for a time interrupted the friendly relations between the two countries  but the prompt action of alexander in anticipating his attack  and the disinclination of the english barons for war  compelled him to make peace next year at newcastle 

alexander now turned his attention to securing the western isles  which were still part of the norwegian domain of su  reyjar  he repeatedly attempted negotiations and purchase  but without success  alexander set out to conquer these islands but died on the way in       this dispute over the western isles  also known as the hebrides  was not resolved until      when magnus vi of norway ceded them to scotland along with the isle of man 

the english chronicler matthew paris in his chronica majora described alexander as red haired 

  king john  taunted king alexander  and because he was red headed  sent word to him  
saying   so shall we hunt the red fox cub from his lairs  

alexander attempted to persuade ewen  the son of duncan  lord of argyll  to sever his allegiance to haakon iv of norway  when ewen rejected these attempts  alexander sailed forth to compel him  but on the way he suffered a fever at the isle of kerrera in the inner hebrides  he died there in      and was buried at melrose abbey

   joan of england      july       march        was the eldest legitimate daughter and third child of john of england and isabella of angoul  me  she and alexander ii married on    june       at york minster  alexander was     joan was     they had no children  joan was alexander s  rd cousin  their closest common ancestor being henry i of england  joan died in essex in       and was buried at tarant crawford abbey in dorset 

   marie de coucy  who became mother of alexander iii of scotland  she was alexander s  rd cousin once removed by their common ancestor hugh i  count of vermandois

alexander i of serbia

alexander i or aleksandar obrenovi         august        june       was king of serbia from      to      when he and his wife  queen draga  were assassinated by a group of army officers  led by captain dragutin dimitrijevi   

alexander was born on    august      to king milan and queen natalie of serbia  he belonged to the obrenovi   dynasty 

in       king milan unexpectedly abdicated and withdrew to private life  proclaiming alexander king of serbia under a regency until he should attain his majority at eighteen years of age  his mother became his regent  his parents were second cousins  in       king alexander  aged sixteen  arbitrarily proclaimed himself of full age  dismissed the regents and their government  and took the royal authority into his own hands  his action won popular support  as did his appointment of a radical ministry  in may      king alexander arbitrarily abolished king milan s liberal constitution of      and restored the conservative one of       his attitude during the greco turkish war        was one of strict neutrality 

in      the young king brought his father  milan  back to serbia and  in       appointed him commander in chief of the serbian army  during that time  milan was regarded as the  de facto  ruler of the country 

in the summer of       king alexander suddenly announced his engagement to the widowed madame draga ma  in  formerly a lady in waiting to his mother and    years his senior  the proposed union aroused great opposition  not only was draga of unequal birth and from an obscure family  but at    years of age  the chances of her bearing an heir were slim  alexander was an only child  and it was imperative to secure the succession 

before making the announcement  alexander did not consult with his father  who had been on vacation in karlovy vary and making arrangements to secure the hand of german princess alexandra zu schaumburg lippe for his son  or his prime minister dr  vladan   or  evi    who was visiting the paris universal exhibition at the time of the announcement  both immediately resigned from their respective offices and alexander had difficulty in forming a new cabinet  alexander s mother also opposed the marriage and was subsequently banished from the kingdom  she was known to have been seen in the nearby countries  such as austria hungary and bulgaria 

opposition to the union seemed to subside somewhat for a time upon the publication of tsar nicholas ii s congratulations to the king on his engagement and of his acceptance to act as the principal witness at the wedding  the marriage duly took place in august       even so  the unpopularity of the union weakened the king s position in the eyes of the army and of the country at large 

king alexander tried to reconcile political parties by unveiling a liberal constitution of his own initiative  introducing for the first time in the constitutional history of serbia the system of two chambers   skup  tina  and  senate    this reconciled the political parties but did not reconcile the army which  already dissatisfied with the king s marriage  became still more so at the rumors that one of the two unpopular brothers of queen draga  lieutenant nikodije  was to be proclaimed heir presumptive to the throne 

meanwhile  the independence of the senate and of the council of state caused increasing irritation to king alexander  in march      the king suspended the constitution for half an hour  time enough to publish the decrees dismissing and replacing the old senators and councillors of state  this arbitrary act increased dissatisfaction in the country 

the general impression was that  as much as the senate was packed with men devoted to the royal couple and the government obtained a large majority at the general elections  king alexander would not hesitate any longer to proclaim queen draga s brother as the heir presumptive to the throne  in spite of this  it had been agreed with the serbian government that prince mirko of montenegro  who was married to natalija konstantinovic  the granddaughter of princess anka obrenovi    an aunt of king milan  would be proclaimed heir presumptive in the event that the marriage of king alexander and queen draga was childless 

apparently to prevent queen draga s brother being named heir presumptive  but in reality to replace alexander obrenovi   with peter kara  or  evi    a conspiracy was organized by a group of army officers headed by captain dragutin dimitrijevi   also known as  apis   and novak perisic  a young greek orthodox militant who was in the pay of the russians  as well as the leader of the black hand secret society which would assassinate archduke franz ferdinand in       several politicians were also part of the conspiracy  and allegedly included former prime minister  nikola pa  i    the royal couple s palace was invaded and they hid in a cupboard in the queen s bedroom   there is another possibility  used in a serbian tv history series  the end of the obrenovi   dynasty  in which the royal couple was hidden in a secret panic room hidden behind the mirror in a common bedroom  the room contained an entrance to a secret passage leading out of the palace  but the entrance was inaccessible due to the placement of the queen s wardrobe over it after the wedding  

the conspirators searched the palace and eventually discovered the royal couple and murdered them in the early morning of june           king alexander and queen draga were shot and their bodies mutilated and disemboweled and  according to eyewitness accounts  thrown from a second floor window of the palace onto piles of garden manure  the king was only    years old at the time of his death  king alexander and queen draga were buried in the crypt of st  mark s church  belgrade 





alexander iii of scotland

alexander iii  medieval gaelic   alaxandair mac alaxandair   modern gaelic   alasdair mac alasdair      september             march       was king of scots from      until his death in      

alexander was born at roxburgh  the only son of alexander ii by his second wife marie de coucy  alexander iii was also the grandson of william the lion  alexander s father died on   july      and he became king at the age of seven  inaugurated at scone on    july      

the years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties  the one led by walter comyn  earl of menteith  the other by alan durward  justiciar of scotia  the former dominated the early years of alexander s reign  at the marriage of alexander to margaret of england in       henry iii of england seized the opportunity to demand from his son in law homage for the scottish kingdom  but alexander did not comply  in      an interview between the english and scottish kings at kelso led to menteith and his party losing to durward s party  but though disgraced  they still retained great influence  and two years later  seizing the person of the king  they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties 

on attaining his majority at the age of    in       alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the western isles which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short  he laid a formal claim before the norwegian king haakon  haakon rejected the claim  and in the following year responded with a formidable invasion  sailing around the west coast of scotland he halted off the isle of arran  and negotiations commenced  alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin  at length haakon  weary of delay  attacked  only to encounter a terrific storm which greatly damaged his ships  the battle of largs  october       proved indecisive  but even so  haakon s position was hopeless  baffled  he turned homewards  but died in orkney on    december       the isles now lay at alexander s feet  and in      haakon s successor concluded the treaty of perth by which he ceded the isle of man and the western isles to scotland in return for a monetary payment  norway retained only orkney and shetland in the area 

alexander had married margaret  his  th cousin by henry i of england   daughter of king henry iii of england and eleanor of provence  on    december       she died in       after they had had three children 

according to the lanercost chronicle  alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone   he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm  nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs  but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons  virgins or widows as the fancy seized him  sometimes in disguise  

towards the end of alexander s reign  the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance  in      he induced the estates to recognize as his heir presumptive his granddaughter margaret  the  maid of norway   the need for a male heir led him to contract a second marriage to yolande de dreux on   november      

alexander died in a fall from his horse while riding in the dark to visit the queen at kinghorn in fife on    march      because it was her birthday the next day  he had spent the evening at edinburgh castle celebrating his second marriage and overseeing a meeting with royal advisors  he was advised by them not to make the journey to fife because of weather conditions  but he travelled anyway  alexander became separated from his guides and it is assumed that in the dark his horse lost its footing  the    year old king was found dead on the shore the following morning with a broken neck  some texts have said that he fell off a cliff  although there is no cliff at the site where his body was found  there is a very steep rocky embankment  which  would have been fatal in the dark   after alexander s death  his strong realm was plunged into a period of darkness that would eventually lead to war with england  he was buried in dunfermline abbey 

as alexander left no surviving children  the heir to the throne was his unborn child by queen yolande  when yolande s pregnancy ended  probably with a miscarriage  alexander s seven year old granddaughter margaret  maid of norway  became the heir  margaret died  still uncrowned  on her way to scotland in       the inauguration of john balliol as king on    november      ended the six years of the guardians of scotland governing the land 

the death of alexander and the subsequent period of instability in scotland was lamented in an early scots poem recorded by andrew of wyntoun in his orygynale cronykil of scotland 

in       a monument to alexander iii was erected at the approximate location of his death in kinghorn 

alexander iii has been depicted in historical novels  they include

alexander of aphrodisias

alexander of aphrodisias      was a peripatetic philosopher and the most celebrated of the ancient greek commentators on the writings of aristotle  he was a native of aphrodisias in caria  and lived and taught in athens at the beginning of the  rd century  where he held a position as head of the peripatetic school  he wrote many commentaries on the works of aristotle  extant are those on the  prior analytics    topics    meteorology    sense and sensibilia   and  metaphysics   several original treatises also survive  and include a work  on fate   in which he argues against the stoic doctrine of necessity  and one  on the soul   his commentaries on aristotle were considered so useful that he was styled  by way of pre eminence   the commentator     

alexander was a native of aphrodisias in caria and came to athens towards the end of the  nd century  he was a student of the two stoic  or possibly peripatetic  philosophers sosigenes and herminus  and perhaps of aristotle of mytilene  at athens he became head of the peripatetic school and lectured on peripatetic philosophy  alexander s dedication of  on fate  to septimius severus and caracalla  in gratitude for his position at athens  indicates a date between     and      a recently published inscription from aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the schools at athens and gives his full name as titus aurelius alexander  his full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given roman citizenship by the emperor antoninus pius  while proconsul of asia  the inscription honours his father  also called alexander and also a philosopher  this fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of alexander s corpus should be ascribed to his father 

alexander composed several commentaries on the works of aristotle  in which he sought to escape a syncretistic tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of aristotle  his extant commentaries are on  prior analytics   book      topics    meteorology    sense and sensibilia   and  metaphysics   books       the commentary on the  sophistical refutations  is deemed spurious  as is the commentary on the final nine books of the  metaphysics   the lost commentaries include works on the  de interpretatione    posterior analytics    physics    on the heavens    on generation and corruption    on the soul   and  on memory   simplicius of cilicia mentions that alexander provided commentary on the quadrature of the lunes  and the corresponding problem of squaring the circle  in april       it was reported that imaging analysis had discovered an early commentary on aristotle s  categories  in the archimedes palimpsest  and robert sharples suggested alexander as the most likely author 

there are also several extant original writings by alexander  these include   on the soul    problems and solutions    ethical problems    on fate   and  on mixture and growth   three works attributed to him are considered spurious   medical questions    physical problems   and  on fevers   additional works by alexander are preserved in arabic translation  these include   on the principles of the universe    on providence   and  against galen on motion  

 on the soul    de anima   is a treatise on the soul written along the lines suggested by aristotle in his own  de anima   alexander contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material   nous hylikos   and inseparable from the body  he argued strongly against the doctrine of the soul s immortality  he identified the active intellect   nous poietikos    through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual  with god  a second book is known as the  supplement to on the soul    mantissa    the  mantissa  is a series of twenty five separate pieces of which the opening five deal directly with psychology  the remaining twenty pieces cover problems in physics and ethics  of which the largest group deals with questions of vision and light  and the final four with fate and providence  the  mantissa  was probably not written by alexander in its current form  but much of the actual material may be his 

 problems and solutions    quaestiones   consists of three books which  although termed  problems and solutions of physical questions   treat of subjects which are not all physical  and are not all problems  among the sixty nine items in these three books  twenty four deal with physics  seventeen with psychology  eleven with logic and metaphysics  and six with questions of fate and providence  it is unlikely that alexander wrote all of the  quaestiones   some may be alexander s own explanations  while others may be exercises by his students 

 ethical problems  was traditionally counted as the fourth book of the  quaestiones   the work is a discussion of ethical issues based on aristotle  and contains responses to questions and problems deriving from alexander s school  it is likely that the work was not written by alexander himself  but rather by his pupils on the basis of debates involving alexander 

 on fate  is a treatise in which alexander argues against the stoic doctrine of necessity  in  on fate  alexander denied three things   necessity     the foreknowledge of fated events that was part of the stoic identification of god and nature  and determinism in the sense of a sequence of causes that was laid down beforehand    or predetermined by antecedents     he defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today 

 on mixture and growth  discusses the topic of mixture of physical bodies  it is both an extended discussion  and polemic  on stoic physics  and an exposition of aristotelian thought on this theme 

 on the principles of the universe  is preserved in arabic translation  this treatise is not mentioned in surviving greek sources  but it enjoyed great popularity in the muslim world  and a large number of copies have survived  the main purpose of this work is to give a general account of aristotelian cosmology and metaphysics  but it also has a polemical tone  and it may be directed at rival views within the peripatetic school  alexander was concerned with filling the gaps of the aristotelian system and smoothing out its inconsistencies  while also presenting a unified picture of the world  both physical and ethical  the topics dealt with are the nature of the heavenly motions and the relationship between the unchangeable celestial realm and the sublunar world of generation and decay  his principal sources are the  physics   book      metaphysics   book      and the pseudo aristotelian  on the universe  

 on providence  survives in two arabic versions  in this treatise  alexander opposes the stoic view that divine providence extends to all aspects of the world  he regards this idea as unworthy of the gods  instead  providence is a power that emanates from the heavens to the sublunar region  and is responsible for the generation and destruction of earthly things  without any direct involvement in the lives of individuals 

by the  th century alexander s commentaries on aristotle were considered so useful that he was referred to as  the commentator      his commentaries were greatly esteemed among the arabs  who translated many of them  and he is heavily quoted by maimonides 

in       the church council of paris issued a condemnation  which probably targeted the writings of alexander among others 

in the early renaissance his doctrine of the soul s mortality was adopted by pietro pomponazzi  against the thomists and the averroists   and by his successor cesare cremonini  this school is known as alexandrists 

alexander s band  an optical phenomenon  is named after him 

several of alexander s works were published in the aldine edition of aristotle  venice               his  de fato  and  de anima  were printed along with the works of themistius at venice         the former work  which has been translated into latin by grotius and also by schulthess  was edited by j  c  orelli  z  rich        and his commentaries on the metaphysica by h  bonitz  berlin        in      the first part of his  on aristotle metaphysics  was published as part of the ancient commentators project  since then  other works of his have been translated into english 








severus alexander

severus alexander      c          march      was roman emperor from     to     and the last emperor of the severan dynasty  he succeeded his cousin elagabalus upon the latter s assassination in      his own assassination marked the epoch event for the crisis of the third century   nearly    years of civil wars  foreign invasion  and collapse of the monetary economy  though this last part is now disputed 

alexander was the heir to his cousin  the    year old emperor who had been murdered along with his mother julia soaemias  by his own guards  who  as a mark of contempt  had their remains cast into the tiber river  he and his cousin were both grandsons of the influential and powerful julia maesa  who had arranged for elagabalus  acclamation as emperor by the famous third gallic legion  it was the rumor of alexander s death that triggered the assassination of elagabalus and his mother  his    year reign was the longest reign of a  sole  emperor since antoninus pius  he was also the second youngest ever sole legal roman emperor during the existence of the united empire  the youngest being gordian iii 

as emperor  alexander s peacetime reign was prosperous  however  rome was militarily confronted with the rising sassanid empire and growing incursions from the tribes of germania  he managed to check the threat of the sassanids  but when campaigning against germanic tribes  alexander attempted to bring peace by engaging in diplomacy and bribery  this alienated many in the roman army and led to a conspiracy to assassinate and replace him 

born between          severus alexander became emperor when he was around    years old  though he could be    or      making him the youngest emperor in rome s history  until the ascension of gordian iii  alexander s grandmother believed that he had more potential to rule than her other grandson  the increasingly unpopular emperor elagabalus  thus  to preserve her own position  she had elagabalus adopt the young alexander and then arranged for elagabalus  assassination  securing the throne for alexander  the roman army hailed alexander as emperor on    march      immediately conferring on him the titles of augustus   pater patriae  and  pontifex maximus  

throughout his life  alexander relied heavily on guidance from his grandmother  maesa  and mother  julia mamaea  maesa died in      leaving mamaea as the sole influence upon alexander s actions  as a young  immature  and inexperienced adolescent  alexander knew little about government  warcraft  or the role of ruling over an empire  because of this  throughout his entire reign he was a puppet of his mother s advice and entirely under her jurisdiction  a state of affairs that was not popular with the soldiers 

under the influence of his mother  alexander did much to improve the morals and condition of the people  and to enhance the dignity of the state  he employed noted jurists to oversee the administration of justice  such as the famous jurist ulpian  his advisers were men like the senator and historian cassius dio  and it is claimed that he created a select board of    senators  although this claim is disputed  he also created a municipal council of    who assisted the urban prefect in administering the affairs of the    districts of rome  excessive luxury and extravagance at the imperial court were diminished  and he restored the baths of nero in     or      consequently  they are sometimes also known as the baths of alexander after him 

upon his accession he reduced the silver purity of the denarius from       to         the actual silver weight dropped from       grams to       grams  however  in     he revalued the denarius  increasing the silver purity and weight to     and       grams  the following year he decreased the amount of base metal in the denarius while adding more silver  raising the silver purity and weight again to       and       grams  additionally  during his reign taxes were lightened  literature  art and science were encouraged  and  for the convenience of the people  loan offices were instituted for lending money at a moderate rate of interest 

in religious matters  alexander preserved an open mind  according to the  historia augusta   he wished to erect a temple to jesus but was dissuaded by the pagan priests  however  much of this book is full of falsifications and modern scholars deem it almost completely untrustworthy livius he allowed a synagogue to be built in rome  and he gave as a gift to this synagogue a scroll of the torah known as the severus scroll 

in legal matters  alexander did much to aid the rights of his soldiers  he confirmed that soldiers could name anyone as heirs in their will  whereas civilians had strict restrictions over who could become heirs or receive a legacy  he also confirmed that soldiers could free their slaves in their wills  protected the rights of soldiers to their property when they were on campaign  and reasserted that a soldier s property acquired in or because of military service  his  castrense peculium   could be claimed by no one else  not even the soldier s father 

on the whole  alexander s reign was prosperous until the rise  in the east  of the sassanids under ardashir i  in     a d   ardeshir invaded the roman provinces of the east  overrunning mesopotamia and penetrating possibly as far as syria and cappadocia  forcing from the young alexander a vigorous response  of the war that followed there are various accounts  according to the most detailed authority  herodian  the roman armies suffered a number of humiliating setbacks and defeats  while according to the historia augusta as well as alexander s own dispatch to the roman senate  he gained great victories  making antioch his base  he organized in     a three fold invasion of the sassanian empire  at the head of the main body he himself advanced to recapture northern mesopotamia  while another army invaded media through the mountains of armenia  and a third advanced from the south in the direction of babylon  the northernmost army gained some success  fighting in mountainous territory favorable to the roman infantry  but the southern army was surrounded and destroyed by ardashir s skilful horse archers  and alexander himself retreated after an indecisive campaign  his army wracked by indiscipline and disease  further losses were incurred by the retreating northern army in the inclement cold of armenia as it retired into winter quarters  due to an incompetent failure to establish adequate supply lines  still  mesopotamia was retaken  and ardashir was not thereafter able to extend his conquests  though his son  shapur  would obtain some success later in the century 

although the sassanids were checked for the time  the conduct of the roman army showed an extraordinary lack of discipline  in      there was a mutiny in the syrian legion  which proclaimed taurinus emperor  alexander managed to suppress the uprising  and taurinus drowned while attempting to flee across the euphrates  the emperor returned to rome and celebrated a triumph in     

alexander s reign was also characterized by a significant breakdown of military discipline  in      the praetorian guard murdered their prefect  ulpian  in alexander s presence and despite the emperor s pleas  the soldiers then fought a three day battle against the populace of rome  and this battle ended after several parts of the city were set on fire 

dio was among those who gave a highly critical account of military discipline during the time  saying that the soldiers would rather just surrender to the enemy  different reasons are given for this issue  campbell points to     the decline in the prestige of the severan dynasty  the feeble nature of alexander himself  who appeared to be no soldier and to be completely dominated by his mother s advice  and lack of real military success at a time during which the empire was coming under increasing pressure  
herodian  on the other hand  was convinced that  the emperor s miserliness  partly the result of his mother s greed  and slowness to bestow donatives  were instrumental in the fall of military discipline under alexander 

after the persian war  alexander returned to antioch with the famous origen  one of the greatest fathers of the christian church  alexander s mother  julia mamaea  asked for origen to tutor alexander in christianity 

while alexander was being educated in the christian doctrines  the northern portion of his empire was being invaded by germanic and sarmatian tribes  a new and menacing enemy started to emerge directly after alexander s success in the persian war  in      the barbarians crossed the rhine and danube in hordes that caused alarm as far as rome  the soldiers serving under alexander  already demoralized after their costly war against the persians  were further discontented with their emperor when their homes were destroyed by the barbarian invaders 

as word of the invasion spread  the emperor took the front line and went to battle against the germanic invaders  the romans prepared heavily for the war  building a fleet to carry the entire army across  however  at this point in alexander s career  he still knew little about being a general  because of this  he hoped the mere threat of his armies would be sufficient to persuade the hostile tribes to surrender  severus enforced a strict military discipline in his men that sparked a rebellion among his legions  due to incurring heavy losses against the persians  and on the advice of his mother  alexander attempted to buy the germanic tribes off  so as to gain time 

it was this decision that resulted in the legionaries looking down upon alexander  they considered him dishonorable and feared he was unfit to be emperor  under these circumstances the army swiftly looked to replace alexander 

gaius iulius verus maximinus was the next best option  he was a soldier from thrace who had a golden reputation and was working hard to increase his military status  he was also a man with superior personal strength  who rose to his present position from a peasant background  with the thracian s hailing came the end of the severan dynasty  and  with the growing animosity of severus  army towards him  the path for his assassination was paved 

alexander was forced to face his german enemies in the early months of      by the time he and his mother arrived  the situation had settled  and so his mother convinced him that to avoid violence  trying to bribe the german army to surrender was the more sensible course of action  according to historians  it was this tactic combined with insubordination from his own men that destroyed his reputation and popularity  pusillanimity was responsible for the revolt of alexander s army  resulting in severus falling victim to the swords of his own men  following the nomination of maximinus as emperor 

alexander was assassinated on    march      together with his mother  in a mutiny of the legio xxii  primigenia  at moguntiacum  mainz  while at a meeting with his generals  these assassinations secured the throne for maximinus 

lampridius documents two theories that elaborate on severus s assassination  the first claims that the disaffection of mamaea was the main motive behind the homicide  however  lampridius makes it clear that he is more supportive of an alternative theory  that alexander was murdered in sicilia  located in britain  

this theory has it that  in an open tent after his lunch  alexander was consulting with his insubordinate troops  who compared him to his cousin elagabalus  the divisive and unpopular emperor whose own assassination paved the way for alexander s reign  a german servant entered the tent and initiated the call for alexander s assassination  at which point many of the troops joined in the attack  alexander s attendants fought against the other troops but could not hold off the combined might of those seeking the emperor s assassination  within minutes  alexander was dead  his mother julia mamaea was in the same tent with alexander and soon fell victim to the same group of assassins 

alexander s death marked the end of the severan dynasty  he was the last of the syrian emperors and the first emperor to be overthrown by military discontent on a wide scale  after his death his economic policies were completely discarded  and the roman currency was devalued  this signaled the beginning of the chaotic period known as the crisis of the third century  which brought the empire to the brink of collapse 

alexander s death at the hands of his troops can also be seen as the heralding of a new role for roman emperors  though they were not yet expected to personally fight in battle during alexander s time  emperors were increasingly expected to display general competence in military affairs  thus  alexander s taking of his mother s advice to not get involved in battle  his dishonorable and unsoldierly methods of dealing with the germanic threat  and the relative failure of his military campaign against the persians were all deemed highly unacceptable by the soldiers  indeed  maximinus was able to overthrow alexander by  harping on his own military excellence in contrast to that feeble coward   yet by arrogating the power to dethrone their emperor  the legions paved the way for a half century of widespread chaos and instability 

although the senate declared the emperor and his rule damned upon the report of his death and the ascension of a replacement emperor  alexander was deified after the death of maximinus in      his  damnatio memoriae  was also reversed after maximinus s death 

alexander was married three times  his most famous wife was sallustia orbiana   augusta   whom he married in     when she was    years old  their marriage was arranged by alexander s mother  mamaea  however  as soon as orbiana received the title of  augusta   mamaea became increasingly jealous and resentful of alexander s wife due to mamaea s excessive desire of all regal female titles  alexander divorced and exiled orbiana in      after her father  seius sallustius  was executed after being accused of attempting to assassinate the emperor 

alexander s second wife was sulpicia memmia  a member of one of the most ancient patrician families in rome  her father was a man of consular rank  her grandfather s name was  catulus  

the identity of alexander s third wife is unknown  alexander did not father children with any of his wives 

according to the augustan history  a late roman work containing biographies of emperors and others  and considered by scholars to be a work of very dubious historical reliability  alexander prayed every morning in his private chapel  he was extremely tolerant of jews and christians alike  he continued all privileges towards jews during his reign  and the augustan history relates that alexander placed images of abraham and jesus in his oratory  along with other roman deities and classical figures

alexander  as the oldest living brother  had the right not only to the throne but also to salome  the widow of his deceased brother  who had died childless  and  although she was thirteen years older than him  he married her in accordance with jewish law  by her  he had two sons  the eldest  hyrcanus ii became high priest in     bc and aristobulus ii who was high priest from          bc and started a bloody civil war with his brother  ending in his capture by pompey the great  like his brother he was an avid supporter of the aristocratic priestly faction known as the sadducees  his wife salome on the other hand came from a pharisaic family  her brother was simeon ben shetach a famous pharisee leader   and was more sympathetic to their cause and protected them throughout his turbulent reign  like his father alexander also served as the high priest  this raised the ire of the rabbis who insisted that these two offices should not be combined  according to the talmud  yannai was a questionable desecrated priest  rumour had it that his mother was captured in modiin and violated  and was not allowed to serve in the temple according to the rabbis  this infuriated the king and sided with the sadducees who defended him  this incident led the king to turn against the pharisees and persecute them until his death 

alexander s first expedition was against the city of ptolemais  acre   while alexander went forward to siege the city  zoilus  ruler of the coastal city dora and straton s tower took the opportunity to see if he could perhaps save ptolemais in hopes of gaining territory  alexander s hasmonean army quickly defeated zoilus s forces with little trouble  ptolemais and zoilus then requested aid from ptolemy ix lathyros  who had been cast out by his mother cleopatra iii  ptolemy founded a kingdom in cyprus after being cast out by his mother  the situation at ptolemais was seized as an opportunity by ptolemy to possibly gain a stronghold and control the judean coast in order to invade egypt 

ptolemy landed a large army for the relief of the town  but alexander met him with treachery  arranging an alliance with him openly while secretly he sought to obtain the help of his mother against him  when alexander formed an alliance with ptolemy  ptolemy in good gesture  handed over ptolemais  zoilus  dora  and straton s tower to alexander  as soon as ptolemy learned of alexander s scheme  he invaded the galilee region capturing asochis  ptolemy also initiated an attack upon sepphoris but failed 

alexander might easily have lost his crown and judea its independence as the result of this battle  had it not been for the assistance extended by egypt  cleopatra s two jewish generals  helkias and ananias  persuaded the queen of the dangers of allowing her banished son ptolemy to remain victorious and she entrusted them with an army against him  as a result  ptolemy was forced to withdraw to cyprus  and alexander was saved  the egyptians  as compensation for their aid  desired to annex judea to their country  but considerations touching the resident egyptian jews  who were the main support of her throne  induced cleopatra to modify her longings for conquest  the egyptian army withdrawn  alexander found his hands free  and forthwith he planned new campaigns 

alexander captured gadara and the strong fortress amathus in the transjordan region  but  in an ambush set for him by theodorus  ruler of amathus  he lost the battle  alexander was more successful in his expedition against the hellenized coastal cities  what had once been philistia   capturing raphia and anthedon  finally  in    bc jannaeus outlasted the inhabitants of gaza in a year long siege  which he occupied through treachery  and gave up to be pillaged and burned by his soldiery  this victory gained judean control over the mediterranean outlet of the nabatean trade routes 

the judean civil war initially began after the conquest of gaza by jannaeus around    bc  due to jannaeus s victory at gaza  the nabatean kingdom no longer had access to the mediterranean sea  alexander soon captured gadara  which caused the nabateans to lose their main trade routes leading to rome and damascus  after losing gadara  the nabatean king obodas i launched an attack against alexander in a steep valley in gadara where alexander barely managed to escape  after jannaeus was defeated in the battle of gadara against the nabataeans  he returned to jerusalem only to be met with fierce jewish opposition 

during the jewish holiday of feast of tabernacles  alexander jannaeus  while officiating as the high priest at the temple in jerusalem  demonstrated his displeasure against the pharisees by refusing to perform the water libation ceremony properly  instead of pouring it on the altar  he poured it on his feet  the crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting alexander with the etrogim  citrons  that they were holding in their hands  outraged  he ordered soldiers to kill those who insulted him  more than       people in the temple courtyard were massacred  with further frustration  alexander had wooden barriers built around the altars preventing people from sacrificing and denied daily offerings except for the priests  he also allied himself with foreign troops such as the pisidians and the cilicians who would later help his regime during the civil war  this incident during the feast of tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the judean civil war by igniting popular opposition to jannaeus 

after jannaeus succeeded early in the war  the rebels asked for seleucid assistance  judean insurgents joined forces with demetrius iii eucaerus to fight against jannaeus  alexander had gathered       mercanaries and        jews for battle as demetrius had        soldiers and       horses  there were attempts from both sides to persuade each other to abandon but were unsuccessful  the seleucid forces defeated jannaeus at shechem  all of alexander s mercenaries were killed in battle  and alexander was forced to take refuge in the mountains  in sympathy towards jannaeus        judean rebels ultimately returned to him  if fear of this news  demetrius withdrew  nevertheless  war between jannaeus and the rebels who returend to him continuned  they fought until alexander achieved victory  most of the rebels died in battle  while the remaining rebels fled to the city of bethoma until they were defeated 

jannaeus had brought the surviving rebels back to jerusalem where he had     jews  primarily pharisees  crucified  before their deaths  alexander had the rebels  wives and children executed before their eyes as jannaeus ate with his concubines  alexender later returned the land he had seized from the nabateans in order to have them end their support for the jewish rebels  the remaining rebels  who numbered        fled by night in fear of alexander  after  all rebel hostility ceased and alexander s reign continued in peace

alexandrists

the alexandrists were a school of renaissance philosophers who  in the great controversy on the subject of personal immortality  adopted the explanation of the  de anima  given by alexander of aphrodisias 

according to the orthodox thomism of the catholic church  aristotle rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul  against this  the averroists  led by agostino nifo  introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again  these two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality  or the absorption of the individual into the eternal one 

the alexandrists  led by pietro pomponazzi  assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to aristotle  they held that aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason  hence the alexandrists denied the aristotle viewed the soul as immortal  because in their view  since they believed that aristotle viewed the soul as organically connected with the body  the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former

alexios i komnenos

alexios  i komnenos           august        latinized alexius i comnenus  was byzantine emperor from      to       although he was not the founder of the komnenian dynasty  it was during his reign that the komnenos family came to full power  inheriting a collapsing empire and faced with constant warfare during his reign against both the seljuq turks in asia minor and the normans in the western balkans  alexios was able to curb the byzantine decline and begin the military  financial  and territorial recovery known as the  komnenian restoration   the basis for this recovery were various reforms initiated by alexios  his appeals to western europe for help against the turks were also the catalyst that likely contributed to the convoking of the crusades 

alexios was the son of the domestic of the schools john komnenos and anna dalassene  and the nephew of isaac  i komnenos  emperor               alexios  father declined the throne on the abdication of isaac  who was thus succeeded by four emperors of other families between      and       under one of these emperors  romanos  iv diogenes                alexios served with distinction against the seljuq turks  under michael  vii doukas  parapinakes                and nikephoros  iii botaneiates                he was also employed  along with his elder brother isaac  against rebels in asia minor  thrace  and in epirus 

in       western mercenaries led by roussel de bailleul rebelled in asia minor  but alexios successfully subdued them by       in       he was appointed commander of the field army in the west by nikephoros  iii  in this capacity  alexios defeated the rebellions of nikephoros bryennios the elder  whose son or grandson later married alexios  daughter anna  and nikephoros basilakes  the first at the battle of kalavrye and the latter in a surprise night attack on his camp  alexios was ordered to march against his brother in law nikephoros melissenos in asia minor but refused to fight his kinsman  this did not  however  lead to a demotion  as alexios was needed to counter the expected invasion of the normans of southern italy  led by robert guiscard 

while byzantine troops were assembling for the expedition  the doukas faction at court approached alexios and convinced him to join a conspiracy against nikephoros  iii  the mother of alexios  anna dalassene  was to play a prominent role in this coup d   tat of       along with the current empress  maria of alania  first married to michael  vii doukas and secondly to nikephoros  iii botaneiates  she was preoccupied with the future of her son by michael  vii  constantine doukas  nikephoros  iii intended to leave the throne to one of his close relatives  and this resulted in maria s ambivalence and alliance with the komnenoi  though the real driving force behind this political alliance was anna dalassene 

the empress was already closely connected to the komnenoi through maria s cousin irene s marriage to isaac komnenos  so the komnenoi brothers were able to see her under the pretense of a friendly family visit  furthermore  to aid the conspiracy maria had adopted alexios as her son  though she was only five years older than he  maria was persuaded to do so on the advice of her own  alans  and her eunuchs  who had been instigated by isaac komnenos  given anna s tight hold on her family  alexios must have been adopted with her implicit approval  as a result  alexios and constantine  maria s son  were now adoptive brothers  and both isaac and alexios took an oath that they would safeguard his rights as emperor  by secretly giving inside information to the komnenoi  maria was an invaluable ally 

as stated in the alexiad  isaac and alexios left constantinople in mid february      to raise an army against botaneiates  however  when the time came  anna quickly and surreptitiously mobilized the remainder of the family and took refuge in the hagia sophia  from there she negotiated with the emperor for the safety of family members left in the capital  while protesting her sons  innocence of hostile actions  under the falsehood of making a vesperal visit to worship at the church  she deliberately excluded the grandson of botaneiates and his loyal tutor  met with alexios and isaac  and fled for the forum of constantine  the tutor discovered they were missing and eventually found them on the palace grounds  but anna was able to convince him that they would return to the palace shortly  then to gain entrance to both the outer and inner sanctuary of the church  the women pretended to the gatekeepers that they were pilgrims from cappadocia who had spent all their funds and wanted to worship before starting their return trip  however  before they were to gain entry into the sanctuary  straboromanos and royal guards caught up with them to summon them back to the palace  anna then protested that the family was in fear for their lives  her sons were loyal subjects  alexios and isaac were discovered absent without leave   and had learned of a plot by enemies of the komnenoi to have them both blinded and had  therefore  fled the capital so they may continue to be of loyal service to the emperor  she refused to go with them and demanded that they allow her to pray to the mother of god for protection  this request was granted and anna then manifested her true theatrical and manipulative capabilities 

nikephoros  iii botaneiates was forced into a public vow that he would grant protection to the family  straboromanos tried to give anna his cross  but for her it was not sufficiently large enough for all bystanders to witness the oath  she also demanded that the cross be personally sent by botaneiates as a vow of his good faith  he obliged  sending a complete assurance for the family with his own cross  at the emperor s further insistence  and for their own protection  they took refuge at the convent of petrion  where they were eventually joined by maria of bulgaria  mother of irene doukaina  botaneiates allowed them to be treated as refugees rather than as guests  they were allowed to have family members bring in their own food and were on good terms with the guards from whom they learned the latest news  anna was highly successful in three important aspects of the revolt  she bought time for her sons to steal imperial horses from the stables and escape the city  she distracted the emperor  giving her sons time to gather and arm their troops  and she gave a false sense of security to botaneiates that there was no real treasonous coup against him  after bribing the western troops guarding the city  isaac and alexios komnenos entered the capital victoriously on april         

during this time  alexios was rumored to be the lover of empress maria of alania  the daughter of king bagrat  iv of georgia  who had been successively married to michael  vii doukas and his successor nikephoros  iii botaneiates  and who was renowned for her beauty  alexios arranged for maria to stay on the palace grounds  and it was thought that he was considering marrying her  however  his mother consolidated the doukas family connection by arranging the emperor s marriage to irene doukaina  granddaughter of the caesar john doukas  the uncle of michael  vii  who would not have supported alexios otherwise  as a measure intended to keep the support of the doukai  alexios restored constantine doukas  the young son of michael  vii and maria  as co emperor and a little later betrothed him to his own first born daughter anna  who moved into the mangana palace with her fianc   and his mother 

this situation changed drastically  however  when alexios  first son john  ii komnenos was born in       anna s engagement to constantine was dissolved  and she was moved to the main palace to live with her mother and grandmother  alexios became estranged from maria  who was stripped of her imperial title and retired to a monastery  and constantine doukas was deprived of his status as co emperor  nevertheless  he remained in good relations with the imperial family and succumbed to his weak constitution soon afterwards 

the nearly thirty seven year reign of alexios was full of struggle  at the outset he faced the formidable attack of the normans  led by robert guiscard and his son bohemund  who took dyrrhachium and corfu and laid siege to larissa in thessaly  see battle of dyrrhachium   alexios suffered several defeats before he was able to strike back with success  he enhanced his resistance by bribing the german king henry  iv with         gold pieces to attack the normans in italy  which forced the normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in            he also secured the alliance of henry  count of monte sant angelo  who controlled the gargano peninsula and dated his charters by alexios  reign  henry s allegiance would be the last example of byzantine political control on peninsular italy  the norman danger subsided with the death of guiscard in       and the byzantines recovered most of their losses 

alexios next had to deal with disturbances in thrace  where the heretical sects of the bogomils and the paulicians revolted and made common cause with the pechenegs from beyond the danube  paulician soldiers in imperial service likewise deserted during alexios  battles with the normans  as soon as the norman threat had passed  alexios set out to punish the rebels and deserters  confiscating their lands  this led to a further revolt near philippopolis  and the commander of the field army in the west  gregory pakourianos  was defeated and killed in the ensuing battle  in      the pechenegs raided into thrace  and alexios crossed into moesia to retaliate but failed to take dorostolon  silistra   during his retreat  the emperor was surrounded and worn down by the pechenegs  who forced him to sign a truce and to pay protection money  in      the pechenegs invaded thrace again  while tzachas  the brother in law of the sultan of rum  launched a fleet and attempted to arrange a joint siege of constantinople with the pechenegs  alexios overcame this crisis by entering into an alliance with a horde of        cumans  with whose help he crushed the pechenegs at levounion in thrace on    april      

this put an end to the pecheneg threat  but in      the cumans began to raid the imperial territories in the balkans  led by a pretender claiming to be constantine diogenes  a long dead son of the emperor romanos  iv  the cumans crossed the mountains and raided into eastern thrace until their leader was eliminated at adrianople  with the balkans more or less pacified  alexios could now turn his attention to asia minor  which had been almost completely overrun by the seljuq turks 

by the time alexios ascended the throne  the seljuqs had taken most of asia minor  alexios was able to secure much of the coastal regions by sending peasant soldiers to raid the seljuq camps  but these victories were unable to stop the turks altogether  as early as       alexios had taken reconciliatory measures towards the papacy  with the intention of seeking western support against the seljuqs  in      his ambassadors appeared before pope urban  ii at the council of piacenza  the help he sought from the west was simply some mercenary forces  not the immense hosts that arrived  to his consternation and embarrassment  after the pope preached the first crusade at the council of clermont later that same year  not quite ready to supply this number of people as they traversed his territories  the emperor saw his balkan possessions subjected to further pillage at the hands of his own allies  alexios dealt with the first disorganized group of crusaders  led by the preacher peter the hermit  by sending them on to asia minor  where they were massacred by the turks in      

the second and much more formidable host of crusaders gradually made its way to constantinople  led in sections by godfrey of bouillon  bohemond of taranto  raymond  iv of toulouse  and other important members of the western nobility  alexios used the opportunity to meet the crusader leaders separately as they arrived  extracting from them oaths of homage and the promise to turn over conquered lands to the byzantine empire  transferring each contingent into asia  alexios promised to supply them with provisions in return for their oaths of homage  the crusade was a notable success for byzantium  as alexios recovered a number of important cities and islands  the siege of nicaea by the crusaders forced the city to surrender to the emperor in       and the subsequent crusader victory at dorylaion allowed the byzantine forces to recover much of western asia minor  john doukas re established byzantine rule in chios  rhodes  smyrna  ephesus  sardis  and philadelphia in              this success is ascribed by alexios  daughter anna to his policy and diplomacy  but by the latin historians of the crusade to his treachery and deception  in       a byzantine fleet of ten ships was sent to assist the crusaders in capturing laodicea and other coastal towns as far as tripoli  the crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when the byzantine contingent under tatikios failed to help them during the siege of antioch  bohemund  who had set himself up as prince of antioch  briefly went to war with alexios in the balkans  but he was blockaded by the byzantine forces and agreed to become a vassal of alexios by the treaty of devol in      

in       though already terminally ill  alexios conducted a series of defensive operations in bythinia and mysia to defend his anatolian territories against the inroads of malik shah  the seljuq sultan of iconium  in      he moved onto the offensive and pushed his army deep into the turkish dominated anatolian plateau  where he defeated the seljuq sultan at the battle of philomelion 

during the last twenty years of his life alexios lost much of his popularity  the years were marked by persecution of the followers of the paulician and bogomil heresies   one of his last acts was to publicly burn at the stake basil  a bogomil leader  with whom he had engaged in a theological dispute  in spite of the success of the first crusade  alexios also had to repel numerous attempts on his territory by the seljuqs in             

alexios was for many years under the strong influence of an  eminence grise   his mother anna dalassene  a wise and immensely able politician whom  in a uniquely irregular fashion  he had crowned as  augusta  instead of the rightful claimant to the title  his wife irene doukaina  alexios was never happier than when taking part in military exercises and he assumed personal command of his troops whenever possible  as such  dalassene was the effective administrator of the empire during alexios  long absences in military campaigns  she was constantly at odds with her daughter in law and had assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter anna komnene 

alexios  last years were also troubled by anxieties over the succession  although he had crowned his son john  ii komnenos co emperor at the age of five in       his wife  irene doukaina wished to alter the succession in favor of their daughter anna and anna s husband  nikephoros bryennios the younger  bryennios had been made  kaisar   caesar  and received the newly created title of  panhypersebastos    honoured above all    and remained loyal to both alexios and john  nevertheless  the intrigues of irene and anna disturbed even alexios  dying hours 

apart from all of his external enemies  a host of rebels also sought to overthrow alexios from the imperial throne  thereby posing another major threat to his reign  due to the troubled times the empire was enduring  he had by far the greatest number of rebellions against him of all the byzantine emperors  these included 



under alexios the debased  solidus    tetarteron  and  histamenon   was discontinued and a gold coinage of higher fineness  generally              was established in       commonly called the  hyperpyron  at      grs  the  hyperpyron  was slightly smaller than the  solidus  

it was introduced along with the electrum  aspron trachy  worth a third of a  hyperpyron  and about     gold and     silver  the billon  aspron trachy  or  stamenon   valued at    to the  hyperpyron  and with    silver wash and the copper  tetarteron  and  noummion  worth    and    to the billon  aspron trachy  

alexios  reform of the byzantine monetary system was an important basis for the financial recovery and therefore supported the so called komnenian restoration  as the new coinage restored financial confidence 

alexios  i had overcome a dangerous crisis and stabilized the byzantine empire  inaugurating a century of imperial prosperity and success  he had also profoundly altered the nature of the byzantine government  by seeking close alliances with powerful noble families  alexios put an end to the tradition of imperial exclusivity and co opted most of the nobility into his extended family and  through it  his government  those who did not become part of this extended family were deprived of power and prestige  this measure  which was intended to diminish opposition  was paralleled by the introduction of new courtly dignities  like that of  panhypersebastos  given to nikephoros bryennios  or that of  sebastokrator  given to the emperor s brother isaac komnenos  although this policy met with initial success  it gradually undermined the relative effectiveness of imperial bureaucracy by placing family connections over merit  alexios  policy of integration of the nobility bore the fruit of continuity  every byzantine emperor who reigned after alexios  i komnenos was related to him by either descent or marriage 

by his marriage with irene doukaina  alexios  i had the following children

he won his first lenaean victory in the    s bc  most likely  where he was sixth after eubulus  and fourth after antiphanes  while being a middle comic poet  alexis was contemporary with several leading figures of new comedy  such as philippides  philemon  diphilus  and even menander  there is also some evidence that  during his old age  he wrote plays in the style of new comedy 

plutarch says that he lived to the age of     and   months  and that he died on the stage while being crowned victor  he was certainly alive after     bc  for aeschines mentions him as alive in that year  he was also living at least as late as     bc  from which his birth date is calculated  according to the  suda  he wrote     comedies  of which only fragments including some     titles survive  his plays include  meropis    ankylion    olympiodoros    parasitos   exhibited in     bc  in which he ridiculed plato    agonis   in which he ridiculed misgolas   and the  adelphoi  and the  stratiotes   in which he satirized demosthenes  and acted shortly after     bc

only fragments have survived from any of alexis s plays     about     in all  totaling about       lines  they attest to the author s wit and refinement  which athenaeus praises  the surviving fragments also show that alexis invented a great many words  mostly compound words  that he used normal words in an unusual way  and made strange and unusual forms of common words  the main sources of the fragments of alexis are stobaeus and athenaeus 

the following     titles of alexis s plays have been preserved

by      alexios had returned to the court of his younger brother  from whom he received the elevated title of  sebastokrat  r   in march      while isaac ii was away hunting in thrace  alexios was acclaimed as emperor by the troops with the covert support of alexios  wife euphrosyne doukaina kamatera  alexios captured isaac at stagira in macedonia  put out his eyes  and thenceforth kept him a close prisoner  despite having previously been redeemed by alexios from captivity at antioch and showered with honours 

to compensate for this crime and to solidify his position as emperor  alexios had to scatter money so lavishly as to empty his treasury  and to allow such licence to the officers of the army as to leave the empire practically defenceless  these actions inevitably led to the financial ruin of the state  at christmas       holy roman emperor henry vi attempted to force alexios to pay him a tribute of       pounds  later negotiated down to       pounds  of gold or face invasion  alexios gathered the money by plundering imperial tombs at the church of the holy apostles and taxing the people heavily  though henry s death in september      meant the gold was never dispatched  the able and forceful empress euphrosyne tried in vain to sustain his credit and his court  vatatzes  the favourite instrument in her attempts at reform  was assassinated by the emperor s orders 

in the east the empire was overrun by the seljuk turks  from the north  the kingdom of hungary and the rebellious bulgarians and vlachs descended unchecked to ravage the balkan provinces of the empire  sometimes penetrating as far as greece  while alexios squandered the public treasure on his palaces and gardens and attempted to deal with the crisis through diplomatic means  the emperor s attempts to bolster the empire s defences by special concessions to pronoiars  notables  in the frontier zone backfired  as the latter increased their regional autonomy  byzantine authority survived  but in a much weakened state 

soon alexios was threatened by a new and more formidable danger  in       soldiers assembled at venice to launch the fourth crusade  alexios iv angelos  the son of the deposed isaac ii  had recently escaped from constantinople and now appealed for support to the crusaders  promising to end the schism of east and west  to pay for their transport  and to provide military support if they would help him depose his uncle and ascend to his father s throne 

the crusaders  whose objective had been egypt  were persuaded to set their course for constantinople  arriving there in june       proclaiming alexios iv as emperor  and inviting the populace of the capital to depose his uncle  alexios iii took no effective measures to resist  and his attempts to bribe the crusaders failed  his son in law  theodore laskaris  who was the only one to attempt anything significant  was defeated at scutari  and the siege of constantinople began  unfortunately for the city  misgovernment by alexios iii had left the byzantine navy with only    worm eaten hulks by the time the crusaders arrived 

in july  the crusaders  led by the aged doge enrico dandolo  scaled the walls and took control of a major section of the city  in the ensuing fighting  the crusaders set the city on fire  ultimately leaving        people homeless  on    july alexios iii finally took action and led    divisions from the st  romanus gate  vastly outnumbering the crusaders  his courage failed  however  and the byzantine army returned to the city without a fight  his courtiers demanded action  and alexios iii promised to fight  instead  that night  july         alexios iii hid in the palace  and finally  with one of his daughters  eirene  and as much treasure        pounds of gold  as he could collect  got into a boat and escaped to debeltos in thrace  leaving his wife and his other daughters behind  isaac ii  drawn from his prison and robed once more in the imperial purple  received his son  alexios iv  in state 

alexios iii attempted to organize resistance to the new regime from adrianople and then mosynopolis  where he was joined by the later usurper alexios v doukas  mourtzouphlos  in april       after the definitive fall of constantinople to the crusaders and the establishment of the latin empire  at first alexios iii received alexios v well  even allowing him to marry his daughter eudokia angelina  later alexios v was blinded and deserted by his father in law  who fled from the crusaders into thessaly  here alexios iii eventually surrendered  with euphrosyne  to marquis boniface of montferrat  who was establishing himself as ruler of the kingdom of thessalonica 

alexios iii attempted to escape boniface s  protection  in       seeking shelter with michael i komnenos doukas  the ruler of epirus  captured by boniface  alexios and his retinue were sent to montferrat before being brought back to thessalonica in   at that point the deposed emperor was ransomed by michael i  who sent him to asia minor  where alexios  son in law theodore laskaris   now emperor of nicaea   was holding his own against the latins  here alexios conspired against his son in law after the latter refused to recognize alexios  authority  receiving the support of kaykhusraw i  the sultan of r  m  in the battle of antioch on the meander in       the sultan was defeated and killed  and alexios was captured by theodore laskaris  alexios was then confined to a monastery at nicaea  where he died later in      

by his marriage to euphrosyne doukaina kamatera  alexios had three daughters 






alexios v doukas

alexios v doukas      december        in latinised spelling alexius v ducas  was byzantine emperor from   february to    april       during the second and final siege of constantinople by the participants of the fourth crusade  his family name was doukas  but he was also known by the nickname mourtzouphlos or murtzuphlus     referring to either bushy  overhanging eyebrows or a sullen  gloomy character  he achieved power through a palace coup  killing his predecessors in the process  though he made vigorous attempts to defend constantinople from the crusader army  his military efforts proved ineffective  his actions won the support of the mass of the populace  but he alienated the elite of the city  following the fall  sack  and occupation of the city  alexios v was blinded by another ex emperor and later executed by the new latin regime  he was the last byzantine emperor to rule in constantinople until the byzantine recapture of constantinople in      

though possessing the name of a leading byzantine aristocratic family  there is very little definitely known concerning the ancestry of alexios doukas mourtzouphlos  the noble doukas clan were not the only doukai  as the surname was also employed by many families of humble origins  it has been claimed that alexios doukas was a great great grandson of the emperor alexios i komnenos    in the female line  cognatic descent   this is not improbable  as all other byzantine emperors  and the majority of attempted usurpers  of the period had a connection with the former imperial house of the komnenoi  either by descent or marriage  a more precise theory has been proposed  that he was the son of an isaac doukas  and was the second cousin of alexios iv angelos     a letter sent to pope innocent iii  stated that alexios doukas mourtzouphlos was  a blood relation  of alexios iv angelos 

the contemporary historian niketas choniates was dismissed from office as logothete of the  sekreta  by mourtzouphlos  his assessment of the emperor s character might therefore be biased  however  choniates allows that he was extremely clever by nature  though arrogant in his manner and lecherous 

the participation of alexios doukas mourtzouphlos in the attempted overthrow of alexios iii angelos    by john komnenos the fat in      had led to his imprisonment  mourtzouphlos was probably imprisoned from      until the restoration to the throne of isaac ii angelos     the brother and predecessor of alexios iii  isaac ii  along with his son alexios iv angelos  were restored to the throne through the intervention of the leaders of the fourth crusade in july       on release  mourtzouphlos was invested with the court position of  protovestiarios   head of the imperial finances   he had been married twice but was allegedly the lover of eudokia angelina  a daughter of alexios iii 

by the beginning of       isaac ii and alexios iv had inspired little confidence among the people of constantinople with their efforts to protect the city from the latin crusaders and their venetian allies  and the citizens were becoming restless  the crusaders were also losing patience with the emperors  they rioted and set fires in the city when the money and aid promised by alexios iv was not forthcoming  the fires affected about a sixth of the area of constantinople and may have made up to a third of the population homeless  the dislocation and desperation of those affected eventually sapped the will of the people to resist the crusaders  alexios doukas mourtzouphlos emerged as a leader of the anti latin movement in the city  he won the approval of the populace by his valour in leading an attack on the latins at  trypetos lithos   in this clash his mount stumbled and he would have been killed or captured had a band of youthful archers from the city not defended him  mourtzouphlos exploited the hatred of the people for the latins to serve his personal ambition 

the citizens of constantinople rebelled in late january       and in the chaos an otherwise obscure nobleman named nicholas kanabos was acclaimed emperor  though he was unwilling to accept the crown  the two co emperors barricaded themselves in the palace of blachernae and entrusted mourtzouphlos with a mission to seek help from the crusaders  or at least they informed him of their intentions  instead of contacting the crusaders  mourtzouphlos  on the night of         january       used his access to the palace to bribe the  ax bearers   the varangian guard   and with their backing arrest the emperors  choniates states that mourtzouphlos  when bribing the guards  had the help of a eunuch with access to the imperial treasury  the support of the varangians seems to have been of major importance in the success of the coup  though mourtzouphlos also had help from his relations and associates  the young alexios iv was eventually strangled in prison  while his father isaac  both enfeebled and blind  died at around the time of the coup  his death variously attributed to fright  sorrow  or mistreatment  kanabos  after refusing to take office under alexios v  took sanctuary in the hagia sophia  but was forcibly removed and killed on the steps of the cathedral 

the timing of the deaths of the deposed emperors and of kanabos  and their relation to the coronation of alexios v are problematic  alexios v appears to have been acclaimed emperor as early as the night he moved against the angeloi co emperors  hendrickx and matzukis suggest that alexios v assumed the imperial insignia immediately  but was crowned later  possibly on   february  finding the treasury empty  the new emperor confiscated money from the aristocracy and high officials to be put to public use  these actions endeared alexios v to the citizens  but alienated his relations and other prominent supporters  once in firm control  alexios v closed the gates of the city to the crusaders and strengthened the fortifications  sword in hand  he was active in leading attacks on sorties made by the crusaders in search of supplies  on   february  henry of flanders led a part of the crusader army to filea  or phileas   in order to obtain food supplies  as he returned towards constantinople alexios v attacked his rearguard  the byzantines were defeated and the imperial standard and an important icon of the virgin  the  panagia nikopoios   were captured  the byzantines lost some of their best soldiers in the clash  and alexios v was lucky to escape alive  at about this time alexios v attempted to destroy the crusader fleet with fire ships  but to little effect  

the loss of the icon  traditionally seen as a physical embodiment of divine protection for the city  was a severe psychological blow  its possession by the crusaders convinced many of the population of constantinople that the victory of the westerners was now divinely sanctioned  as a punishment for the sins of the byzantines 

on   february alexios v met the doge of venice  enrico dandolo  for peace talks  the conditions demanded by the venetian  however  were too harsh for the byzantines to consider  choniates states that the meeting was brought to a close by an sudden attack by crusader cavalry on alexios v and his entourage  the emperor narrowly escaping capture  according to choniates  alexios iv was killed the same day  the insistence by the crusaders that he be restored to the throne may have precipitated his death  when news of the death of alexios iv reached the crusaders  relations between them and alexios v deteriorated further  the forcible expulsion of all latins resident in constantinople in march seems to have been the tipping point which led the crusaders to begin actively negotiating amongst themselves regarding the partition of the byzantine empire  they also began to prepare for their final assault on the city  which took place the following month 

the defenders of constantinople held out against a crusader assault on   april  the crusaders  second attack three days later  however  proved too strong to repel  breaking through the walls near the petria gate  the crusaders entered the city and looted the blachernae palace  alexios v attempted to rally the people to the defence of the city  but with no success  alexios v then boarded a fishing boat and fled the city towards thrace on the night of    april       accompanied by eudokia angelina and her mother euphrosyne doukaina kamatera  in the hagia sophia constantine laskaris was acclaimed as emperor  but being unable to persuade the varangians to continue the fight  in the early hours of    april he also fled  leaving constantinople under crusader control 

alexios v and his companions eventually reached mosynopolis  which had been occupied by the deposed emperor alexios iii angelos and his followers  at first they were well received  with alexios v marrying eudokia angelina  later  however  alexios iii arranged for his new son in law to be made captive and blinded  thereby rendering him ineligible for the imperial throne  having been abandoned by both his supporters and his father in law  alexios v was captured near mosynopolis  or possibly in anatolia  by the advancing latins under thierry de loos in november       on his return to constantinople as a prisoner  alexios v was tried for treason against alexios iv  in his trial the blind ex emperor argued that it was alexios iv who had committed treason to his country  through his intention to invite the crusaders to enter constantinople in force  on being condemned  he was executed by novel means  he was thrown to his death from the top of the column of theodosius  the new  alien  latin regime of conquerors in constantinople may have viewed the public trial and execution of the man who murdered the last  legitimate emperor  as a way to cast an aura of legitimacy on themselves  alexios v was the last byzantine emperor to reign in constantinople before the establishment of the latin empire  which controlled the city for the next    years  until it was recovered by the nicaean emperor michael viii palaiologos in      







alexei petrovich  tsarevich of russia

alexei petrovich romanov     february            july       was a russian tsarevich  he was born in moscow  the son of tsar peter i and his first wife  eudoxia lopukhina  alexei despised his father and repeatedly thwarted peter s plans to raise him as successor to the throne  his brief defection to austria scandalized the russian government  leading to harsh repressions against alexei and his associates  alexei died after interrogation under torture  and his son peter alexeyevich became the new heir apparent 

the young alexei was brought up by his mother  who fostered an atmosphere of disdain towards his father  the tsar  alexei s relations with his father suffered from the hatred between his father and his mother  as it was very difficult for him to feel affection for his mother s worst persecutor  from the ages of   to    alexei was educated by his tutor vyazemsky  but after the removal of his mother by peter the great to the suzdal intercession convent  alexei was confined to the care of educated foreigners  who taught him history  geography  mathematics and french 

in       alexei was ordered to follow the army to the field as a private in a bombardier regiment  in       he was present at the capture of narva  at this period  the preceptors of the tsarevich had the highest opinion of his ability  alexei had strong leanings towards archaeology and ecclesiology  however  peter had wished his son and heir to dedicate himself to the service of new russia  and demanded from him unceasing labour in order to maintain russia s new wealth and power  painful relations between father and son  quite apart from the prior personal antipathies  were therefore inevitable  it was an additional misfortune for alexei that his father should have been too busy to attend to him just as he was growing up from boyhood to manhood  he was left in the hands of reactionary boyars and priests  who encouraged him to hate his father and wish for the death of the tsar 
in      peter sent alexei to smolensk to collect provender and recruits  and after that to moscow to fortify it against charles xii of sweden  at the end of       alexei went to dresden for one year  there  he finished lessons in french  german  mathematics and fortification  after his education  alexei married princess charlotte of brunswick wolfenb  ttel  whose family was connected by marriage to many of the great families of europe  i e   charlotte s sister elizabeth was married to holy roman emperor charles vi  ruler of the habsburg monarchy   he met with princess charlotte  both were pleased with each other and the marriage went forward  in theory  alexei could have refused the marriage  and he had been encouraged by his father to at least meet his intended   why haven t you written to tell me what you thought about her   wrote peter  in a tone that can only be guessed  in a letter dated    august      

the marriage contract was signed in september  the wedding was celebrated at torgau  germany  on    october       one of the terms of the marriage contract agreed to by alexei was that while any forthcoming children were to be raised in the orthodox faith  charlotte herself was allowed to retain her protestant faith  an agreement opposed by alexei s followers 

as for the marriage itself  the first   months went well but quickly became a failure within   months  alexis was drunk constantly and alexei pronounced his bride  pock marked  and  too thin   he insisted on separate apartments and ignored her in public 

three weeks later  the bridegroom was hurried away by his father to toru   to superintend the provisioning of the russian troops in poland  for the next twelve months alexei was kept constantly on the move  his wife joined him at toru   in december  but in april      a peremptory ukase ordered him off to the army in pomerania  and in the autumn of the same year he was forced to accompany his father on a tour of inspection through finland  

he had two children with charlotte 

peter alexeyevich would succeed as the emperor peter ii in       with his death in       the direct male line of the house of romanov became extinct 

after the birth of natalia in       alexei brought his long time finnish serf mistress afrosinia to live in the palace  some historians speculate that it was his conservative powerbase s disapproval of his foreign  non orthodox bride  more so than her appearance  that caused alexei to spurn charlotte  another influence was alexander kikin  a high placed official who had fallen out with the tsar and had been deprived of his estates 

immediately on his return from finland  alexei was dispatched by his father to staraya russa and lake ladoga to see to the building of new ships  this was the last commission entrusted to him  since peter had not been satisfied with his son s performance and his lack of enthusiasm  nevertheless  peter made one last effort to  reclaim  his son  on    october       charlotte died  after giving birth to a son  the grand duke peter  the future emperor peter ii  on the day of the funeral  peter sent alexei a stern letter  urging him to take interest in the affairs of the state  peter threatened to cut him off if he did not acquiesce in his father s plans  alexei wrote a pitiful reply to his father  offering to renounce the succession in favour of his infant son peter  peter would agree but on the condition that alexei remove himself as a dynastic threat and become a monk 

while alexei was pondering his options  on    august      peter wrote to alexei from abroad  urging him  if he desired to remain tsarevich  to join him and the army without delay  rather than face this ordeal  alexei fled to vienna and placed himself under the protection of his brother in law  the emperor charles vi  who sent him for safety first to the tirolean fortress of ehrenberg  near reutte   and finally to the castle of sant elmo at naples  he was accompanied throughout his journey by afrosinia  that the emperor sincerely sympathized with alexei  and suspected peter of harbouring murderous designs against his son  is plain from his confidential letter to george i of great britain  whom he consulted on this delicate affair  peter felt insulted  the flight of the tsarevich to a foreign potentate was a reproach and a scandal  and he had to be recovered and brought back to russia at all costs  this difficult task was accomplished by count peter tolstoi  the most subtle and unscrupulous of peter s servants 

alexei would only consent to return on his father solemnly swearing  that if he came back he should not be punished in the least  but cherished as a son and allowed to live quietly on his estates and marry afrosinia 

on    january       the tsarevich reached moscow  peter had already determined to institute a searching inquisition in order to get at the bottom of the mystery of the flight  on    february a  confession  was extorted from alexei which implicated most of his friends  and he then publicly renounced the succession to the throne in favour of the baby grand duke peter petrovich  

a brutal reign of terror ensued  in the course of which the ex tsaritsa eudoxia was dragged from her monastery and publicly tried for alleged adultery  while all who had in any way befriended alexei were impaled or broken on the wheel while having their flesh torn with red hot pincers on their bare backs or bare feet slowly roasted over burning coals  and were otherwise lingeringly done to death  alexei s servants were beheaded or had their tongues cut out  all this was done to terrorize the reactionaries and isolate the tsarevich 

in april      fresh confessions were extorted from  and in regard to  alexei  this included the words of afrosinia  who had turned state s evidence   i shall bring back the old people     alexei is reported to have told her 
    and choose myself new ones according to my will 
when i become sovereign i shall live in moscow and leave saint petersburg simply as any other town  i won t launch any ships  i shall maintain troops only for defense  and won t make war on anyone  i shall be content with the old domains  in winter i shall live in moscow  and in summer in iaroslavl  

despite this and other hearsay evidence  there were no facts to go upon  the worst that could be brought against him was that he had wished his father s death  in the eyes of peter  his son was now a self convicted and most dangerous traitor  whose life was forfeit  but there was no getting over the fact that his father had sworn to pardon him and let him live in peace if he returned to russia  the whole matter was solemnly submitted to a grand council of prelates  senators  ministers and other dignitaries on    june       the clergy  for their part  declared the tsarevich alexei 

    had placed his confidence in those who loved the ancient customs  and that he had become acquainted with them by the discourses they held  wherein they had constantly praised the ancient manners  and spoke with distaste of the novelties his father had introduced  

declaring this to be a civil rather than an ecclesiastical matter  the clergy left the matter to the tsar s own decision 

at noon on    june  the temporal dignitaries   the     members of both the senate and magistrates that comprised the court   declared alexei guilty and sentenced him to death  but the examination by torture continued  so desperate was peter to uncover any possible collusion 

on    june  the weak and ailing tsarevich received twenty five strokes with the knout  and then  on the   th  he was subject to fifteen more  on    june  alexei died in the peter and paul fortress in saint petersburg  two days after the senate had condemned him to death for conspiring rebellion against his father  and for hoping for the cooperation of the common people and the armed intervention of his brother in law  the emperor 






andrew jackson

andrew jackson  march               june          was an american soldier and statesman who served as the seventh president of the united states from      to       before being elected to the presidency  jackson gained fame as a general in the united states army and served in both houses of congress  as president  jackson sought to advance the rights of the  common man  against a  corrupt aristocracy  and to preserve the union 

born in the colonial carolinas to a scotch irish family in the decade before the american revolutionary war  jackson became a frontier lawyer and married rachel donelson robards  he served briefly in the u s  house of representatives and the u s  senate representing tennessee  after resigning  he served as a justice on the tennessee supreme court from      until       jackson purchased a property later known as the hermitage  and became a wealthy  slaveowning planter  in       he was appointed colonel of the tennessee militia and was elected its commander the following year  he led troops during the creek war of              winning the battle of horseshoe bend  the subsequent treaty of fort jackson required the creek surrender of vast lands in present day alabama and georgia  in the concurrent war against the british  jackson s victory in      at the battle of new orleans made him a national hero  jackson then led u s  forces in the first seminole war  which led to the annexation of florida from spain  jackson briefly served as florida s first territorial governor before returning to the senate  he ran for president in       winning a plurality of the popular and electoral vote  as no candidate won an electoral majority  the house of representatives elected john quincy adams in a contingent election  in reaction to the alleged  corrupt bargain  between adams and henry clay and the ambitious agenda of president adams  jackson s supporters founded the democratic party 

jackson ran again in       defeating adams in a landslide  jackson faced the threat of secession by south carolina over what opponents called the  tariff of abominations   the crisis was defused when the tariff was amended  and jackson threatened the use of military force if south carolina attempted to secede  in congress  henry clay led the effort to reauthorize the second bank of the united states  jackson  regarding the bank as a corrupt institution  vetoed the renewal of its charter  after a lengthy struggle  jackson and his allies thoroughly dismantled the bank  in       jackson became the only president to completely pay off the national debt  fulfilling a longtime goal  his presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the party  spoils system  in american politics  in       jackson signed the indian removal act  which forcibly relocated most members of the native american tribes in the south to indian territory  in foreign affairs  jackson s administration concluded a  most favored nation  treaty with great britain  settled claims of damages against france from the napoleonic wars  and recognized the republic of texas  in january       he survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president 

in his retirement  jackson remained active in democratic party politics  supporting the presidencies of martin van buren and james k  polk  though fearful of its effects on the slavery debate  jackson advocated the annexation of texas  which was accomplished shortly before his death  jackson has been widely revered in the united states as an advocate for democracy and the common man  many of his actions  such as those during the bank war  proved divisive  garnering both fervent support and strong opposition from many in the country  his reputation has suffered since the     s  largely due to his role in indian removal  surveys of historians and scholars have ranked jackson favorably among united states presidents 

andrew jackson was born on march           in the waxhaws region of the carolinas  his parents were scots irish colonists andrew and elizabeth hutchinson jackson  presbyterians who had emigrated from present day northern ireland two years earlier  jackson s father was born in carrickfergus  county antrim  in current day northern ireland  around       jackson s parents lived in the village of boneybefore  also in county antrim  his paternal family line originated in killingswold grove  yorkshire  england 

when they immigrated to north america in       jackson s parents probably landed in philadelphia  most likely they traveled overland through the appalachian mountains to the scots irish community in the waxhaws  straddling the border between north and south carolina  they brought two children from ireland  hugh  born       and robert  born        jackson s father died in a logging accident while clearing land in february      at the age of     three weeks before his son andrew was born  jackson  his mother  and his brothers lived with jackson s aunt and uncle in the waxhaws region  and jackson received schooling from two nearby priests 

jackson s exact birthplace is unclear because of a lack of knowledge of his mother s actions immediately following her husband s funeral  the area was so remote that the border between north and south carolina had not been officially surveyed  in      jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born on the plantation of his uncle james crawford in lancaster county  south carolina  jackson may have claimed to be a south carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the tariff of       which he opposed  in the mid     s  second hand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncle s home in north carolina  as a young boy  jackson was easily offended and was considered something of a bully  he was  however  said to have taken a group of younger and weaker boys under his wing and been very kind to them 

during the revolutionary war  jackson s eldest brother  hugh  died from heat exhaustion after the battle of stono ferry on june           anti british sentiment intensified following the brutal waxhaws massacre on may           jackson s mother encouraged him and his elder brother robert to attend the local militia drills  soon  they began to help the militia as couriers  they served under colonel william richardson davie at the battle of hanging rock on august    andrew and robert were captured by the british in      while staying at the home of the crawford family  when andrew refused to clean the boots of a british officer  the officer slashed at the youth with a sword  leaving him with scars on his left hand and head  as well as an intense hatred for the british  robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck with the sword  the two brothers were held as prisoners  contracted smallpox  and nearly starved to death in captivity 

later that year  their mother elizabeth secured the brothers  release  she then began to walk both boys back to their home in the waxhaws  a distance of some    miles      km   both were in very poor health  robert  who was far worse  rode on the only horse that they had  while andrew walked behind them  in the final two hours of the journey  a torrential downpour began which worsened the effects of the smallpox  within two days of arriving back home  robert was dead and andrew in mortal danger  after nursing andrew back to health  elizabeth volunteered to nurse american prisoners of war on board two british ships in the charleston harbor  where there had been an outbreak of cholera  in november  she died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave  andrew became an orphan at age     he blamed the british personally for the loss of his brothers and mother 

after the revolutionary war  jackson received a sporadic education in a local waxhaw school  on bad terms with much of his extended family  he boarded with several different people  in       he worked for a time as a saddle maker  and eventually taught school  he apparently prospered in neither profession  in       he left the waxhaws region for salisbury  north carolina  where he studied law under attorney spruce macay  with the help of various lawyers  he was able to learn enough to qualify for the bar  in september       jackson was admitted to the north carolina bar  shortly thereafter  a friend helped him get appointed to a vacant prosecutor position in the western district of north carolina  which would later become the state of tennessee  during his travel west  jackson bought his first slave and in       having been offended by fellow lawyer waightstill avery  fought his first duel  the duel ended with both men firing into the air  having made a secret agreement to do so before the engagement 

jackson moved to the small frontier town of nashville in       where he lived as a boarder with rachel stockly donelson  the widow of john donelson  here jackson became acquainted with their daughter  rachel donelson robards  the younger rachel was in an unhappy marriage with captain lewis robards  he was subject to fits of jealous rage  the two were separated in       according to jackson  he married rachel after hearing that robards had obtained a divorce  her divorce had not been made final  making rachel s marriage to jackson bigamous and therefore invalid  after the divorce was officially completed  rachel and jackson remarried in       to complicate matters further  evidence shows that rachel had been living with jackson and referred to herself as mrs  jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made  it was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially  as long as they were recognized by the community 

in       jackson formed a partnership with fellow lawyer john overton  dealing in claims for land reserved by treaty for the cherokee and chickasaw  like many of their contemporaries  they dealt in such claims although the land was in indian country  most of the transactions involved grants made under the  land grab  act of      that briefly opened indian lands west of the appalachians within north carolina to claim by that state s residents  he was one of the three original investors who founded memphis  tennessee  in      

after moving to nashville  jackson became a protege of william blount  a friend of the donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the territory  jackson became attorney general in       and he won election as a delegate to the tennessee constitutional convention in       when tennessee achieved statehood that year  he was elected its only u s  representative  he was a member of the democratic republican party  the dominant party in tennessee  jackson soon became associated with the more radical  pro french and anti british wing  he strongly opposed the jay treaty and criticized george washington for allegedly removing republicans from public office  jackson joined several other republican congressmen in voting against a resolution of thanks for washington  a vote that would later haunt him when he sought the presidency  in       the state legislature elected him as u s  senator  jackson seldom participated in debate and found the job dissatisfying  he pronounced himself  disgusted with the administration  of president john adams and resigned the following year without explanation  upon returning home  with strong support from western tennessee  he was elected to serve as a judge of the tennessee supreme court at an annual salary of       jackson s service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making  jackson resigned the judgeship in       his official reason for resigning was ill health  he had been suffering financially from poor land ventures  and so it is also possible that he wanted to return full time to his business interests 

after arriving in tennessee  jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the tennessee militia  in       while serving on the tennessee supreme court  he declared his candidacy for major general  or commander  of the tennessee militia  a position voted on by the officers  at that time  most free men were members of the militia  the organizations  intended to be called up in case of conflict with europeans or indians  resembled large social clubs  jackson saw it as a way to advance his stature  with strong support from western tennessee  he tied with john sevier with seventeen votes  sevier was a popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor  the recognized leader of politics in eastern tennessee  on february    governor archibald roane broke the tie in jackson s favor  jackson had also presented roane with evidence of land fraud against sevier  subsequently  in       when sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship  roane released the evidence  sevier insulted jackson in public  and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter  despite the charges leveled against sevier  he defeated roane  and continued to serve as governor until      

in addition to his legal and political career  jackson prospered as planter  slave owner  and merchant  he built a home and the first general store in gallatin  tennessee  in       the next year  he acquired the hermitage  a plantation in davidson county  near nashville  he later added to the plantation  which eventually totaled   the primary crop was cotton  grown by slaves   jackson began with nine  owned as many as    by       and later up to      placing him among the planter elite  jackson also co owned with his son andrew jackson jr  the halcyon plantation in coahoma county  mississippi  which housed    slaves at the time of his death  throughout his lifetime jackson may have owned as many as     slaves 

men  women  and child slaves were owned by jackson on three sections of the hermitage plantation  slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in cabins made either of brick or logs  the size and quality of the hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times  to help slaves acquire food  jackson supplied them with guns  knives  and fishing equipment  at times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets  the hermitage plantation was a profit making enterprise  jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves  offenses were severe enough  at various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation  in one advertisement placed in the tennessee gazette in october       jackson offered  ten dollars extra  for every hundred lashes any person will give him  to the amount of three hundred  

the controversy surrounding his marriage to rachel remained a sore point for jackson  who deeply resented attacks on his wife s honor  by may       charles dickinson  who  like jackson  raced horses  had published an attack on jackson in the local newspaper  and it resulted in a written challenge from jackson to a duel  since dickinson was considered an expert shot  jackson determined it would be best to let dickinson turn and fire first  hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness  jackson would wait and take careful aim at dickinson  dickinson did fire first  hitting jackson in the chest  the bullet that struck jackson was so close to his heart that it could not be removed  under the rules of dueling  dickinson had to remain still as jackson took aim and shot and killed him  jackson s behavior in the duel outraged men in tennessee  who called it a brutal  cold blooded killing and saddled jackson with a reputation as a violent  vengeful man  he became a social outcast 

after the sevier affair and the duel  jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation  he chose to align himself with former vice president aaron burr  who after leaving office in       his political career over after the killing of alexander hamilton in a duel in       went on a tour of what was then the western united states  burr was extremely well received by the people of tennessee  and stayed for five days at the hermitage  burr s true intentions are not known with certainty  he seems to have been planning a military operation to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas  to many westerners like jackson  the promise seemed enticing  western american settlers had long held bitter feelings towards spain due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the spanish to keep indians living on their lands from raiding american settlements  and by spain s disinterest in returning fugitive slaves  on october          jackson addressed the tennessee militia  declaring that the men should be  at a moment s warning ready to march   on the same day  he wrote to james winchester  proclaiming that the united states  can conquer not only the floridas  at that time there was an east florida and a west florida    but all spanish north america   he continued 

jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition  however  on november     he learned from a military captain that burr s plans apparently included seizure of new orleans  then part of the louisiana territory of the united states  and incorporating it  along with lands won from the spanish  into a new empire  he was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of brigadier general james wilkinson  whom he deeply disliked  in the plan  jackson acted cautiously at first  but wrote letters to public officials  including president thomas jefferson  vaguely warning them about the scheme  in december  jefferson  a political opponent of burr  issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the west and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators  jackson  safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail  organized the militia  burr was soon captured  and the men were sent home  jackson traveled to richmond  virginia  to testify on burr s behalf in trial  the defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand  fearing his remarks were too provocative  burr was acquitted of treason  despite jefferson s efforts to have him convicted  jackson endorsed james monroe for president in      against james madison  the latter was part of the jeffersonian wing of the democratic republican party  jackson lived relatively quietly at the hermitage in the years after the burr trial  eventually accumulating     acres of land 

leading up to       the united states found itself increasingly drawn into international conflict  formal hostilities with spain or france never materialized  but tensions with britain increased for a number of reasons  among these was the desire of many americans for more land  particularly british canada and florida  the latter still controlled by spain  britain s european ally  on june           congress officially declared war on the united kingdom of great britain and ireland  beginning the war of       jackson responded enthusiastically  sending a letter to washington offering       volunteers  however  the men were not called up for many months  biographer robert v  remini claims that jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the madison administration for his support of burr and monroe  meanwhile  the united states military repeatedly suffered devastating defeats on the battlefield 

on january           jackson led an army of       volunteers to new orleans to defend the region against british and native american attacks  he had been instructed to serve under general wilkinson  who commanded federal forces in new orleans  lacking adequate provisions  wilkinson ordered jackson to halt in natchez  then part of the mississippi territory  and await further orders  jackson reluctantly obeyed  the newly appointed secretary of war  john armstrong jr   sent a letter to jackson dated february   ordering him to dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to wilkinson  in reply to armstrong on march     jackson defended the character and readiness of his men  and promised to turn over his supplies  he also promised  instead of dismissing the troops without provisions in natchez  to march them back to nashville  the march was filled with agony  many of the men had fallen ill  jackson and his officers turned over their horses to the sick  he paid for provisions for the men out of his own pocket  the soldiers began referring to their commander as  hickory  because of his toughness  and jackson became known as  old hickory   the army arrived in nashville within about a month  jackson s actions earned him respect and praise from the people of tennessee  jackson faced financial ruin  until his former aide de camp thomas benton persuaded secretary armstrong to order the army to pay the expenses jackson had incurred  on june     jackson served as a second in a duel on behalf of his junior officer william carroll against jesse benton  the brother of thomas  in september  jackson and his top cavalry officer  brigadier general john coffee  were involved in a street brawl with the benton brothers  jackson was severely wounded by jesse with a gunshot to the shoulder 

on august     a group of muscogee  also known as creek indians  called the red sticks  so named for the color of their war paint  perpetrated the fort mims massacre  during the massacre  hundreds of white american settlers and non red stick creeks were slaughtered  the red sticks  led by chiefs red eagle and peter mcqueen  had broken away from the rest of the creek confederacy  which wanted peace with the united states  they were allied with tecumseh  a shawnee chief who had launched tecumseh s war against the united states  and who was fighting alongside the british  the resulting conflict became known as the creek war 
jackson  with       men  was ordered to crush the hostile indians  on october     he set out on the expedition  his arm still in a sling from fighting the bentons  jackson established fort strother as a supply base  on november    coffee defeated a band of red sticks at the battle of tallushatchee  coming to the relief of friendly creeks besieged by red sticks  jackson won another decisive victory at the battle of talladega  in the winter  jackson  encamped at fort strother  faced a severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions  he sent coffee with the cavalry  which abandoned him  back to tennessee to secure more enlistments  jackson decided to combine his force with that of the georgia militia  and marched to meet the georgia troops  from january                while on their way  the tennessee militia and allied muscogee were attacked by the red sticks at the battles of emuckfaw and enotachopo creek  jackson s troops repelled the attackers  but outnumbered  were forced to withdraw to fort strother  jackson  now with over       troops  marched most of his army south to confront the red sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the tallapoosa river  on march     enjoying an advantage of more than   to    he engaged them at the battle of horseshoe bend  an initial artillery barrage did little damage to the well constructed fort  a subsequent infantry charge  in addition to an assault by coffee s cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly creeks  overwhelmed the red sticks 

the campaign ended three weeks later with red eagle s surrender  although some red sticks such as mcqueen fled to east florida  on june    jackson accepted a commission as brigadier general in the united states army  and    days later became a major general  in command of the seventh military division  subsequently  jackson  with madison s approval  imposed the treaty of fort jackson  the treaty required the muscogee  including those who had not joined the red sticks  to surrender    million acres            ha  of land to the united states  most of the creeks bitterly acquiesced  though in ill health from dysentery  jackson turned his attention to defeating spanish and british forces  jackson accused the spanish of arming the red sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing british soldiers into the floridas  the first charge was true  while the second ignored the fact that it was jackson s threats to invade florida which had caused them to seek british protection  in the november   battle of pensacola  jackson defeated british and spanish forces in a short skirmish  the spanish surrendered and the british fled  weeks later  he learned that the british were planning an attack on new orleans  which sat on the mouth of the mississippi river and held immense strategic and commercial value  jackson abandoned pensacola to the spanish  placed a force in mobile  alabama to guard against a possible invasion there  and rushed the rest of his force west to defend the city 

the creeks coined their own name for jackson   jacksa chula harjo  or  jackson  old and fierce  

after arriving in new orleans on december          jackson instituted martial law in the city  as he worried about the loyalty of the city s creole and spanish inhabitants  at the same time  he formed an alliance with jean lafitte s smugglers  and formed military units consisting of african americans and muscogees  in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city  jackson received some criticism for paying white and non white volunteers the same salary  these forces  along with u s  army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states  joined with jackson s force in defending new orleans  the approaching british force  led by admiral alexander cochrane and later general edward pakenham  consisted of over        soldiers  many of whom had served in the napoleonic wars  jackson only had about       men  most of whom were inexperienced and poorly trained 
the british arrived on the east bank of the mississippi river on the morning of december     that evening  jackson attacked the british and temporarily drove them back  on january          the british launched a major frontal assault against jackson s defenses  an initial artillery barrage by the british did little damage to the well constructed american defenses  once the morning fog had cleared  the british launched a frontal assault  and their troops made easy targets for the americans protected by their parapets  despite managing to temporarily drive back the american right flank  the overall attack ended in disaster  for the battle on january    jackson admitted to only    total casualties  of these     men were killed     wounded  and    missing or captured  the british admitted       casualties  of these      men were killed  including pakenham         wounded  and     missing or captured  after the battle  the british retreated from the area  and open hostilities ended shortly thereafter when word spread that the treaty of ghent had been signed in europe that december  coming in the waning days of the war  jackson s victory made him a national hero  as the country celebrated the end of what many called the  second american revolution  against the british  by a congressional resolution on february           jackson was given the thanks of congress and awarded a congressional gold medal 

alexis de tocqueville   underwhelmed  by jackson according to a      commentator  later wrote in  democracy in america  that jackson  was raised to the presidency  and has been maintained there  solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained  twenty years ago  under the walls of new orleans   some have claimed that  because the war was already ended by the preliminary signing of the treaty of ghent  jackson s victory at new orleans was without importance aside from making him a celebrated figure  however  the spanish  who had sold the louisiana territory to france  disputed france s right to sell it to the united states through the louisiana purchase in       had the british defeated jackson at new orleans  they might have held on to the territory or returned it to spain  furthermore  article ix of the treaty of ghent stipulated that the united states must return land taken from the creeks to their original owners  essentially undoing the treaty of fort jackson  thanks to jackson s victory at new orleans  the american government felt that it could safely ignore that provision and it kept the lands that jackson had acquired 

jackson  still not knowing for certain of the treaty s signing  refused to lift martial law in the city  in march       after u s  district court judge dominic a  hall signed a writ of  habeas corpus  on behalf of a louisiana legislator whom jackson had detained  jackson ordered hall s arrest  state senator louis louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the new orleans newspaper  challenging jackson s refusal to release the militia after the british ceded the field of battle  he too was put in jail  jackson did not relent his campaign of suppressing dissent until after ordering the arrest of a louisiana legislator  a federal judge  and a lawyer  and after the intervention of state judge joshua lewis  lewis was simultaneously serving under jackson in the militia  and also had signed a writ of  habeas corpus  against jackson  his commanding officer  seeking judge hall s release 

civilian authorities in new orleans had reason to fear jackson   he summarily ordered the execution of six members of the militia who had attempted to leave  their deaths were not well publicized until the coffin handbills were circulated during his      presidential campaign 

following the war  jackson remained in command of troops on the southern border of the u s  he conducted business from the hermitage  he signed treaties with the cherokee and chickasaw which gained for the united states large parts of tennessee and kentucky  the treaty with the chickasaw  finally agreed to later in the year  is commonly known as the jackson purchase 

several native american tribes  which became known as the seminole  straddled the border between the u s  and florida  the seminole  in alliance with escaped slaves  frequently raided georgia settlements before retreating back into florida  these skirmishes continually escalated  and the conflict is now known as the first seminole war  in       jackson led a detachment into florida which destroyed the negro fort  a community of escaped slaves and their descendants  jackson was ordered by president monroe in december      to lead a campaign in georgia against the seminole and creek indians  jackson was also charged with preventing florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves  after spain promised freedom to fugitive slaves  critics later alleged that jackson exceeded orders in his florida actions  his orders from president monroe were to  terminate the conflict   jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize florida from spain once and for all  before departing  jackson wrote to monroe   let it be signified to me through any channel      that the possession of the floridas would be desirable to the united states  and in sixty days it will be accomplished  

jackson invaded florida on march           capturing pensacola  he crushed seminole and spanish resistance in the region and captured two british agents  robert ambrister and alexander arbuthnot  who had been working with the seminole  after a brief trial  jackson executed both of the men  causing a diplomatic incident with the british  jackson s actions polarized monroe s cabinet  some of whom argued that jackson had gone against monroe s orders and violated the constitution  since the united states had not declared war upon spain  he was defended by secretary of state john quincy adams  adams thought that jackson s conquest of florida would force spain to finally sell the province  and spain did indeed sell florida to the united states in the adams   on  s treaty of       a congressional investigation exonerated jackson  but he was deeply angered by the criticism he received  particularly from speaker of the house henry clay  after the ratification of the adams   on  s treaty in       jackson resigned from the army and briefly served as the territorial governor of florida before returning to tennessee 

in the spring of       jackson suffered a physical breakdown  his body had two bullets lodged in it  and he had grown exhausted from years of hard military campaigning  he regularly coughed up blood  and his entire body shook  jackson feared that he was on the brink of death  after several months of rest  he recovered  during his convalescence  jackson s thoughts increasingly turned to national affairs  he obsessed over rampant corruption in the monroe administration and grew to detest the second bank of the united states  blaming it for causing the panic of      by contracting credit 

jackson turned down an offer to run for governor of his home state  but accepted john overton s plan to have the legislature nominate him for president  on july           he was officially nominated by the tennessee legislature  jackson had come to dislike secretary of the treasury william h  crawford  who had been the most vocal critic of jackson in monroe s cabinet  and he hoped to prevent tennessee s electoral votes from going to crawford  yet jackson s nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of tennessee  as many americans appreciated jackson s attacks on banks  the panic of      had devastated the fortunes of many  and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular  with his growing political viability  jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates  along with crawford  adams  clay  and secretary of war john c  calhoun  during the era of good feelings  the federalist party had faded away  and all five presidential contenders were members of the democratic republican party  jackson s campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people  as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions  on the major issues of the day  most prominently the tariff  jackson expressed centrist beliefs  and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions  at the forefront of jackson s campaign was combatting corruption  jackson vowed to restore honesty in government and to scale back its excesses 

in       jackson reluctantly allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of tennessee s u s  senate seats  the move was independently orchestrated by his advisors william berkeley lewis and u s  senator john eaton in order to defeat incumbent john williams  who openly opposed his presidential candidacy  the legislature narrowly elected him  his return  after    years     months    days out of office  marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history  although jackson was reluctant to serve once more in the senate  he was appointed chairman of the committee on military affairs  eaton wrote to rachel that jackson as a senator was  in harmony and good understanding with every body   including thomas hart benton  now a senator from missouri  with whom jackson had fought in       meanwhile  jackson himself did little active campaigning for the presidency  as was customary  eaton updated an already written biography of him in preparation for the campaign and  along with others  wrote letters to newspapers praising jackson s record and past conduct 

democratic republican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses  but this method had become unpopular  in       most of the democratic republicans in congress boycotted the caucus  those who attended backed crawford for president and albert gallatin for vice president  a pennsylvania convention nominated jackson for president a month later  stating that the irregular caucus ignored the  voice of the people  in the  vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into a belief that he  crawford  was the regular democratic candidate   gallatin criticized jackson as  an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory  but from incapacity  military habits  and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions  altogether unfit for the office   after jackson won the pennsylvania nomination  calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead 

in the presidential election  jackson won a plurality of the electoral vote  taking several southern and western states as well as the mid atlantic states of pennsylvania and new jersey  he was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base  as adams dominated new england  clay took three western states  and crawford won virginia and georgia  jackson won a plurality of the popular vote  taking    percent  although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency  he won    electoral votes  more than any other candidate  but still short of      which he needed for a true majority  with no candidate having won a majority of the electoral votes  the house of representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment  the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote winners are eligible to be elected by the house  so clay was eliminated from contention  jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election  as crawford and adams lacked jackson s national appeal  and crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency  clay  who as speaker of the house presided over the election  saw jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership  he threw his support behind adams  who shared clay s support for federally funded internal improvements such as roads and canals  with clay s backing  adams won the contingent election on the first ballot  furious supporters of jackson accused clay and adams of having reached a  corrupt bargain  after adams appointed clay as his secretary of state   so you see   jackson growled   the judas of the west has closed the contract and receive the thirty pieces of silver   h is end will be the same   after the election  jackson resigned his senate seat and returned to tennessee 

almost immediately  opposition arose to the adams presidency  jackson opposed adams s plan to involve the u s  in panama s quest for independence  writing   the moment we engage in confederations  or alliances with any nation  we may from that time date the down fall of our republic   adams damaged his standing in his first annual message to congress  when he argued that congress must not give the world the impression  that we are palsied by the will of our constituents  

jackson was nominated for president by the tennessee legislature in october       more than three years before the      election  it was the earliest such nomination in presidential history  and it attested to the fact that jackson s supporters began the      campaign almost as soon as the      campaign ended  adams s presidency floundered  as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics  critics led by jackson attacked adams s policies as a dangerous expansion of federal power  new york senator martin van buren  who had been a prominent supporter of crawford in       emerged as one of the strongest opponents of adams s policies  and he settled on jackson as his preferred candidate in       van buren was joined by vice president calhoun  who opposed much of adams s agenda on states  rights grounds  van buren and other jackson allies established numerous pro jackson newspapers and clubs around the country  while jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his hermitage plantation  in the election  jackson won a commanding    percent of the popular vote and    percent of the electoral vote  the election marked the definitive end of the one party era of good feelings  as jackson s supporters coalesced into the democratic party and adams s followers became known as the national republicans  in the large scots irish community that was especially numerous in the rural south and southwest  jackson was a favorite 

the campaign was heavily personal  as was the custom at the time  neither candidate personally campaigned  but their political followers organized campaign events  both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press  jackson was labelled a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior  a series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills were published to attack jackson  one of which revealed his order to execute soldiers at new orleans  another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of american indians killed in battle  while still another labeled his mother a  common prostitute  and stated that jackson s father was a  mulatto man  

rachel jackson was also a frequent target of attacks  and was widely accused of bigamy  a reference to the controversial situation of her marriage with jackson  jackson s campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as minister to russia  adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for emperor alexander i  they also stated that adams had a billiard table in the white house and that he had charged the government for it 

rachel had been under extreme stress during the election  and often struggled while jackson was away  she began experiencing significant physical stress during the election season  jackson described her symptoms as  excruciating pain in the left shoulder  arm  and breast   after struggling for three days  rachel finally died of a heart attack on december          three weeks after her husband s victory in the election  which began on october    and ended on december    and    weeks before jackson took office as president  a distraught jackson had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body  he felt that the abuse from adams s supporters had hastened her death and never forgave him  rachel was buried at the hermitage on christmas eve   may god almighty forgive her murderers   jackson swore at her funeral   i never can  

jackson s name has been associated with jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties   the age of jackson  shaped the national agenda and american politics  jackson s philosophy as president was similar to that of jefferson  advocating republican values held by the revolutionary generation  jackson took a moral tone  with the belief that agrarian sympathies  and a limited view of states rights and the federal government  would produce less corruption  he feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values  when south carolina opposed the tariff law  he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession 

jackson believed in the ability of the people to  arrive at right conclusions   they had the right not only to elect but to  instruct their agents   representatives   office holders should either obey the popular will or resign  he rejected the view of a powerful and independent supreme court with binding decisions  arguing that  the congress  the executive  and the court must each or itself be guided by its own opinions of the constitution   jackson thought that supreme court justices should be made to stand for election  and believed in strict constructionism as the best way to insure democratic rule  he called for term limits on presidents and the abolition of the electoral college  jackson  was far ahead of his times   and maybe even further than this country can ever achieve  

jackson departed from the hermitage on january    and arrived in washington on february     he then set about choosing his cabinet members  jackson chose van buren as expected for secretary of state  eaton of tennessee as secretary of war  samuel d  ingham of pennsylvania as secretary of treasury  john branch of north carolina as secretary of navy  john m  berrien of georgia as attorney general  and william t  barry of kentucky as postmaster general  jackson s first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful  full of bitter partisanship and gossip  jackson blamed adams in part for what was said about rachel during the campaign  and refused to meet him after arriving in washington  therefore  adams chose not to attend the inauguration 

on march          andrew jackson became the first united states president elect to take the oath of office on the east portico of the u s  capitol  in his inaugural speech  jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency  he also promised to pursue  reform  by removing power from  unfaithful or incompetent hands   at the conclusion of the ceremony  jackson invited the public to the white house  where his supporters held a raucous party  thousands of spectators overwhelmed the white house staff  and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings  jackson s populism earned him the nickname  king mob  

jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the  petticoat affair  or  eaton affair   washington gossip circulated among jackson s cabinet members and their wives  including calhoun s wife floride calhoun  concerning secretary of war eaton and his wife peggy eaton  salacious rumors held that peggy  as a barmaid in her father s tavern  had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute  controversy also ensued because peggy had married soon after her previous husband s death  and it was alleged that she and her husband had engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living  petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members  led by mrs  calhoun  refused to socialize with the eatons  allowing a prostitute in the official family was unthinkable   but jackson refused to believe the rumors  telling his cabinet that  she is as chaste as a virgin   jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers  who in essence questioned and dishonored jackson himself by  in attempting to drive the eatons out  daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet  jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife  these memories increased his dedication to defending peggy eaton 

meanwhile  the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake  they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage  a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable  historian daniel walker howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman s rights movement  secretary of state martin van buren  a widower  was already forming a coalition against calhoun  he could now see his main chance to strike hard  he took the side of jackson and eaton 

in the spring of       jackson  at van buren s suggestion  demanded the resignations of all the cabinet members except barry  van buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias  in       jackson nominated van buren to be minister to great britain  calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie breaking vote against it  claiming the defeated nomination would     kill  van buren   sir  kill dead  he will never kick  sir  never kick   van buren continued to serve as an important adviser to jackson and was placed on the ticket for vice president in the      election  making him jackson s heir apparent  the petticoat affair led to the development of the kitchen cabinet  the kitchen cabinet emerged as an unofficial group of advisors to the president  its existence was partially rooted in jackson s difficulties with his official cabinet  even after the purging 

throughout his eight years in office  jackson made about    treaties with native american tribes both in the south and the northwest  jackson s presidency marked a new era in indian anglo american relations initiating a policy of indian removal  jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes  though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates  the southern tribes included the choctaw  creek  chickasaw  seminole and the cherokee  the northwest tribes include the chippewa  ottawa  and the potawatomi 

relations between indians and americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts  previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to  civilize  the indians  but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention  there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue  and out of this policy to relocate certain indian populations  jackson  never known for timidity  became an advocate for this relocation policy in what many historians consider the most controversial aspect of his presidency 

in his first annual message to congress  jackson advocated land west of the mississippi river be set aside for indian tribes  on may           congress passed the indian removal act  which jackson signed into law two days later  the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west  outside of existing state borders  the act specifically pertained to the five civilized tribes in the south  the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law  effectively relinquishing their sovereignty 
jackson  eaton  and general coffee negotiated with the chickasaw  who quickly agreed to move  jackson put eaton and coffee in charge of negotiating with the choctaw  lacking jackson s skills at negotiation  they frequently bribed the chiefs in order to gain their submission  the tactics worked  and the chiefs agreed to move  the removal of the choctaw took place in the winter of      and       and was wrought with misery and suffering  the seminole  despite the signing of the treaty of payne s landing in       refused to move  in december       this dispute began the second seminole war  the war lasted over six years  finally ending in       members of the creek nation had signed the treaty of cusseta in       allowing the creek to either sell or retain their land  conflict later erupted between the creek who remained and the white settlers  leading to a second creek war  a common complaint amongst the tribes was that the men who had signed the treaties did not represent the whole tribe 

the state of georgia became involved in a contentious dispute with the cherokee  culminating in the      supreme court decision in  worcester v  georgia   chief justice john marshall  writing for the court  ruled that georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands  as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople  jackson is frequently attributed the following response   john marshall has made his decision  now let him enforce it   the quote  apparently indicating jackson s dismissive view of the courts  was attributed to jackson by horace greeley  who cited as his source representative george n  briggs  remini argues that jackson did not say it because  while it  certainly sounds like jackson    t here was nothing for him to enforce   this is because a writ of  habeas corpus  had never been issued for the missionaries  the court also did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision  as had become standard 

a group of cherokees led by john ridge negotiated the treaty of new echota  ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the cherokee  and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate  another faction  led by john ross  unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal  the cherokee largely considered themselves independent  and not subject to the laws of the united states or georgia  the treaty was enforced by jackson s successor  van buren  subsequently  as many as       out of        cherokees died on the  trail of tears  in       more than        american indians were relocated to the west during jackson s administration  though a few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high smoky mountains  the black hawk war took place during jackson s presidency in      after a group of indians crossed into u s  territory 

in an effort to purge the government of corruption  jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments  he believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies  he asked congress to reform embezzlement laws  reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions  revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties  and laws to improve government accounting  jackson s postmaster general barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services  collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts  as well as failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances  jackson replaced barry with treasury auditor and prominent kitchen cabinet member amos kendall  who went on to implement much needed reforms in the post office department 
jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the electoral college by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president  in his third annual message to congress  he expressed the view  i have heretofore recommended amendments of the federal constitution giving the election of president and vice president to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term  so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not  in accordance with my sense of duty  omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress  

although he was unable to implement these goals  jackson s time in office did see a variety of other reforms  he supported an act in july      that enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husband s pensions  in       jackson established the ten hour day in national shipyards 

jackson enforced the tenure of office act  signed by president monroe in       that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates  jackson believed that a rotation in office was a democratic reform preventing hereditary officeholding and made civil service responsible to the popular will  jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was  a leading principle in the republican creed   jackson noted   in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another   jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy  the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents  jackson only rotated about     of federal office holders during his first term  some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes  jackson  nonetheless  used his presidential power to award loyal democrats by granting them federal office appointments  jackson s approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office  having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to postmaster  jackson stated    i f he lost his leg fighting for his country  that is     enough for me  

jackson s theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system  the political realities of washington sometimes forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations  supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington  such as the new york customs house  the postal service  the departments of navy and war  and the bureau of indian affairs  whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades  proved to be difficult  remini claims that because  friendship  politics  and geography constituted the president s total criteria for appointments  most of his appointments were predictably substandard  

in       congress had approved the  tariff of abominations   which set the tariff at an historically high rate  southern planters  who sold their cotton on the world market  strongly opposed this tariff  which they saw as favoring northern interests  the south now had to pay more for goods it did not produce locally  and other countries would have more difficulty affording southern cotton  the issue came to a head during jackson s presidency  resulting in the nullification crisis  in which south carolina threatened disunion 

the south carolina exposition and protest of       secretly written by calhoun  asserted that their state had the right to  nullify    declare void   the tariff legislation of       although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate  he also vigorously supported a strong union  with effective powers for the central government  jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue  which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men  one incident came at the april           jefferson day dinner  involving after dinner toasts  robert hayne began by toasting to  the union of the states  and the sovereignty of the states   jackson then rose  and in a booming voice added  our federal union  it must be preserved        a clear challenge to calhoun  calhoun clarified his position by responding  the union  next to our liberty  the most dear  

in may       jackson discovered that calhoun had asked president monroe to censure jackson for his invasion of spanish florida in      while calhoun was serving as secretary of war  calhoun s and jackson s relationship deteriorated further  by february       the break between calhoun and jackson was final  responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud  calhoun had published letters between him and jackson detailing the conflict in the  united states telegraph   jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until jackson stopped it in july  the  telegraph   edited by duff green  initially supported jackson  after it sided with calhoun on nullification  jackson needed a new organ for the administration  he enlisted the help of longtime supporter francis preston blair  who in november      established a newspaper known as the  washington globe   which from then on served as the primary mouthpiece of the democratic party 

jackson supported a revision to tariff rates known as the tariff of       it was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates  written by treasury secretary louis mclane  the bill lowered duties from     to      in may  representative john quincy adams introduced a slightly revised version of the bill  which jackson accepted  it passed congress on july   and was signed by the president on july     the bill ultimately failed to satisfy extremists on either side  on november     the south carolina legislature officially nullified both the tariff of      and the tariff of       in response  jackson sent u s  navy warships to charleston harbor  and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession  on december           calhoun resigned as vice president to become a u s  senator for south carolina  this was part of a strategy whereby calhoun  with less than three months remaining on his vice presidential term  would replace robert y  hayne in the senate  who would then become governor  hayne had often struggled to defend nullification on the floor of the senate  especially against fierce criticism from senator daniel webster of massachusetts 

in december       jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the  nullifiers   stating that he considered  the power to annul a law of the united states  assumed by one state  incompatible with the existence of the union  contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution  unauthorized by its spirit  inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded  and destructive of the great object for which it was formed   south carolina  the president declared  stood on  the brink of insurrection and treason   and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought  jackson also denied the right of secession   the constitution      forms a government not a league      to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states are not a nation   jackson tended to personalize the controversy  frequently characterizing nullification as a conspiracy between disappointed and bitter men whose ambitions had been thwarted 

jackson asked congress to pass a  force bill  explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff  it was introduced by senator felix grundy of tennessee  and was quickly attacked by calhoun as  military despotism   at the same time  calhoun and clay began to work on a new compromise tariff  a bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by representative gulian c  verplanck of new york  but it lowered rates more sharply than clay and other protectionists desired  clay managed to get calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for clay s opposition to jackson s military threats and  perhaps  with the hope that he could win some southern votes in his next bid for the presidency  the compromise tariff passed on march          the force bill passed the same day  calhoun  clay  and several others marched out of the chamber in opposition  with the only dissenting vote coming from john tyler of virginia  the new tariff was opposed by webster  who argued that it essentially surrendered to south carolina s demands  jackson  despite his anger over the scrapping of the verplanck bill and the new alliance between clay and calhoun  saw it as an efficient way to end the crisis  he signed both bills on march    starting with the force bill  the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance  but in a final show of defiance  nullified the force bill  on may    jackson wrote   the tariff was only the pretext  and disunion and southern confederacy the real object  the next pretext will be the negro  or slavery question  

addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his first annual address to congress  jackson declared it to be his  settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong  

when jackson took office  spoliation claims  or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors  dating from the napoleonic era  caused strained relations between the u s  and french governments  the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules  according to secretary of state martin van buren  relations between the u s  and france were  hopeless   jackson s minister to france  william c  rives  through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july          that would award the u s                              in damages  the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties  the french king louis philippe i and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies  by       the non payment of reparations by the french government drew jackson s ire and he became impatient  in   jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for non payment  stating the federal government was  wholly disappointed  by the french  and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france  feeling insulted by jackson s words  the french people began pressuring their government not to pay the indemnity until jackson had apologized for his remarks  in his december      state of the union address  jackson refused to apologize  stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful  jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment  the french accepted jackson s statements as sincere and in february       reparations were paid 

in addition to france  the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with denmark  portugal  and spain  jackson s state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with russia  spain  turkey  great britain  and siam  under the treaty of great britain  american trade was reopened in the west indies  the trade agreement with siam was america s first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country  as a result  american exports increased     while imports increased      

jackson s attempt to purchase texas from mexico for            failed  the charg   d affaires in mexico  colonel anthony butler  suggested that the u s  take texas over militarily  but jackson refused  butler was later replaced toward the end of jackson s presidency  in       the texas revolution began when pro slavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government for texan independence  by may       they had routed the mexican military  establishing an independent republic of texas  the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states  jackson was hesitant in recognizing texas  unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico  and not wanting to make texas an anti slavery issue during the      election  the strategy worked  the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact  and van buren was elected president  jackson formally recognized the republic of texas  nominating alc  e louis la branche as charg   d affaires on the last full day of his presidency  march         

jackson failed in his efforts to open trade with china and japan and was unsuccessful at thwarting great britain s presence and power in south america 

the      presidential election demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period  the democratic party s first national convention  held in baltimore  nominated jackson s choice for vice president  van buren  the national republican party  who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december       nominated henry clay  now a senator from kentucky  and john sergeant of pennsylvania  the anti masonic party emerged by capitalizing on opposition to freemasonry  which existed primarily in new england  after the disappearance and possible murder of william morgan  the party  which had earlier held its convention also in baltimore in september       nominated william wirt of maryland and amos ellmaker of pennsylvania  clay was  like jackson  a mason  and so some anti jacksonians who would have supported the national republican party supported wirt instead 

in       the second bank of the united states was chartered by president james madison to restore the united states economy devastated by the war of       monroe had appointed nicholas biddle as the bank s executive  jackson believed that the bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly  its stock was mostly held by foreigners  he insisted  and it exerted an unfair amount of control over the political system  jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values  believing the bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy  jackson stated the bank made  the rich richer and the potent more powerful   he accused it of making loans with the intent of influencing elections  in his address to congress in       jackson called for a substitute for the bank that would have no private stockholders and no ability to lend or purchase land  its only power would be to issue bills of exchange  the address touched off fiery debate in the senate  thomas hart benton  now a strong supporter of the president despite the brawl years earlier  gave a speech strongly denouncing the bank and calling for open debate on its recharter  webster led a motion to narrowly defeat the resolution  shortly afterward  the  globe  announced that jackson would stand for reelection 

despite his misgivings about the bank  he supported a plan proposed in late      by his moderately pro bank treasury secretary louis mclane  who was secretly working with biddle  to recharter a reformed version of the bank in a way that would free up funds which would in turn be used to strengthen the military or pay off the nation s debt  this would be done  in part  through the sale of government stock in the bank  over the objections of attorney general roger b  taney  an irreconcilable opponent of the bank  jackson allowed mclane to publish a treasury report which essentially recommended rechartering the bank 

clay hoped to make the bank an issue in the election  so as to accuse jackson of going beyond his powers if he vetoed a recharter bill  he and webster urged biddle to immediately apply for recharter rather than wait to reach a compromise with the administration  biddle received advice to the contrary from moderate democrats such as mclane and william lewis  who argued that biddle should wait because jackson would likely veto the recharter bill  on january         biddle submitted to congress a renewal of the bank s charter without any of the proposed reforms  the submission came four years before the original    year charter was to end  biddle s recharter bill passed the senate on june    and the house on july          jackson determined to veto it  many moderate democrats  including mclane  were appalled by the perceived arrogance of the bill and supported his decision  when van buren met jackson on july    jackson declared   the bank  mr  van buren  is trying to kill me  but i will kill it   jackson officially vetoed the bill on july     the veto message was crafted primarily by taney  kendall  and jackson s nephew and advisor andrew jackson donelson  it attacked the bank as an agent of inequality that supported only the wealthy  the veto was considered  one of the strongest and most controversial  presidential statements and  a brilliant political manifesto   the national republican party immediately made jackson s veto of the bank a political issue  jackson s political opponents castigated the veto as  the very slang of the leveller and demagogue   claiming jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man 

at biddle s direction  the bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat jackson  seemingly confirming jackson s view that it interfered in the political process  on july     clay said privately   the campaign is over  and i think we have won the victory   jackson successfully portrayed his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny  clay proved to be no match for jackson s ability to resonate with the people and the democratic party s strong political networks  democratic newspapers  parades  barbecues  and rallies increased jackson s popularity  jackson himself made numerous public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington  d c  jackson won the election by a landslide  receiving    percent of the popular vote and     electoral votes  clay received    percent of the popular vote and    electoral votes  wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the anti masonic party eventually declined  jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the bank s recharter and his continued warfare on the bank s control over the national economy 

in       jackson attempted to begin removing federal deposits from the bank  whose money lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america  thus drastically increasing credit and speculation  jackson s moves were greatly controversial  he removed mclane from the treasury department  having him serve instead as secretary of state  replacing edward livingston  he replaced mclane with william j  duane  in september  he fired duane for refusing to remove the deposits  signalling his intent to continue battling the bank  he replaced duane with taney  under taney  the deposits began to be removed  they were placed in a variety of state banks which were friendly to the administration s policies  known to critics as pet banks  biddle responded by stockpiling the bank s reserves and contracting credit  thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic  the moves were intended to force jackson into a compromise   nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad will produce any effect in congress   he wrote  at first  biddle s strategy was successful  putting enormous pressure on jackson  but jackson handled the situation well  when people came to him complaining  he referred them to biddle  saying that he was the man who had  all the money   jackson s approach worked  biddle s strategy backfired  increasing anti bank sentiment 

in       those who disagreed with jackson s expansion of executive power united and formed the whig party  calling jackson  king andrew i   and named their party after the english whigs who opposed seventeenth century british monarchy  a movement emerged among whigs in the senate to censure jackson  the censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by clay  which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson  jackson called clay  reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel   on march     the senate voted to censure jackson          it also rejected taney as treasury secretary  the house however  led by ways and means committee chairman james k  polk  declared on april   that the bank  ought not to be rechartered  and that the depositions  ought not to be restored   it voted to continue allowing pet banks to be places of deposit and voted even more overwhelmingly to investigate whether the bank had deliberately instigated the panic  jackson called the passage of these resolutions a  glorious triumph   it essentially sealed the bank s demise  the democrats later suffered a temporary setback  polk ran for speaker of the house to replace andrew stevenson  after southerners discovered his connection to van buren  he was defeated by fellow tennessean john bell  a democrat turned whig who opposed jackson s removal policy 

the national economy following the withdrawal of the remaining funds from the bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills 

on january          jackson paid off the entire national debt  the only time in u s  history that has been accomplished  the objective had been reached in part through jackson s reforms aimed at eliminating the misuse of funds and through his vetoes of legislation had he deemed extravagant  in december       polk defeated bell in a rematch and was elected speaker  finally  on january           when the jacksonians had a majority in the senate  the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters  the expunction movement was led ironically by benton 

in       in response to increased land speculation  jackson issued the specie circular  an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in  specie   gold or silver coins   the result was high demand for specie  which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes  contributing to the panic of       the white house van buren biography notes   basically the trouble was the   th century cyclical economy of  boom and bust   which was following its regular pattern  but jackson s financial measures contributed to the crash  his destruction of the second bank of the united states had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks  wild speculation in lands  based on easy bank credit  had swept the west  to end this speculation  jackson in      had issued a specie circular    

the first recorded physical attack on a u s  president was directed at jackson  he had ordered the dismissal of robert b  randolph from the navy for embezzlement  on may          jackson sailed on uss  cygnet  to fredericksburg  virginia  where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of mary ball washington  george washington s mother  during a stopover near alexandria  randolph appeared and struck the president  he fled the scene chased by several members of jackson s party  including the writer washington irving  jackson declined to press charges 

on january           what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the united states capitol  when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of south carolina representative warren r  davis  richard lawrence  an unemployed house painter from england  aimed a pistol at jackson  which misfired  lawrence then pulled out a second pistol  which also misfired  historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring  jackson  infuriated  attacked lawrence with his cane  others present  including davy  crockett  restrained and disarmed lawrence 

lawrence offered a variety of explanations for the shooting  he blamed jackson for the loss of his job  he claimed that with the president dead   money would be more plenty    a reference to jackson s struggle with the bank of the united states  and that he  could not rise until the president fell   finally  lawrence told his interrogators that he was a deposed english king   specifically  richard iii  dead since        and that jackson was his clerk  he was deemed insane and was institutionalized 

afterwards  the pistols were tested and retested  each time they performed perfectly  many believed that jackson had been protected by the same providence that also protected their young nation  the incident became a part of jacksonian mythos  jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies might have orchestrated the attempt on his life  his suspicions were never proven 

during the summer of       northern abolitionists began sending anti slavery tracts through the postal system into the south  pro slavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials  which were deemed  incendiary   and some began to riot  jackson wanted sectional peace  and desired to placate southerners ahead of the      election  he fiercely disliked the abolitionists  whom he believed were  by instituting sectional jealousies  attempting to destroy the union  jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection  he supported the solution of postmaster general amos kendall  which gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti slavery tracts  that december  jackson called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of  incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection  

jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office  the last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from      to       led by stephen h  harriman on the red river of the north  jackson s predecessor  president adams  attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in       but congress was unwilling to fund the effort  when jackson assumed office in      he pocketed adams  expedition plans  eventually  wanting to establish his presidential legacy  similar to jefferson and the lewis and clark expedition  jackson sponsored scientific exploration during his second term  on may           jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic united states exploring expedition  jackson put secretary of the navy mahlon dickerson in charge  to assemble suitable ships  officers  and scientific staff for the expedition  with a planned launch before jackson s term of office expired  dickerson proved unfit for the task  preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until       during the presidency of van buren  one brig ship    later used in the expedition  having been commissioned by secretary dickerson in may       circumnavigated the world and explored and mapped the southern ocean  confirming the existence of the antarctica continent 

in spite of economic success following jackson s vetoes and war against the bank  reckless speculation in land and railroads eventually caused the panic of       contributing factors included jackson s veto of the second national bank renewal charter in      and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in      that caused western banks to relax their lending standards  two other jacksonian acts in      contributed to the panic of       the specie circular  which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver  and the deposit and distribution act  which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks and in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks  jackson s specie circular  albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy  left many investors unable to afford to pay loans in gold and silver  the same year there was a downturn in great britain s economy that stopped investment in the united states  as a result  the u s  economy went into a depression  banks became insolvent  the national debt  previously paid off  increased  business failures rose  cotton prices dropped  and unemployment dramatically increased  the depression that followed lasted for four years until       when the economy began to rebound 

jackson appointed six justices to the supreme court  most were undistinguished  his first appointee  john mclean  had been nominated in barry s place after barry had agreed to become postmaster general  mclean  turned whig and forever schemed to win  the presidency  his next two appointees   henry baldwin and james moore wayne   disagreed with jackson on some points but were poorly regarded even by jackson s enemies  in reward for his services  jackson nominated taney to the court to fill a vacancy in january       but the nomination failed to win senate approval  chief justice marshall died in       leaving two vacancies on the court  jackson nominated taney for chief justice and philip pendleton barbour for associate justice  both were confirmed by the new senate  taney served as chief justice until       presiding over a court that upheld many of the precedents set by the marshall court  he was generally regarded as a good and respectable judge  but his opinion in  dred scott v  sandford  largely overshadows his career  on the last full day of his presidency  jackson nominated john catron  who was confirmed 

two new states were admitted into the union during jackson s presidency  arkansas  june           and michigan  january            both states increased democratic power in congress and helped van buren win the presidency in       this was in keeping with the tradition that new states would support the party which had done the most to admit them 

in       after serving two terms as president  jackson was replaced by his chosen successor martin van buren and retired to the hermitage  he immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son  andrew jackson jr  although he suffered ill health  jackson remained highly influential in both national and state politics  he was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession  insisting   i will die with the union   blamed for causing the panic of       he was unpopular in his early retirement  jackson continued to denounce the  perfidy and treachery  of banks and urged his successor  van buren  to repudiate the specie circular as president 

as a solution to the panic  he supported an independent treasury system  which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation  a coalition of conservative democrats and whigs opposed the bill  and it was not passed until       during the delay  no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression  van buren grew deeply unpopular  a unified whig party nominated popular war hero william henry harrison and former jacksonian john tyler in the      presidential election  the whigs  campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the democrats when jackson ran  they depicted van buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary americans  while glorifying harrison s military record and portraying him as a man of the people  jackson campaigned heavily for van buren in tennessee  he favored the nomination of polk for vice president at the      democratic national convention over controversial incumbent richard mentor johnson  no nominee was chosen  and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors 

harrison won the election  and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress   the democracy of the united states has been shamefully beaten   jackson wrote to van buren   but i trust  not conquered   harrison died only a month into his term  and was replaced by tyler  jackson was encouraged because tyler had a strong independent streak and was not bound by party lines  sure enough  tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the whigs in      when he vetoed two whig sponsored bills to establish a new national bank  bringing satisfaction to jackson and other democrats  after the second veto  tyler s entire cabinet  with the exception of daniel webster  resigned 

jackson strongly favored the annexation of texas  a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency  while jackson still feared that annexation would stir up anti slavery sentiment  his belief that the british would use texas as a base to threaten the united states overrode his other concerns  he also insisted that texas was part of the louisiana purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the united states  at the request of senator robert j  walker of mississippi  acting on behalf of the tyler administration  which also supported annexation  jackson wrote several letters to texas president sam houston  urging him to wait for the senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the united states would benefit texas  initially prior to the      election  jackson again supported van buren for president and polk for vice president  a treaty of annexation was signed by tyler on april           and submitted to the senate  when a letter from secretary of state calhoun to british ambassador richard pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public  anti annexation sentiment exploded in the north and the bill failed to be ratified  van buren decided to write the  hamlet letter   opposing annexation  this effectively extinguished any support that van buren might previously have enjoyed in the south  the whig nominee  henry clay  also opposed annexation  and jackson recognized the need for the democrats to nominate a candidate who supported it and could therefore gain the support of the south  if the plan failed  jackson warned  texas would not join the union and would potentially fall victim to a mexican invasion supported by the british 

jackson met with polk  robert armstrong  and andrew jackson donelson in his study  he then pointed directly at a startled polk  telling him that  as a man from the southwest and a supporter of annexation  he would be the perfect candidate  polk called the scheme  utterly abortive   but agreed to go along with it  at the      democratic national convention  polk emerged as the party s nominee after van buren failed to win the required two thirds majority of delegates  george m  dallas was selected for vice president  jackson convinced tyler to drop his plans of running for re election as an independent by promising  as tyler requested  to welcome the president and his allies back into the democratic party and by instructing blair to stop criticizing the president  polk won the election  defeating clay  a bill of annexation was passed by congress in february and signed by tyler on march   

jackson died at his plantation on june          at the age of     of chronic dropsy and heart failure  according to a newspaper account from the boon lick times    he  fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed     but he subsequently revived     gen  jackson died at the hermitage at    o clock p m  on sunday the  th instant      when the messenger finally came  the old soldier  patriot and christian was looking out for his approach  he is gone  but his memory lives  and will continue to live   in his will  jackson left his entire estate to andrew jackson jr  except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members 

jackson had three adopted sons  theodore  an indian about whom little is known  andrew jackson jr   the son of rachel s brother severn donelson  and lyncoya  a creek indian orphan adopted by jackson after the battle of tallushatchee  lyncoya died of tuberculosis on july          at the age of sixteen 

the jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children  john samuel donelson  daniel smith donelson  and andrew jackson donelson were the sons of rachel s brother samuel donelson  who died in       andrew jackson hutchings was rachel s orphaned grand nephew  caroline butler  eliza butler  edward butler  and anthony butler were the orphaned children of edward butler  a family friend  they came to live with the jacksons after the death of their father 

the widower jackson invited rachel s niece emily donelson to serve as hostess at the white house  emily was married to andrew jackson donelson  who acted as jackson s private secretary and in      ran for vice president on the american party ticket  the relationship between the president and emily became strained during the petticoat affair  and the two became estranged for over a year  they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as white house hostess  sarah yorke jackson  the wife of andrew jackson jr   became co hostess of the white house in       it was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial first lady  sarah took over all hostess duties after emily died from tuberculosis in       jackson used rip raps as a retreat 

jackson s quick temper was notorious  biographer h  w  brands notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper   observers likened him to a volcano  and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt       his close associates all had stories of his blood curdling oaths  his summoning of the almighty to loose his wrath upon some miscreant  typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition  given his record   in duels  brawls  mutiny trials  and summary hearings   listeners had to take his vows seriously  

on the last day of his presidency  jackson admitted that he had but two regrets  that he  had been unable to shoot henry clay or to hang john c  calhoun   on his deathbed  he was once again quoted as regretting that he had not hanged calhoun for treason   my country would have sustained me in the act  and his fate would have been a warning to traitors in all time to come   he said  remini expresses the opinion that jackson was typically in control of his temper  and that he used his anger  along with his fearsome reputation  as a tool to get what he wanted 

jackson was a lean figure  standing at tall  and weighing between on average  jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair  which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age     he had penetrating deep blue eyes  jackson was one of the more sickly presidents  suffering from chronic headaches  abdominal pains  and a hacking cough  much of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed  that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake 

in       jackson became an official member of the first presbyterian church in nashville  both his mother and his wife had been devout presbyterians all their lives  but jackson himself had postponed officially entering the church in order to avoid accusations that he was joining only for political reasons 

jackson was a freemason  initiated at harmony lodge no    in tennessee  he also participated in chartering several other lodges in tennessee  he was the only u s  president to have served as grand master of a state s grand lodge until harry s  truman in       his masonic apron is on display in the tennessee state museum  an obelisk and bronze masonic plaque decorate his tomb at the hermitage 

jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in american history  historian charles grier sellers says   andrew jackson s masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the american stage   there has never been universal agreement on jackson s legacy  for  his opponents have ever been his most bitter enemies  and his friends almost his worshippers   he was always a fierce partisan  with many friends and many enemies  he has been lauded as the champion of the common man  while criticized for his treatment of indians and for other matters  james parton was the first man after jackson s death to write a full biography of him  trying to sum up the contradictions in his subject  he wrote 

jackson was criticized by his contemporary alexis de tocqueville in  democracy in america  for flattering the dominant ideas of his time  including the mistrust over the federal power  for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law 

in the   th century  jackson was written about by many admirers  arthur m  schlesinger jr  s  age of jackson         depicts jackson as a man of the people battling inequality and upper class tyranny  from the     s to the     s  robert remini published a three volume biography of jackson followed by an abridged one volume study  remini paints a generally favorable portrait of jackson  he contends that jacksonian democracy  stretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workable      as such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in american history   populism  progressivism  the new and fair deals  and the programs of the new frontier and great society   to remini  jackson serves as  the embodiment of the new american      this new man was no longer british  he no longer wore the queue and silk pants  he wore trousers  and he had stopped speaking with a british accent   other   th century writers such as richard hofstadter and bray hammond depict jackson as an advocate of the sort of  laissez faire  capitalism that benefits the rich and oppresses the poor 

jackson s initiatives to deal with the conflicts between indians and american settlers has been a source of controversy  starting mainly around       jackson came under attack from some historians on this issue  howard zinn called him  the most aggressive enemy of the indians in early american history  and  exterminator of indians   conversely  in       francis paul prucha argued that jackson s removal of the  five civilized tribes  from the extremely hostile white environment in the old south to oklahoma probably saved their very existence  similarly  remini claims that  if not for jackson s policies  the southern tribes would have been totally wiped out  just like other tribes namely  the yamasee  mahican  and narragansett   which did not move  jackson has long been honored  along with thomas jefferson  in the jefferson   jackson day fundraising dinners held by state democratic party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders  because both jefferson and jackson were slave owners  as well as because of jackson s indian removal policies  many state party organizations have renamed the dinners 

brands argues that jackson s reputation suffered since the     s as his actions towards indians and african americans received new attention  he also claims that the indian controversy overshadowed jackson s other achievements  noting shifting attitudes on different national issues  brands notes that he was often hailed during his lifetime as the  second george washington   because  while washington had fought for independence  jackson confirmed it at new orleans and made the united states a great power  over time  while the revolution has maintained a strong presence in the public conscience  memory of the war of       including the battle of new orleans  has sharply declined  brands argues that this is because once america had become a military power   it was easy to think that america had been destined for this role from the beginning  

still  jackson s performance in office has generally been ranked in the top half in public opinion polling  his position in c span s poll dropped from   th in      to   th in      

jackson has appeared on u s  banknotes as far back as       and extending into the   st century  his image has appeared on the              and         note  most recently  his image has appeared on the u s      federal reserve note beginning in       in       treasury secretary jack lew announced his goal that by      an image of harriet tubman would replace jackson s depiction on the front side of the     banknote  and that an image of jackson would be placed on the reverse side  though the final decision will be made by his successors 

jackson has appeared on several postage stamps  he first appeared on an      two cent stamp  which is commonly referred to by collectors as the  black jack  due to the large portraiture of jackson on its face printed in pitch black  during the american civil war  the confederate government issued two confederate postage stamps bearing jackson s portrait  one a and the other a   both issued in      

numerous counties and cities are named after him  including the city of jacksonville in florida and north carolina  the cities of jackson in louisiana  michigan  mississippi  missouri  and tennessee  jackson county in florida  illinois  michigan  mississippi  missouri  ohio  and oregon  and jackson parish in louisiana 

memorials to jackson include a set of four identical equestrian statues by the sculptor clark mills  in lafayette square  washington  d c   in jackson square  new orleans  in nashville on the grounds of the tennessee state capitol  and in jacksonville  florida  other equestrian statues of jackson have been erected elsewhere  as in the state capitol grounds in raleigh  north carolina  that statue controversially identifies him as one of the  presidents north carolina gave the nation   and he is featured alongside james polk and andrew johnson  both u s  presidents born in north carolina  there is a bust of andrew jackson in plaza ferdinand vii in pensacola  florida  where he became the first governor of the florida territory in       there is also a      bronze sculpture of andrew jackson by belle kinney scholz and leopold scholz in the u s  capitol building as part of the national statuary hall collection 

jackson and his wife rachel were the main subjects of a      historical novel by irving stone   the president s lady   which told the story of their lives up until rachel s death  the novel was the basis for the      film of the same name starring charlton heston as jackson and susan hayward as rachel 

jackson has been a supporting character in a number of historical films and television productions  lionel barrymore played jackson in  the gorgeous hussy          a fictionalized biography of peggy eaton starring joan crawford   the buccaneer          depicting the battle of new orleans  included hugh sothern as jackson  and was remade in      with heston again playing jackson  basil ruysdael played jackson in walt disney s       davy crockett  tv miniseries  wesley addy appeared as jackson in some episodes of the      pbs miniseries  the adams chronicles  

jackson is the protagonist of the comedic historic rock musical  bloody bloody andrew jackson         with music and lyrics by michael friedman and book by alex timbers 








andrew johnson

andrew johnson  december          july           was the   th president of the united states  serving from      to       johnson assumed the presidency as he was vice president of the united states at the time of the assassination of abraham lincoln  a democrat who ran with lincoln on the national union ticket  johnson came to office as the civil war concluded  he favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the union  his plans did not give protection to the former slaves  he came into conflict with the republican dominated congress  culminating in his impeachment by the house of representatives  he was acquitted in the senate by one vote 

johnson was born in poverty in raleigh  north carolina and never attended school  apprenticed as a tailor  he worked in several frontier towns before settling in greeneville  tennessee  he served as alderman and mayor there before being elected to the tennessee house of representatives in       after brief service in the tennessee senate  johnson was elected to the federal house of representatives in       where he served five two year terms  he became governor of tennessee for four years  and was elected by the legislature to the u s  senate in       in his congressional service  he sought passage of the homestead bill  which was enacted soon after he left his senate seat in       as southern slave states  including tennessee  seceded to form the confederate states of america  johnson remained firmly with the union  he was the only sitting senator from a confederate state who did not resign his seat upon learning of his state s secession  in       lincoln appointed him as military governor of tennessee after most of it had been retaken  in       johnson  as a war democrat and southern unionist  was a logical choice as running mate for lincoln  who wished to send a message of national unity in his reelection campaign  their ticket easily won  when johnson was sworn in as vice president in march       he gave a rambling speech  after which he secluded himself to avoid public ridicule  six weeks later  the assassination of lincoln made him president 

johnson implemented his own form of presidential reconstruction      a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to reform their civil governments  when southern states returned many of their old leaders  and passed black codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties  congressional republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the southern actions  johnson vetoed their bills  and congressional republicans overrode him  setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency  johnson opposed the fourteenth amendment  which gave citizenship to former slaves  in       johnson went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies  seeking to destroy his republican opponents  as the conflict between the branches of government grew  congress passed the tenure of office act  restricting johnson s ability to fire cabinet officials  when he persisted in trying to dismiss secretary of war edwin stanton  he was impeached by the house of representatives  and narrowly avoided conviction in the senate and removal from office  after failing to win the      democratic presidential nomination  johnson left office in      

returning to tennessee after his presidency  johnson sought political vindication  and gained it in his eyes when he was elected to the senate again in       making johnson the only former president to serve in the senate  he died months into his term  while some admire johnson s strict constitutionalism  his strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for african americans is widely criticized  he is regarded by many historians as one of the worst presidents in american history 

andrew johnson was born in raleigh  north carolina  on december           to jacob johnson               and mary   polly   mcdonough                a laundress  he was of english  scots irish  and irish ancestry  he had a brother william  four years his senior  and an older sister elizabeth  who died in childhood  johnson s birth in a two room shack was a political asset in the mid   th century  and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins  jacob johnson was a poor man  as had been his father  william johnson  but he became town constable of raleigh before marrying and starting a family  both jacob and mary were illiterate  and had worked as tavern servants  while johnson never attended school  johnson grew up in poverty  jacob died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell  shortly after rescuing three drowning men  when his son andrew was three  polly johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family  her occupation was then looked down on  as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied  there were even rumors that andrew  who did not resemble his brother or sister  had been fathered by another man  polly johnson eventually remarried  to turner doughtry  who was as poor as she was 

johnson s mother apprenticed her son william to a tailor  james selby  andrew also became an apprentice in selby s shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his   st birthday  johnson lived with his mother for part of his service  and one of selby s employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills  his education was augmented by citizens who would come to selby s shop to read to the tailors as they worked  even before he became an apprentice  johnson came to listen  the readings caused a lifelong love of learning  and one of his biographers  annette gordon reed  suggests that johnson  later a gifted public speaker  learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth 

johnson was not happy at james selby s  and after about five years  both he and his brother ran away  selby responded by placing a reward for their return   ten dollars reward  ran away from the subscriber  two apprentice boys  legally bound  named william and andrew johnson       payment  to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in raleigh  or i will give the above reward for andrew johnson alone   the brothers went to carthage  north carolina  where andrew johnson worked as a tailor for several months  fearing he would be arrested and returned to raleigh  johnson moved to laurens  south carolina  he found work quickly  met his first love  mary wood  and made her a quilt as a gift  however  she rejected his marriage proposal  he returned to raleigh  hoping to buy out his apprenticeship  but could not come to terms with selby  unable to stay in raleigh  where he risked being apprehended for abandoning selby  he decided to move west 

johnson left north carolina for tennessee  traveling mostly on foot  after a brief period in knoxville  he moved to mooresville  alabama  he then worked as a tailor in columbia  tennessee  but was called back to raleigh by his mother and stepfather  who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west  johnson and his party traveled through the blue ridge mountains to greeneville  tennessee  andrew johnson fell in love with the town at first sight  and when he became prosperous purchased the land where he had first camped and planted a tree in commemoration 

in greeneville  johnson established a successful tailoring business in the front of his home  in       at the age of     he married    year old eliza mccardle  the daughter of a local shoemaker  the pair were married by justice of the peace mordecai lincoln  first cousin of thomas lincoln  whose son would become president  the johnsons were married for almost    years and had five children  martha         charles         mary         robert         and andrew jr          though she suffered from tuberculosis  eliza supported her husband s endeavors  she taught him mathematics skills and tutored him to improve his writing  shy and retiring by nature  eliza johnson usually remained in greeneville during johnson s political rise  she was not often seen during her husband s presidency  their daughter martha usually served as official hostess 

johnson s tailoring business prospered during the early years of the marriage  enabling him to hire help and giving him the funds to invest profitably in real estate  he later boasted of his talents as a tailor   my work never ripped or gave way   he was a voracious reader  books about famous orators aroused his interest in political dialogue  and he had private debates on the issues of the day with customers who held opposing views  he also took part in debates at greeneville college 

johnson helped organize a mechanics   working men s  ticket in the      greeneville municipal election  he was elected town alderman  along with his friends blackston mcdannel and mordecai lincoln  following the      nat turner slave rebellion  a state convention was called to pass a new constitution  including provisions to disenfranchise free people of color  the convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates  and provide ways of funding improvements to tennessee s infrastructure  the constitution was submitted for a public vote  and johnson spoke widely for its adoption  the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure  on january          his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of greeneville 
in       johnson made a bid for election to the  floater  seat which greene county shared with neighboring washington county in the tennessee house of representatives  according to his biographer  hans l  trefousse  johnson  demolished  the opposition in debate and won the election with almost a two to one margin  soon after taking his seat  johnson purchased his first slave  dolly  aged     dolly had three children over the years  johnson had the reputation of treating his slaves kindly  and the fact that dolly was dark skinned  and her offspring much lighter  led to speculation both during and after his lifetime that he was the father  during his greeneville days  johnson joined the tennessee militia as a member of the   th regiment  he attained the rank of colonel  though while an enrolled member  johnson was fined for an unknown offense  afterwards  he was often addressed or referred to by his rank 

in his first term in the legislature  which met in the state capital of nashville  johnson did not consistently vote with either the democratic or the newly formed whig party  though he revered president andrew jackson  a democrat and fellow tennessean  the major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals  with the party system in a state of flux  the whig party had organized in opposition to jackson  fearing the concentration of power in the executive branch of the government  johnson differed from the whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads  while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation  after brookins campbell and the whigs defeated johnson for reelection in       johnson would not lose another race for thirty years  in       he sought to regain his seat  initially as a whig  but when another candidate sought the whig nomination  he ran as a democrat and was elected  from that time he supported the democratic party and built a powerful political machine in greene county  johnson became a strong advocate of the democratic party  noted for his oratory  and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it  people flocked to hear him 

in       johnson was selected as a presidential elector for tennessee  giving him more statewide publicity  although democratic president martin van buren was defeated by former ohio senator william henry harrison  johnson was instrumental in keeping tennessee and greene county in the democratic column  he was elected to the tennessee senate in       where he served a two year term  he had achieved financial success in his tailoring business  but sold it to concentrate on politics  he had also acquired additional real estate  including a larger home and a farm  where his mother and stepfather took residence   and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves 

having served in both houses of the state legislature  johnson saw election to congress as the next step in his political career  he engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain democratic support  including the displacement of the whig postmaster in greeneville  and defeated jonesborough lawyer john a  aiken by       votes to        in washington  he joined a new democratic majority in the house of representatives  johnson advocated for the interests of the poor  maintained an anti abolitionist stance  argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs  with eliza remaining in greeneville  congressman johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the library of congress  although a fellow tennessee democrat  james k  polk  was elected president in       and johnson had campaigned for him  the two men had difficult relations  and president polk refused some of his patronage suggestions 

johnson believed  as did many southern democrats  that the constitution protected private property  including slaves  and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery  he won a second term in      against wiliam g  brownlow  presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy  in his second term  johnson supported the polk administration s decision to fight the mexican war  seen by some northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward  and opposed the wilmot proviso  a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from mexico  he introduced for the first time his homestead bill  to grant to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it  this issue was especially important to johnson because of his own humble beginnings 

in the presidential election of       the democrats split over the slavery issue  and abolitionists formed the free soil party  with former president van buren as their nominee  johnson supported the democratic candidate  former michigan senator lewis cass  with the party split  whig nominee general zachary taylor was easily victorious  and carried tennessee  johnson s relations with polk remained poor  the president recorded of his final new year s reception in      that

johnson  due to national interest in new railroad construction and in response to the need for better transportation in his own district  also supported government assistance for the east tennessee and virginia railroad 
in his campaign for a fourth term  johnson concentrated on three issues  slavery  homesteads and judicial elections  he defeated his opponent  nathaniel g  taylor  in august       with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns  when the house convened in december  the party division caused by the free soil party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a speaker  johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a speaker by a plurality  some weeks later others took up a similar proposal  and democrat howell cobb was elected 

once the speaker election had concluded and congress was ready to conduct legislative business  the issue of slavery took center stage  northerners sought to admit california  a free state  to the union  kentucky s henry clay introduced in the senate a series of resolutions  the compromise of       to admit california and pass legislation sought by each side  johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of slavery in the nation s capital  he pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators  then elected by state legislatures  and of the president  chosen by the electoral college   and limiting the tenure of federal judges to    years  these were all defeated 

a group of democrats nominated landon carter haynes to oppose johnson as he sought a fifth term  the whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own  the campaign included fierce debates  johnson s main issue was the passage of the homestead bill  haynes contended it would facilitate abolition  johnson won the election by more than      votes  though he was not enamored of the party s presidential nominee in       former new hampshire senator franklin pierce  johnson campaigned for him  pierce was elected  but he failed to carry tennessee  in       johnson managed to get the house to pass his homestead bill  but it failed in the senate  the whigs had gained control of the tennessee legislature  and  under the leadership of gustavus henry  redrew the boundaries of johnson s first district to make it a safe seat for their party  the  nashville union  termed this  henry mandering   lamented johnson   i have no political future  

if johnson considered retiring from politics upon deciding not to seek reelection  he soon changed his mind  his political friends began to maneuver to get him the nomination for governor  the democratic convention unanimously named him  though some party members were not happy at his selection  the whigs had won the past two gubernatorial elections  and still controlled the legislature  that party nominated henry  making the  henry mandering  of the first district an immediate issue  the two men debated in county seats the length of tennessee before the meetings were called off two weeks before the august      election due to illness in henry s family  johnson won the election by        votes to         some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support whig nathaniel taylor for his old seat in congress 

tennessee s governor had little power  johnson could propose legislation but not veto it  and most appointments were made by the whig controlled legislature  nevertheless  the office was a  bully pulpit  that allowed him to publicize himself and his political views  he succeeded in getting the appointments he wanted in return for his endorsement of john bell  a whig  for one of the state s u s  senate seats  in his first biennial speech  johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system  abolition of the bank of tennessee  and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures  the last was passed  johnson was critical of the tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes  either statewide or county by county   a mixture of the two was passed  reforms carried out during johnson s time as governor included the foundation of the state s public library  making books available to all  and its first public school system  and the initiation of regular state fairs to benefit craftsmen and farmers 

although the whig party was on its final decline nationally  it remained strong in tennessee  and the outlook for democrats there in      was poor  feeling that reelection as governor was necessary to give him a chance at the higher offices he sought  johnson agreed to make the run  meredith p  gentry received the whig nomination  a series of more than a dozen vitriolic debates ensued  the issues in the campaign were slavery  the prohibition of alcohol  and the nativist positions of the know nothing party  johnson favored the first  but opposed the others  gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question  and had gained the support of the know nothings  a group johnson portrayed as a secret society  johnson was unexpectedly victorious  albeit with a narrower margin than in      

when the presidential election of      approached  johnson hoped to be nominated  some tennessee county conventions designated him a  favorite son   his position that the best interests of the union were served by slavery in some areas made him a practical compromise candidate for president  he was never a major contender  the nomination fell to former pennsylvania senator james buchanan  though he was not impressed by either  johnson campaigned for buchanan and his running mate  john c  breckinridge  who were elected 

johnson decided not to seek a third term as governor  with an eye towards election to the u s  senate  in       while returning from washington  his train derailed  causing serious damage to his right arm  this injury would trouble him in the years to come 

the victors in the      state legislative campaign would  once they convened in october  elect a united states senator  former whig governor william b  campbell wrote to his uncle   the great anxiety of the whigs is to elect a majority in the legislature so as to defeat andrew johnson for senator  should the democrats have the majority  he will certainly be their choice  and there is no man living to whom the americans and whigs have as much antipathy as johnson   the governor spoke widely in the campaign  and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature  johnson s final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors  and he made proposals popular among democrats  two days later the legislature elected him to the senate  the opposition was appalled  with the richmond  whig  newspaper referring to him as  the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the union  

johnson gained high office due to his proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and self employed tradesmen who made up much of tennessee s electorate  he called them the  plebeians   he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state democratic party  but none could match him as a vote getter  after his death  one tennessee voter wrote of him   johnson was always the same to everyone      the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen   always seen in impeccably tailored clothing  he cut an impressive figure  and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate  mostly denied the party s machinery  he relied on a network of friends  advisers  and contacts  one friend  hugh douglas  stated in a letter to him   you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time  at heart many of us never wanted you to be governor only none of the rest of us could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you  then we did not want you to go to the senate but  the people would send you   

the new senator took his seat when congress convened in december       the term of his predecessor  james c  jones  had expired in march   he came to washington as usual without his wife and family  eliza would visit washington only once during johnson s first time as senator  in       johnson immediately set about introducing the homestead bill in the senate  but as most senators who supported it were northern  many associated with the newly founded republican party   the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue  southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the homestead bill were more likely to be northern non slaveholders  the issue of slavery had been complicated by the supreme court s ruling earlier in the year in  dred scott v  sandford  that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories  johnson  a slaveholding senator from a southern state  made a major speech in the senate the following may in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the homestead bill and slavery were not incompatible  nevertheless  southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation           in       it failed on a procedural vote when vice president breckinridge broke a tie against the bill  and in       a watered down version passed both houses  only to be vetoed by buchanan at the urging of southerners  johnson continued his opposition to spending  chairing a committee to control it 

he argued against funding to build infrastructure in washington  d c   stating that it was unfair to expect state citizens to pay for the city s streets  even if it was the seat of government  he opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the mormons in utah territory  arguing for temporary volunteers as the united states should not have a standing army 

in october       abolitionist john brown and sympathizers raided the federal arsenal at harpers ferry  virginia  today west virginia   tensions in washington between pro  and anti slavery forces increased greatly  johnson gave a major speech in the senate in december  decrying northerners who would endanger the union by seeking to outlaw slavery  the tennessee senator stated that  all men are created equal  from the declaration of independence did not apply to african americans  since the constitution of illinois contained that phrase   and that document barred voting by african americans  johnson  by this time  was a wealthy man who owned a few household slaves     slaves  according to the      federal census 

johnson hoped that he would be a compromise candidate for the presidential nomination as the democratic party tore itself apart over the slavery question  busy with the homestead bill during the      democratic national convention in charleston  south carolina  he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom deal making  the convention deadlocked  with no candidate able to gain the required two thirds vote  but the sides were too far apart to consider johnson as a compromise  the party split  with northerners backing illinois senator stephen douglas while southerners  including johnson  supported vice president breckinridge for president  with former tennessee senator john bell running a fourth party candidacy and further dividing the vote  the republican party elected its first president  former illinois representative abraham lincoln  the election of lincoln  known to be against the spread of slavery  was unacceptable to many in the south  although secession from the union had not been an issue in the campaign  talk of it began in the southern states 

johnson took to the senate floor after the election  giving a speech well received in the north   i will not give up this government      no  i intend to stand by it      and i invite every man who is a patriot to      rally around the altar of our common country      and swear by our god  and all that is sacred and holy  that the constitution shall be saved  and the union preserved   as southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded  he reminded mississippi senator jefferson davis that if southerners would only hold to their seats  the democrats would control the senate  and could defend the south s interests against any infringement by lincoln  gordon reed points out that while johnson s belief in an indissoluble union was sincere  he had alienated southern leaders  including davis  who would soon be the president of the confederate states of america  formed by the seceding states  if the tennessean had backed the confederacy  he would have had small influence in its government 

johnson returned home when his state took up the issue of secession  his successor as governor  isham g  harris  and the legislature organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession  when that failed  they put the question of leaving the union to a popular vote  despite threats on johnson s life  and actual assaults  he campaigned against both questions  sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him  although johnson s eastern region of tennessee was largely against secession  the second referendum passed  and in june       tennessee joined the confederacy  believing he would be killed if he stayed  johnson fled through the cumberland gap  where his party was in fact shot at  he left his wife and family in greeneville 

as the only member from a seceded state to remain in the senate and the most prominent southern unionist  johnson had lincoln s ear in the early months of the war  with most of tennessee in confederate hands  johnson spent congressional recesses in kentucky and ohio  trying in vain to convince any union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into east tennessee 

johnson s first tenure in the senate came to a conclusion in march      when lincoln appointed him military governor of tennessee  much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered  although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the confederates were defeated in an area  lincoln chose to use his power as commander in chief to appoint military governors over union controlled southern regions  the senate quickly confirmed johnson s nomination along with the rank of brigadier general  in response  the confederates confiscated his land and his slaves  and turned his home into a military hospital  later in       after his departure from the senate and in the absence of most southern legislators  the homestead bill was finally enacted  along with legislation for land grant colleges and for the transcontinental railroad  the homestead bill has been credited with opening the american west to settlement 

as military governor  johnson sought to eliminate rebel influence in the state  he demanded loyalty oaths from public officials  and shut down all newspapers owned by confederate sympathizers  much of eastern tennessee remained in confederate hands  and the ebb and flow of war during      sometimes brought confederate control again close to nashville  however  the confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him  johnson undertook the defense of nashville as well as he could  though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by general nathan bedford forrest  relief from union regulars did not come until william s  rosecrans defeated the confederates at murfreesboro in early       much of eastern tennessee was captured later that year 

when lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation in january       declaring freedom for all slaves in confederate held areas  he exempted tennessee at johnson s request  the proclamation increased the debate over what should become of the slaves after the war  as not all unionists supported abolition  johnson finally decided that slavery had to end  he wrote   if the institution of slavery      seeks to overthrow it  the government   then the government has a clear right to destroy it   he reluctantly supported efforts to enlist former slaves into the union army  feeling that african americans should perform menial tasks to release white americans to do the fighting  nevertheless  he succeeded in recruiting        black soldiers to serve the union 

in       lincoln s running mate had been maine senator hannibal hamlin  vice president hamlin had served competently  was in good health  and was willing to run again  nevertheless  johnson emerged as running mate for lincoln s reelection bid in      

lincoln considered several war democrats for the ticket in       and sent an agent to sound out general benjamin butler as a possible running mate  in may       the president dispatched general daniel sickles to nashville on a fact finding mission  although sickles denied he was there either to investigate or interview the military governor  johnson biographer hans l  trefousse believes sickles s trip was connected to johnson s subsequent nomination for vice president  according to historian albert castel in his account of johnson s presidency  lincoln was impressed by johnson s administration of tennessee  gordon reed points out that while the lincoln hamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in        having johnson  the  southern  war democrat  on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country   another factor was the desire of secretary of state william seward to frustrate the vice presidential candidacy of his fellow new yorker  former senator daniel s  dickinson  a war democrat  as seward would probably have had to yield his place if another new yorker became vice president  johnson  once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of sickles  visit  was active on his own behalf  giving speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy 

to sound a theme of unity  lincoln in      ran under the banner of the national union party  rather than the republicans  at the party s convention in baltimore in june  lincoln was easily nominated  although there had been some talk of replacing him with a cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals  after the convention backed lincoln  former secretary of war simon cameron offered a resolution to nominate hamlin  but it was defeated  johnson was nominated for vice president by c m  allen of indiana with an iowa delegate as seconder  on the first ballot  johnson led with     votes to     for hamlin and     for dickinson  on the second ballot  kentucky switched to vote for johnson  beginning a stampede  johnson was named on the second ballot with     votes to hamlin s    and eight for dickinson  the nomination was made unanimous  lincoln expressed pleasure at the result   andy johnson  i think  is a good man   when word reached nashville  a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the union 

although it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign  johnson gave a number of speeches in tennessee  kentucky  ohio  and indiana  he also sought to boost his chances in tennessee while reestablishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive  in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the confederacy  the democratic candidate for president  george mcclellan  hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation  and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters  lincoln declined to override johnson  and their ticket took the state by        votes  congress refused to count tennessee s electoral votes  but lincoln and johnson did not need them  having won in most states that had voted  and easily secured the election 

now vice president elect  johnson was anxious to complete the work of reestablishing civilian government in tennessee  although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after inauguration day  march    he hoped to remain in nashville to complete his task  but was told by lincoln s advisers that he could not stay  but would be sworn in with lincoln  in these months  union troops finished the retaking of eastern tennessee  including greeneville  just before his departure  the voters of tennessee ratified a new constitution  abolishing slavery  on february           one of johnson s final acts as military governor was to certify the results 

johnson traveled to washington to be sworn in  although according to gordon reed   in light of what happened on march          it might have been better if johnson had stayed in nashville   he may have been ill  castel cited typhoid fever  though gordon reed notes that there is no independent evidence for that diagnosis  on the evening of march    johnson attended a party in his honor  he drank heavily  hung over the following morning at the capitol  he asked vice president hamlin for some whiskey  hamlin produced a bottle  and johnson took two stiff drinks  stating  i need all the strength for the occasion i can have   in the senate chamber  johnson delivered a rambling address as lincoln  the congress  and dignitaries looked on  almost incoherent at times  he finally meandered to a halt  whereupon hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president  lincoln  who had watched sadly during the debacle  then went to his own swearing in outside the capitol  and delivered his acclaimed second inaugural address 

in the weeks after the inauguration  johnson only presided over the senate briefly  and hid from public ridicule at the maryland home of a friend  francis preston blair  when he did return to washington  it was with the intent of leaving for tennessee to reestablish his family in greeneville  instead  he remained after word came that general ulysses s  grant had captured the confederate capital of richmond  virginia  presaging the end of the war  lincoln stated  in response to criticism of johnson s behavior  that  i have known andy johnson for many years  he made a bad slip the other day  but you need not be scared  andy ain t a drunkard  

on the afternoon of april           lincoln and johnson met for the first time since the inauguration  trefousse states that johnson wanted to  induce lincoln not to be too lenient with traitors   gordon reed agrees 

that night  president lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by john wilkes booth  a confederate sympathizer  the shooting of the president was part of a conspiracy to assassinate lincoln  johnson  and seward the same night  seward barely survived his wounds  while johnson escaped attack as his would be assassin  george atzerodt  got drunk instead of killing the vice president  leonard j  farwell  a fellow boarder at the kirkwood house  awoke johnson with news of lincoln s shooting at ford s theatre  johnson rushed to the president s deathbed  where he remained a short time  on his return promising   they shall suffer for this  they shall suffer for this   lincoln died at       am the next morning  johnson s swearing in occurred between    and     am with chief justice salmon p  chase presiding in the presence of most of the cabinet  johnson s demeanor was described by the newspapers as  solemn and dignified   some cabinet members had last seen johnson  apparently drunk  at the inauguration  at noon  johnson conducted his first cabinet meeting in the treasury secretary s office  and asked all members to remain in their positions 

the events of the assassination resulted in speculation  then and subsequently  concerning johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him  in the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture  atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy  but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of johnson was merely a ruse  conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination  booth came to the kirkwood house and left one of his cards  this object was received by johnson s private secretary  william a  browning  with an inscription   don t wish to disturb you  are you at home  j  wilkes booth  

johnson presided with dignity over lincoln s funeral ceremonies in washington  before his predecessor s body was sent home to springfield  illinois  for interment  shortly after lincoln s death  union general william t  sherman reported he had  without consulting washington  reached an armistice agreement with confederate general joseph e  johnston for the surrender of confederate forces in north carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power  with private property rights to be respected  this did not even acknowledge the freedom of those in slavery  this was not acceptable to johnson or the cabinet who sent word for sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals  which he did  further  johnson placed a          bounty  equivalent to   in   on confederate president davis  then a fugitive  which gave him the reputation of a man who would be tough on the south  more controversially  he permitted the execution of mary surratt for her part in lincoln s assassination  surratt was executed with three others  including atzerodt  on july         

upon taking office  johnson faced the question of what to do with the confederacy  president lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in virginia  arkansas  louisiana  and tennessee as the union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the union  congress considered this too lenient  its own plan  requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath  passed both houses in       but lincoln pocket vetoed it 

johnson had three goals in reconstruction  he sought a speedy restoration of the states  on the grounds that they had never truly left the union  and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government  to johnson  african american suffrage was a delay and a distraction  it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote  second  political power in the southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved  plebeians   johnson feared that the freedmen  many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters  might vote at their direction  johnson s third priority was election in his own right in       a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish  attempting to secure a democratic anti congressional reconstruction coalition in the south 

the republicans had formed a number of factions  the radical republicans sought voting and other civil rights for african americans  they believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote republican in gratitude for emancipation  and that black votes could keep the republicans in power and southern democrats  including former rebels  out of influence  they believed that top confederates should be punished  the moderate republicans sought to keep the democrats out of power at a national level  and prevent former rebels from resuming power  they were not as enthusiastic about the idea of african american suffrage as their radical colleagues  either because of their own local political concerns  or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly  northern democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the southern states  they did not support african american suffrage  which might threaten democratic control in the south 

johnson was initially left to devise a reconstruction policy without legislative intervention  as congress was not due to meet again until december       radical republicans told the president that the southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the union  but johnson  with the support of other officials including seward  insisted that the franchise was a state  not a federal matter  the cabinet was divided on the issue 

johnson s first reconstruction actions were two proclamations  with the unanimous backing of his cabinet  on may     one recognized the virginia government led by provisional governor francis pierpont  the second provided amnesty for all ex rebels except those holding property valued at         or more  it also appointed a temporary governor for north carolina and authorized elections  neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding black suffrage or freedmen s rights  the president ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states 

as southern states began the process of forming governments  johnson s policies received considerable public support in the north  which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the south  while he received such support from the white south  he underestimated the determination of northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing  it was important  in northern public opinion  that the south acknowledge its defeat  that slavery be ended  and that the lot of african americans be improved  voting rights were less important   after all  only a handful of northern states  mostly in new england  gave african american men the right to vote on the same basis as whites  and in late       connecticut  wisconsin  and minnesota voted down african american suffrage proposals by large margins  northern public opinion tolerated johnson s inaction on black suffrage as an experiment  to be allowed if it quickened southern acceptance of defeat  instead  white southerners felt emboldened  a number of southern states passed black codes  binding african american laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit  and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor  most southerners elected to congress were former confederates  with the most prominent being georgia senator designate and former confederate vice president alexander stephens  congress assembled in early december       johnson s conciliatory annual message to them was well received  nevertheless  congress refused to seat the southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate reconstruction legislation 

northerners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant confederate leaders  such as stephens  rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw  they saw the black codes placing african americans in a position barely above slavery  republicans also feared that restoration of the southern states would return the democrats to power  in addition  according to david o  stewart in his book on johnson s impeachment   the violence and poverty that oppressed the south would galvanize the opposition to johnson  

congress was reluctant to confront the president  and initially only sought to fine tune johnson s policies towards the south  according to trefousse   if there was a time when johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the republican party  it was the period following the return of congress   the president was unhappy about the provocative actions of the southern states  and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there  but made no statement publicly  believing that southerners had a right to act as they did  even if it was unwise to do so  by late january       he was convinced that winning a showdown with the radical republicans was necessary to his political plans     both for the success of reconstruction and for reelection in       he would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise african americans in the district of columbia  a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all white referendum  a bill to accomplish this passed the house of representatives  but to johnson s disappointment  stalled in the senate before he could veto it 

illinois senator lyman trumbull  leader of the moderate republicans and chairman of the judiciary committee  was anxious to reach an understanding with the president  he ushered through congress a bill extending the freedmen s bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in       and the first civil rights bill  to grant citizenship to the freedmen  trumbull met several times with johnson  and was convinced the president would sign the measures  johnson rarely contradicted visitors  often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord   in fact  the president opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty  additionally  both of trumbull s bills were unpopular among white southerners  whom johnson hoped to include in his new party  johnson vetoed the freedman s bureau bill on february           to the delight of white southerners and the puzzled anger of republican legislators  he considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the senate the following day  johnson believed that the radicals would now be isolated and defeated  and that the moderate republicans would form behind him  he did not understand that moderates too wanted to see african americans treated fairly 

on february           washington s birthday  johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the white house and called for an address in honor of the first president  in his hour long speech  he instead referred to himself over     times  more damagingly  he also spoke of  men      still opposed to the union  to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the south  when called upon by the crowd to say who they were  johnson named pennsylvania congressman thaddeus stevens  massachusetts senator charles sumner  and abolitionist wendell phillips  and accused them of plotting his assassination  republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war  while one democratic ally estimated johnson s speech cost the party         votes in the      congressional midterm elections 

although strongly urged by moderates to sign the civil rights bill  johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on march     in his veto message  he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when    out of    states were unrepresented in the congress  and that it discriminated in favor of african americans and against whites  within three weeks  congress had overridden his veto  the first time that had been done on a major bill in american history  the veto of the civil rights act of       often seen as a key mistake of johnson s presidency  convinced moderates there was no hope of working with him  historian eric foner in his volume on reconstruction views it as  the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career   according to stewart  the veto was  for many his defining blunder  setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency  

congress also proposed the fourteenth amendment to the states  written by trumbull and others  it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part  though johnson opposed it  the amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the civil rights act into the constitution  but also went further  the amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the united states  except indians on reservations   penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen  and most importantly  created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts  it also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of confederate war debts  further  it disqualified many former confederates from office  although the disability could be removed   by congress  not the president  both houses passed the freedmen s bureau act a second time  and again the president vetoed it  this time  the veto was overridden  by the summer of       when congress finally adjourned  johnson s method of restoring states to the union by executive fiat  without safeguards for the freedmen  was in deep trouble  his home state of tennessee ratified the fourteenth amendment despite the president s opposition  when tennessee did so  congress immediately seated its proposed delegation  embarrassing johnson 

efforts to compromise failed  and a political war ensued between the united republicans on one side  and on the other  johnson and his allies in the democratic party  north and south  he called a convention of the national union party  republicans had returned to using their previous identifier  johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full term  in       the battleground was the election of       southern states were not allowed to vote  johnson campaigned vigorously  undertaking a public speaking tour  known as the  swing around the circle   the trip  including speeches in chicago  st  louis  indianapolis and columbus  proved politically disastrous  with the president making controversial comparisons between himself and christ  and engaging in arguments with hecklers  these exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency  the republicans won by a landslide  increasing their two thirds majority in congress  and made plans to control reconstruction  johnson blamed the democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the national union movement 

even with the republican victory in november       johnson considered himself in a strong position  the fourteenth amendment had been ratified by none of the southern or border states except tennessee  and had been rejected in kentucky  delaware  and maryland  as the amendment required ratification by three quarters of the states to become part of the constitution  he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor  leading to his election in       once it reconvened in december       an energized congress began passing legislation  often over a presidential veto  this included the district of columbia voting bill  congress admitted nebraska to the union over a veto  and the republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment  johnson s veto of a bill for statehood for colorado territory was sustained  enough senators agreed that a district with a population of        was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day 

in january       congressman stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts  under martial law  the states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions  african americans could vote for or become delegates  former confederates could not  in the legislative process  congress added to the bill that restoration to the union would follow the state s ratification of the fourteenth amendment  and completion of the process of adding it to the constitution  johnson and the southerners attempted a compromise  whereby the south would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former confederates  and for limited black suffrage  the republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment  and the deal fell through  although johnson could have pocket vetoed the first reconstruction act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the thirty ninth congress  he chose to veto it directly on march          congress overruled him the same day  also on march    congress passed the tenure of office act over the president s veto  in response to statements during the swing around the circle that he planned to fire cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him  this bill  requiring senate approval for the firing of cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards  was immediately controversial  with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to johnson  whose key cabinet officers were lincoln holdovers 

secretary of war edwin stanton was an able and hard working man  but difficult to deal with  johnson both admired and was exasperated by his war secretary  who  in combination with general of the army grant  worked to undermine the president s southern policy from within his own administration  johnson considered firing stanton  but respected him for his wartime service as secretary  stanton  for his part  feared allowing johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign  despite his public disagreements with his president 

the new congress met for a few weeks in march       then adjourned  leaving the house committee on the judiciary behind  charged with reporting back to the full house whether there were grounds for johnson to be impeached  this committee duly met  examined the president s bank accounts  and summoned members of the cabinet to testify  when a federal court released former confederate president davis on bail on may     he had been captured shortly after the war   the committee investigated whether the president had impeded the prosecution  it learned that johnson was eager to have davis tried  a bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges  the committee adjourned on june   

later in june  johnson and stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the south could override the civil authorities  the president had attorney general henry stanbery issue an opinion backing his position that they could not  johnson sought to pin down stanton either as for  and thus endorsing johnson s position  or against  showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the cabinet  stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications  when congress reconvened in july  it passed a reconstruction act against johnson s position  waited for his veto  overruled it  and went home  in addition to clarifying the powers of the generals  the legislation also deprived the president of control over the army in the south  with congress in recess until november  johnson decided to fire stanton and relieve one of the military commanders  general philip sheridan  who had dismissed the governor of texas and installed a replacement with little popular support  johnson was initially deterred by a strong objection from grant  but on august    the president demanded stanton s resignation  the secretary refused to quit with congress out of session  johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of congress as permitted under the tenure of office act  grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the army 

grant  under protest  followed johnson s order transferring sheridan and another of the district commanders  daniel sickles  who had angered johnson by firmly following congress s plan  the president also issued a proclamation pardoning most confederates  exempting those who held office under the confederacy  or who had served in federal office before the war and had breached their oaths  although republicans expressed anger with his actions  the      elections generally went democratic  no seats in congress were directly elected in the polling  but the democrats took control of the ohio general assembly  allowing them to defeat for reelection one of johnson s strongest opponents  senator benjamin wade  voters in ohio  connecticut  and minnesota turned down propositions to grant african americans the vote 

the adverse results momentarily put a stop to republican calls to impeach johnson  who was elated by the elections  nevertheless  once congress met in november  the judiciary committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against johnson  after much debate about whether anything the president had done was a high crime or misdemeanor  the standard under the constitution  the resolution was defeated by the house of representatives on december          by a vote of    in favor to     opposed 

johnson notified congress of stanton s suspension and grant s interim appointment  in january       the senate disapproved of his action  and reinstated stanton  contending the president had violated the tenure of office act  grant stepped aside over johnson s objection  causing a complete break between them  johnson then dismissed stanton and appointed lorenzo thomas to replace him  stanton refused to leave his office  and on february           the house impeached the president for intentionally violating the tenure of office act  by a vote of     to     the house subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment  for the most part alleging that he had violated the tenure of office act  and had questioned the legitimacy of congress 

on march          the impeachment trial began in the senate and lasted almost three months  congressmen george s  boutwell  benjamin butler and thaddeus stevens acted as managers for the house  or prosecutors  and william m  evarts  benjamin r  curtis and former attorney general stanbery were johnson s counsel  chief justice chase served as presiding judge 

the defense relied on the provision of the tenure of office act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration  since lincoln had appointed stanton  the defense maintained johnson had not violated the act  and also argued that the president had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of congress  johnson s counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial  nor publicly comment about the proceedings  and except for a pair of interviews in april  he complied 

johnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal  for example  he pledged to iowa senator james w  grimes that he would not interfere with congress s reconstruction efforts  grimes reported to a group of moderates  many of whom voted for acquittal  that he believed the president would keep his word  johnson also promised to install the respected john schofield as war secretary  kansas senator edmund g  ross received assurances that the new  radical influenced constitutions ratified in south carolina and arkansas would be transmitted to the congress without delay  an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal 

one reason senators were reluctant to remove the president was that his successor would have been ohio senator wade  the president  pro tempore  of the senate  wade  a lame duck who left office in early       was a radical who supported such measures as women s suffrage  placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation  additionally  a president wade was seen as an obstacle to grant s ambitions 

with the dealmaking  johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict  and in the days leading up to the ballot  newspapers reported that stevens and his radicals had given up  on may     the senate voted on the   th article of impeachment  accusing johnson of firing stanton in violation of the tenure of office of act once the senate had overturned his suspension  thirty five senators voted  guilty  and     not guilty   thus falling short by a single vote of the two thirds majority required for conviction under the constitution  seven republicans   senators grimes  ross  trumbull  william pitt fessenden  joseph s  fowler  john b  henderson  and peter g  van winkle   voted to acquit the president  with stevens bitterly disappointed at the result  the senate then adjourned for the republican national convention  grant was nominated for president  the senate returned on may    and voted on the second and third articles  with identical         results  faced with those results  johnson s opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings  stanton  relinquished  his office on may     and the senate subsequently confirmed schofield  when johnson renominated stanbery to return to his position as attorney general after his service as a defense manager  the senate refused to confirm him 

allegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial  even when it was in progress  representative butler began an investigation  held contentious hearings  and issued a report  unendorsed by any other congressman  butler focused on a new york   based  astor house group   supposedly led by political boss and editor thurlow weed  this organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through cincinnati lawyer charles woolley to bribe senators to acquit johnson  butler went so far as to imprison woolley in the capitol building when he refused to answer questions  but failed to prove bribery 

soon after taking office as president  johnson reached an accord with secretary of state william h  seward that there would be no change in foreign policy  in practice  this meant that seward would continue to run things as he had under lincoln  seward and lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in       the victor hoped that seward would succeed him as president in       at the time of johnson s accession  the french had intervened in mexico  sending troops there  while many politicians had indulged in saber rattling over the mexican matter  seward preferred quiet diplomacy  warning the french through diplomatic channels that their presence in mexico was not acceptable  although the president preferred a more aggressive approach  seward persuaded him to follow his lead  in april       the french government informed seward that its troops would be brought home in stages  to conclude by november      

seward was an expansionist  and sought opportunities to gain territory for the united states  by       the russian government saw its north american colony  today alaska  as a financial liability  and feared losing control as american settlement reached there  it instructed its minister in washington  baron eduard de stoeckl  to negotiate a sale  de stoeckl did so deftly  getting seward to raise his offer from    million  coincidentally  the minimum that russia had instructed de stoeckl to accept  to    million  and then getting          added by raising various objections  this sum of      million is equivalent to   in present day terms  on march           de stoeckl and seward signed the treaty  working quickly as the senate was about to adjourn  johnson and seward took the signed document to the president s room in the capitol  only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment  the president summoned the senate into session to meet on april    that body approved the treaty          emboldened by his success in alaska  seward sought acquisitions elsewhere  his only success was staking an american claim to uninhabited wake island in the pacific  which would be officially claimed by the u s  in       he came close with the danish west indies as denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite  but the senate never voted on the treaty and it expired 

another treaty that fared badly was the johnson clarendon convention  negotiated in settlement of the  alabama  claims  for damages to american shipping from british built confederate raiders  negotiated by the united states minister to britain  former maryland senator reverdy johnson  in late       it was ignored by the senate during the remainder of the president s term  the treaty was rejected after he left office  and the grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from britain 

johnson appointed nine article iii federal judges during his presidency  all to united states district courts  he did not appoint a justice to serve on the supreme court  in april       he nominated henry stanbery to fill the vacancy left with the death of john catron  but congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment  and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well  providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office  johnson appointed his greeneville crony  samuel milligan  to the united states court of claims  where he served from      until his death in      

in june       johnson signed the southern homestead act into law  believing that the legislation would assist poor whites  around        land claims were successfully patented  although few former slaves benefitted from the law  fraud was rampant  and much of the best land was off limits  reserved for grants to veterans or railroads  in june       johnson signed an eight hour law passed by congress that established an eight hour workday for laborers and mechanics employed by the federal government  although johnson told members of a workingmen s party delegation in baltimore that he could not directly commit himself to an eight hour day  he nevertheless told the same delegation that he greatly favoured the  shortest number of hours consistent with the interests of all   according to richard f  selcer  however  the good intentions behind the law were  immediately frustrated  as wages were cut by     

johnson sought nomination by the      democratic national convention in new york in july       he remained very popular among southern whites  and boosted that popularity by issuing  just before the convention  a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any confederate not already indicted  meaning that only davis and a few others still might face trial  on the first ballot  johnson was second to former ohio representative george h  pendleton  who had been his democratic opponent for vice president in       johnson s support was mostly from the south  and fell away as the ballots passed  on the   nd ballot  former new york governor horatio seymour was nominated  and the president received only four votes  all from tennessee 

the conflict with congress continued  johnson sent congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six year term and make the president and the senate directly elected  and for term limits for judges  congress took no action on them  when the president was slow to officially report ratifications of the fourteenth amendment by the new southern legislatures  congress passed a bill  again over his veto  requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt  he still delayed as much as he could  but was required  in july       to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the constitution 

seymour s operatives sought johnson s support  but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign  it was not until october  with the vote already having taken place in some states  that he mentioned seymour at all  and he never endorsed him  nevertheless  johnson regretted grant s victory  in part because of their animus from the stanton affair  in his annual message to congress in december  johnson urged the repeal of the tenure of office act and told legislators that had they admitted their southern colleagues in       all would have been well  he celebrated his   th birthday in late december with a party for several hundred children  though not including those of president elect grant  who did not allow his to go 

on christmas day       johnson issued a final amnesty  this one covering everyone  including davis  he also issued  in his final months in office  pardons for crimes  including one for dr  samuel mudd  controversially convicted of involvement in the lincoln assassination  he had set booth s broken leg  and imprisoned in on florida s dry tortugas 

on march    the president hosted a large public reception at the white house on his final full day in office  grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as johnson  as was customary  and johnson refused to go to the inauguration at all  despite an effort by seward to prompt a change of mind  he spent the morning of march   finishing last minute business  and then shortly after noon rode from the white house to the home of a friend 

after leaving the presidency  johnson remained for some weeks in washington  then returned to greeneville for the first time in eight years  he was honored with large public celebrations along the way  especially in tennessee  where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners  he had arranged to purchase a large farm near greeneville to live on after his presidency 

some expected johnson to run for governor of tennessee or for the senate again  while others that he would become a railroad executive  johnson found greeneville boring  and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son robert in       seeking vindication for himself  and revenge against his political enemies  he launched a senate bid soon after returning home  tennessee had gone republican  but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the ku klux klan kept down the african american vote  leading to a democratic victory in the legislative elections in august       johnson was seen as a likely victor in the senate election  although hated by radical republicans  and also by some democrats because of his wartime activities  although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislature s balloting  the republicans eventually elected henry cooper over johnson           in       there was a special election for an   johnson initially sought the democratic nomination  but when he saw that it would go to former confederate general benjamin f  cheatham  decided to run as an independent  the former president was defeated  finishing third  but the split in the democratic party defeated cheatham in favor of an old johnson unionist ally  horace maynard 

in       johnson contracted cholera during an epidemic but recovered  that year he lost about          when the first national bank of washington went under  though he was eventually repaid much of the sum  he began looking towards the next senate election  to take place in the legislature in early       johnson began to woo the farmers  grange movement  with his jeffersonian leanings  he easily gained their support  he spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour  few african americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as reconstruction faded in tennessee  setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other southern states  the white domination would last almost a century  in the tennessee legislative elections in august  the democrats elected    legislators to the republicans  eight  and johnson went to nashville for the legislative session  when the balloting for the senate seat began on january           he led with    votes  but did not have the required majority as three former confederate generals  one former colonel  and a former democratic congressman split the vote with him  johnson s opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him  but failed  and he was elected on january    on the   th ballot  with a margin of a single vote  nashville erupted in rejoicing  remarked johnson   thank god for the vindication  

johnson s comeback garnered national attention  with the  st  louis republican  calling it   the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of american politics can show   at his swearing in in the senate on march          he was greeted with flowers and sworn in with his predecessor as vice president  hamlin  by that office s current incumbent  henry wilson  who as senator had voted for his ousting  many republicans ignored senator johnson  though some  such as ohio s john sherman  who had voted for conviction   shook his hand  johnson remains the only former president to serve in the senate  he spoke only once in the short session  on march    lambasting president grant for his use of federal troops in support of louisiana s reconstruction government  the former president asked   how far off is military despotism   and concluded his speech   may god bless this people and god save the constitution  

johnson returned home after the special session concluded  in late july  convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the ohio gubernatorial race  he decided to travel there to give speeches  he began the trip on july     and broke the journey at his daughter mary s farm near elizabethton  where his daughter martha was also staying  that evening he suffered a stroke  but refused medical treatment until the next day  when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from elizabethton  he seemed to respond to their ministrations  but suffered another stroke on the evening of july     and died early the following morning at the age of     president grant had the  painful duty  of announcing the death of the only surviving past president  northern newspapers  in their obituaries  tended to focus on johnson s loyalty during the war  while southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president  johnson s funeral was held on august   in greeneville  he was buried with his body wrapped in an american flag and a copy of the u s  constitution placed under his head  according to his wishes  the burial ground was dedicated as the andrew johnson national cemetery in       and with his home and tailor s shop  is part of the andrew johnson national historic site 

according to castel   historians  of johnson s presidency  have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event  reconstruction    through the remainder of the   th century  there were few historical evaluations of johnson and his presidency  memoirs from northerners who had dealt with him  such as former vice president henry wilson and maine senator james g  blaine  depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the south in reconstruction  but who was frustrated by congress  according to historian howard k  beale in his journal article about the historiography of reconstruction   men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth  thus  alabama congressman and historian  hilary herbert and his corroborators presented a southern indictment of northern policies  and henry wilson s history was a brief for the north  

the turn of the   th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of johnson  leading the wave was pulitzer prize winning historian james ford rhodes  who wrote of the former president 

rhodes ascribed johnson s faults to his personal weaknesses  and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum south  other early   th century historians  such as john burgess  woodrow wilson  who later became president himself  and william dunning  all southerners  concurred with rhodes  believing johnson flawed and politically inept  but concluding that he had tried to carry out lincoln s plans for the south in good faith  author and journalist jay tolson suggests that wilson  depict ed reconstruction  as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists  the so called carpetbaggers  and cynical white southerners  or scalawags  who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain  
even as rhodes and his school wrote  another group of historians was setting out on the full rehabilitation of johnson  using for the first time primary sources such as his papers  provided by his daughter martha before her death in       and the diaries of johnson s navy secretary  gideon welles  first published in       the resulting volumes  such as david miller dewitt s  the impeachment and trial of president andrew johnson          presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him  in james schouler s       history of the reconstruction period   the author accused rhodes of being  quite unfair to johnson   though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves  these works had an effect  although historians continued to view johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency  they saw his reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct 

castel writes 

beale wondered in        is it not time that we studied the history of reconstruction without first assuming  at least subconsciously  that carpetbaggers and southern white republicans were wicked  that negroes were illiterate incompetents  and that the whole white south owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of  white supremacy    despite these doubts  the favorable view of johnson survived for a time  in       van heflin portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the hollywood film  tennessee johnson   in       a poll of his colleagues by historian arthur m  schlesinger deemed johnson among the average presidents  in       one by clinton l  rossiter named him as one of the near great chief executives  foner notes that at the time of these surveys   the reconstruction era that followed the civil war was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote  

earlier historians  including beale  believed that money drove events  and had seen reconstruction as an economic struggle  they also accepted  for the most part  that reconciliation between north and south should have been the top priority of reconstruction  in the     s  historians began to focus on the african american experience as central to reconstruction  they rejected completely any claim of black inferiority  which had marked many earlier historical works  and saw the developing civil rights movement as a second reconstruction  some writers stated they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights  these authors sympathized with the radical republicans for their desire to help the african american  and saw johnson as callous towards the freedman  in a number of works from      onwards by such historians as fawn brodie  the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman s lot  these volumes included major biographies of stevens and stanton  reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society 

in the early   st century  johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in u s  history  according to historian glenn w  lafantasie  who believes buchanan the worst president   johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachment      his complete mishandling of reconstruction policy      his bristling personality  and his enormous sense of self importance   tolson suggests that  johnson is now scorned for having resisted radical republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well being of the newly emancipated african americans   gordon reed notes that johnson  along with his contemporaries pierce and buchanan  are generally listed among the five worst presidents  but states   there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation  the problems these men had to confront were enormous  it would have taken a succession of lincolns to do them justice  

trefousse considers johnson s legacy to be  the maintenance of white supremacy  his boost to southern conservatives by undermining reconstruction was his legacy to the nation  one that would trouble the country for generations to come   gordon reed states of johnson

aleksandr solzhenitsyn

aleksandr isayevich solzhenitsyn       december            august       was a russian novelist  historian  and short story writer  he was an outspoken critic of the soviet union and communism and helped to raise global awareness of its gulag forced labor camp system  he was allowed to publish only one work in the soviet union   one day in the life of ivan denisovich          in the periodical  novy mir   after this he had to publish in the west  most notably  cancer ward           august               and  the gulag archipelago          solzhenitsyn was awarded the      nobel prize in literature  for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature   solzhenitsyn was afraid to go to stockholm to receive his award for fear that he would not be allowed to reenter  he was eventually expelled from the soviet union in       but returned to russia in      after the state s dissolution 

solzhenitsyn was born in kislovodsk  rsfsr  now in stavropol krai  russia   his mother  taisiya zakharovna  n  e shcherbak   was of ukrainian descent  her father had risen from humble beginnings to become a wealthy landowner  acquiring a large estate in the kuban region in the northern foothills of the caucasus  during world war i  taisiya went to moscow to study  while there she met and married isaakiy semyonovich solzhenitsyn  a young officer in the imperial russian army of cossack origin and fellow native of the caucasus region  the family background of his parents is vividly brought to life in the opening chapters of  august        and in the later  red wheel  novels 

in       taisiya became pregnant with aleksandr  on    june  shortly after her pregnancy was confirmed  isaakiy was killed in a hunting accident  aleksandr was raised by his widowed mother and his aunt in lowly circumstances  his earliest years coincided with the russian civil war  by      the family property had been turned into a collective farm  later  solzhenitsyn recalled that his mother had fought for survival and that they had to keep his father s background in the old imperial army a secret  his educated mother  who never remarried  encouraged his literary and scientific learnings and raised him in the russian orthodox faith  she died in      

as early as       solzhenitsyn began developing the characters and concepts for a planned epic work on world war i and the russian revolution  this eventually led to the novel  august        some of the chapters he wrote then still survive  solzhenitsyn studied mathematics at rostov state university  at the same time he took correspondence courses from the moscow institute of philosophy  literature and history  at this time heavily ideological in scope  as he himself makes clear  he did not question the state ideology or the superiority of the soviet union until he spent time in the camps 

during the war  solzhenitsyn served as the commander of a sound ranging battery in the red army  was involved in major action at the front  and was twice decorated  he was awarded the order of the red star on   july      for sound ranging two german artillery batteries and adjusting counterbattery fire onto them  resulting in their destruction 

a series of writings published late in his life  including the early uncompleted novel  love the revolution    chronicles his wartime experience and his growing doubts about the moral foundations of the soviet regime 

while serving as an artillery officer in east prussia  solzhenitsyn witnessed war crimes against local german civilians by soviet military personnel  the noncombatants and the elderly were robbed of their meager possessions and women and girls were gang raped to death  a few years later  in the forced labor camp  he memorized a poem titled  prussian nights  about these incidents  in this poem  which describes the gang rape of a polish woman whom the red army soldiers mistakenly thought to be a german  the first person narrator comments on the events with sarcasm and refers to the responsibility of official soviet writers like ilya ehrenburg 

in  the gulag archipelago   solzhenitsyn wrote   there is nothing that so assists the awakening of omniscience within us as insistent thoughts about one s own transgressions  errors  mistakes  after the difficult cycles of such ponderings over many years  whenever i mentioned the heartlessness of our highest ranking bureaucrats  the cruelty of our executioners  i remember myself in my captain s shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through east prussia  enshrouded in fire  and i say   so were  we  any better   

in february       while serving in east prussia  solzhenitsyn was arrested by smersh for writing derogatory comments in private letters to a friend  nikolai vitkevich  about the conduct of the war by joseph stalin  whom he called  khozyain    the boss    and  balabos   yiddish rendering of hebrew  baal ha bayit  for  master of the house    also he had talks with the same friend about the need of a new organisation against the soviet regime 

he was accused of anti soviet propaganda under article    paragraph    of the soviet criminal code  and of  founding a hostile organization  under paragraph    
solzhenitsyn was taken to the lubyanka prison in moscow  where he was interrogated  on   may       it was announced that germany had surrendered and all of moscow broke out in celebrations with fireworks and searchlights illuminating the sky to celebrate the victory in the great patriotic war as russians call the war with germany  from his cell in the lubyanka  solzhenitsyn remembered   above the muzzle of our window  and from all the other cells of the lubyanka  and from all the windows of the moscow prisons  we too  former prisoners of war and former front line soldiers  watched the moscow heavens  patterned with fireworks and crisscrossed with beams of searchlights  there was no rejoicing in our cells and no hugs and no kisses for us  that victory was not ours   on   july       he was sentenced in his absence by special council of the nkvd to an eight year term in a labour camp  this was the normal sentence for most crimes under article    at the time 

the first part of solzhenitsyn s sentence was served in several different work camps  the  middle phase   as he later referred to it  was spent in a  sharashka   i e   a special scientific research facility run by ministry of state security   where he met lev kopelev  upon whom he based the character of  lev rubin  in his book  the first circle   published in a self censored or  distorted  version in the west in       an english translation of the full version was eventually published by harper perennial in october       
in       he was sent to a  special camp  for political prisoners  during his imprisonment at the camp in the town of ekibastuz in kazakhstan  he worked as a miner  bricklayer  and foundry foreman  his experiences at ekibastuz formed the basis for the book  one day in the life of ivan denisovich   one of his fellow political prisoners  ion moraru  remembers that solzhenitsyn spent some of his time at ekibastuz writing 
while there solzhenitsyn had a tumor removed  his cancer was not diagnosed at the time 

in march       after his sentence ended  solzhenitsyn was sent to internal exile for life at birlik  a village in baidibek district of south kazakhstan region of kazakhstan  kok terek rural district   his undiagnosed cancer spread until  by the end of the year  he was close to death  in       he was permitted to be treated in a hospital in tashkent  where his tumor went into remission  his experiences there became the basis of his novel  cancer ward  and also found an echo in the short story  the right hand   it was during this decade of imprisonment and exile that solzhenitsyn abandoned marxism and developed the philosophical and religious positions of his later life  gradually becoming a philosophically minded eastern orthodox christian as a result of his experience in prison and the camps 
he repented for some of his actions as a red army captain  and in prison compared himself to the perpetrators of the gulag   i remember myself in my captain s shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through east prussia  enshrouded in fire  and i say   so were we any better    his transformation is described at some length in the fourth part of  the gulag archipelago    the soul and barbed wire    the narrative poem  the trail   written without benefit of pen or paper in prison and camps between      and       and the    poems composed in prison  forced labour camp  and exile also provide crucial material for understanding solzhenitsyn s intellectual and spiritual odyssey during this period  these  early  works  largely unknown in the west  were published for the first time in russian in      and excerpted in english in      

on   april       while at the university  solzhenitsyn married natalia alekseevna reshetovskaya  they had just over a year of married life before he went into the army  then to the gulag  they divorced in       a year before his release  because wives of gulag prisoners faced loss of work or residence permits  after the end of his internal exile  they remarried in       divorcing a second time in      

the following year solzhenitsyn married his second wife  natalia dmitrievna svetlova  a mathematician who had a son from a brief prior marriage  he and svetlova  born       had three sons  yermolai         ignat         and stepan        

solzhenitsyn s adopted son dmitri turin died on march           aged     at his home in new york city due to a heart attack 

after khrushchev s secret speech in       solzhenitsyn was freed from exile and exonerated  following his return from exile  solzhenitsyn was  while teaching at a secondary school during the day  spending his nights secretly engaged in writing  in his nobel prize acceptance speech he wrote that  during all the years until       not only was i convinced i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime  but  also  i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared this would become known  

in       aged     he approached aleksandr tvardovsky  a poet and the chief editor of the  novy mir  magazine  with the manuscript of  one day in the life of ivan denisovich   it was published in edited form in       with the explicit approval of nikita khrushchev  who defended it at the presidium of the politburo hearing on whether to allow its publication  and added   there s a stalinist in each of you  there s even a stalinist in me  we must root out this evil   the book quickly sold out and became an instant hit  in the     s  while he was publicly known to be writing  cancer ward   he was simultaneously writing  the gulag archipelago   during khrushchev s tenure   one day in the life of ivan denisovich  was studied in schools in the soviet union  as were three more short works of solzhenitsyn s  including his short story  matryona s home   published in       these would be the last of his works published in the soviet union until      

 one day in the life of ivan denisovich  brought the soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the west  it caused as much of a sensation in the soviet union as it did in the west   not only by its striking realism and candor  but also because it was the first major piece of soviet literature since the     s on a politically charged theme  written by a non party member  indeed a man who had been to siberia for  libelous speech  about the leaders  and yet its publication had been officially permitted  in this sense  the publication of solzhenitsyn s story was an almost unheard of instance of free  unrestrained discussion of politics through literature  most soviet readers realized this  but after khrushchev had been ousted from power in       the time for such raw exposing works came to an end 

solzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt  with the help of tvardovsky  to get his novel  cancer ward  legally published in the soviet union  this had to get the approval of the union of writers  though some there appreciated it  the work ultimately was denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti soviet insinuations 

after krushchev s removal in       the cultural climate again became more repressive  publishing of solzhenitsyn s work quickly stopped  as a writer  he became a non person  and  by       the kgb had seized some of his papers  including the manuscript of  the first circle   meanwhile  solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most well known of all his writings   the gulag archipelago   the seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened  but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an  officially acclaimed  writer  something which had come close to second nature  but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant 

after the kgb had confiscated solzhenitsyn s materials in moscow  during            the preparatory drafts of  the gulag archipelago  were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends  homes in estonia  aleksandr solzhenitsyn had befriended arnold susi  a lawyer and former estonian minister of education in a lubyanka prison cell  after completion  solzhenitsyn s original handwritten script was kept hidden from the kgb in estonia by arnold susi s daughter heli susi until the collapse of the soviet union 

in       solzhenitsyn was expelled from the union of writers  in       he was awarded the nobel prize in literature  he could not receive the prize personally in stockholm at that time  since he was afraid he would not be let back into the soviet union  instead  it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the swedish embassy in moscow  the swedish government refused to accept this solution because such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the soviet union and damage swedish soviet relations  instead  solzhenitsyn received his prize at the      ceremony after he had been expelled from the soviet union 

 the gulag archipelago  was composed from      to       it was a three volume  seven part work on the soviet prison camp system  solzhenitsyn never had all seven parts of the work in front of him at one time   the book was based upon solzhenitsyn s own experience as well as the testimony of     former prisoners and solzhenitsyn s own research into the history of the russian penal system  it discussed the system s origins from the founding of the communist regime  with vladimir lenin having responsibility  detailing interrogation procedures  prisoner transports  prison camp culture  prisoner uprisings and revolts  and the practice of internal exile   the gulag archipelago  has sold over thirty million copies in thirty five languages 

according to fellow gulag historian anne applebaum   the gulag archipelago  s rich and varied authorial voice  its unique weaving together of personal testimony  philosophical analysis  and historical investigation  and its unrelenting indictment of communist ideology made  the gulag archipelago  one of the most influential books of the   th century 

even though  the gulag archipelago  was not published in the soviet union  it was extensively criticized by the party controlled soviet press  an editorial in  pravda  on    january      accused solzhenitsyn of supporting  hitlerites  and making  excuses for the crimes of the vlasovites and bandera gangs   according to the editorial  solzhenitsyn was  choking with pathological hatred for the country where he was born and grew up  for the socialist system  and for soviet people  

during this period  he was sheltered by the cellist mstislav rostropovich  who suffered considerably for his support of solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself 

in august       the kgb allegedly made an attempt to assassinate solzhenitsyn using an unknown biological agent  most likely ricin  with an experimental gel based delivery method  the attempt left him seriously ill but was unsuccessful 

in a discussion of its options in dealing with solzhenitsyn the members of the politburo considered his arrest and imprisonment and his expulsion to a socialist country  guided by kgb chief yury andropov  and with encouraging statements from willy brandt  it was decided to deport the writer directly to west germany 

on    february       solzhenitsyn was arrested and deported the next day from the soviet union to frankfurt  west germany and stripped of his soviet citizenship  the kgb had found the manuscript for the first part of  the gulag archipelago  and  less than a week later  yevgeny yevtushenko suffered reprisals for his support of solzhenitsyn  u s  military attach   william odom managed to smuggle out a large portion of solzhenitsyn s archive  including the author s membership card for the writers  union and second world war military citations  solzhenitsyn subsequently paid tribute to odom s role in his memoir  invisible allies         

in west germany  solzhenitsyn lived in heinrich b  ll s house in langenbroich  he then moved to z  rich  switzerland before stanford university invited him to stay in the united states to  facilitate your work  and to accommodate you and your family   he stayed on the   th floor of the hoover tower  part of the hoover institution  before moving to cavendish  vermont  in       he was given an honorary literary degree from harvard university in      and on thursday    june       he gave his commencement address  condemning  among other things  the press  the lack of spirituality and traditional values as well as anthropocentrism in western culture 

over the next    years  solzhenitsyn worked on his dramatized history of the russian revolution of        the red wheel   by       four  knots   parts  had been completed and he had also written several shorter works 

despite spending almost two decades in the united states  solzhenitsyn did not become fluent in spoken english  he had  however  been reading english language literature since his teens  encouraged by his mother  more importantly  he resented the idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking in order to suit television  solzhenitsyn s warnings about the dangers of communist aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the west were generally well received in western conservative circles  e g  ford administration staffers richard cheney and donald rumsfeld advocated on solzhenitsyn s behalf for him to speak directly to president gerald ford about the soviet threat   prior to and alongside the tougher foreign policy pursued by us president ronald reagan  at the same time  liberals and secularists became increasingly critical of what they perceived as his reactionary preference for russian nationalism and the russian orthodox religion 

solzhenitsyn also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant pop culture of the modern west  including television and much of popular music      the human soul longs for things higher  warmer  and purer than those offered by today s mass living habits    by tv stupor and by intolerable music   despite his criticism of the  weakness  of the west  solzhenitsyn always made clear that he admired the political liberty which was one of the enduring strengths of western democratic societies  in a major speech delivered to the international academy of philosophy in liechtenstein on    september       solzhenitsyn implored the west not to  lose sight of its own values  its historically unique stability of civic life under the rule of law   a hard won stability which grants independence and space to every private citizen  

in a series of writings  speeches  and interviews after his return to his native russia in       solzhenitsyn spoke about his admiration for the local self government he had witnessed first hand in switzerland and new england  he  praised  the sensible and sure process of grassroots democracy  in which the local population solves most of its problems on its own  not waiting for the decisions of higher authorities    solzhenitsyn s patriotism was inward looking  he called for russia to  renounce all mad fantasies of foreign conquest and begin the peaceful long  long long period of recuperation   as he put it in a      bbc interview with janis sapiets 

on   august       solzhenitsyn was poisoned with what was later determined to be ricin  but survived 

on    september       yuri andropov approved a large scale operation to discredit solzhenitsyn and his family and cut his communications with soviet dissidents  the plan was jointly approved by vladimir kryuchkov  philipp bobkov  and grigorenko  heads of first  second and fifth kgb directorates   the residencies in geneva  london  paris  rome and other european cities participated in the operation  among other active measures  at least three stb agents became translators and secretaries of solzhenitsyn  one of them translated the poem  prussian nights    keeping kgb informed regarding all contacts by solzhenitsyn 

the kgb sponsored a series of hostile books about solzhenitsyn  most notably a  memoir published under the name of his first wife  natalia reshetovskaya  but probably mostly composed by service   according to historian christopher andrew  andropov also gave an order to create  an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion between pauk and the people around him  by feeding him rumors that everyone in his surrounding was a kgb agent and deceiving him in all possible ways  among other things  the writer constantly received envelopes with photographs of car accidents  brain surgery and other frightening illustrations  after the kgb harassment in z  rich  solzhenitsyn settled in cavendish  vermont  reduced communications with others and surrounded his property with a barbed wire fence  his influence and moral authority for the west diminished as he became increasingly isolated and critical of western individualism  kgb and cpsu experts finally concluded that he alienated american listeners by his  reactionary views and intransigent criticism of the us way of life   so no further active measures would be required 

in       his soviet citizenship was restored  and  in       he returned to russia with his wife  natalia  who had become a united states citizen  their sons stayed behind in the united states  later  his oldest son yermolai returned to russia   from then until his death  he lived with his wife in a dacha in troitse lykovo in west moscow between the dachas once occupied by soviet leaders mikhail suslov and konstantin chernenko  a staunch believer in traditional russian culture  solzhenitsyn expressed his disillusionment with post soviet russia in works such as  rebuilding russia   and called for the establishment of a strong presidential republic balanced by vigorous institutions of local self government  the latter would remain his major political theme  solzhenitsyn also published eight two part short stories  a series of contemplative  miniatures  or prose poems  a literary memoir on his years in the west   the grain between the millstones    among many other writings  once back in russia solzhenitsyn hosted a television talk show program  its eventual format was solzhenitsyn delivering a    minute monologue twice a month  it was discontinued in       solzhenitsyn became a supporter of vladimir putin who said he shared solzhenitsyn s critical view towards the russian revolution 

all of solzhenitsyn s sons became us citizens  one  ignat  is a pianist and conductor  elder son yermolai works for the moscow office of mckinsey   company  a leading management consultancy firm  where he is now a senior partner 

solzhenitsyn died of heart failure near moscow on   august       at the age of     a burial service was held at donskoy monastery  moscow  on wednesday    august       he was buried the same day in the monastery in a spot he had chosen  russian and world leaders paid tribute to solzhenitsyn following his death 

the aleksandr solzhenitsyn center supports explorations into the life and writings of the author and hosts the official english language site dedicated to aleksandr solzhenitsyn  the center strives to advance the legacy of aleksandr solzhenitsyn in the english speaking world through the promotion of a better understanding of his life  thought  and works 

regarding atheism  solzhenitsyn declared 
in his      essay  repentance and self limitation in the life of nations   solzhenitsyn called for russian gentiles and jews alike to take moral responsibility for the  renegades  from both communities who enthusiastically created a marxist   leninist police state after the october revolution  in a november           review of solzhenitsyn s novel  august       in  the new york times   jewish american historian richard pipes commented   every culture has its own brand of anti semitism  in solzhenitsyn s case  it s not racial  it has nothing to do with blood  he s certainly not a racist  the question is fundamentally religious and cultural  he bears some resemblance to fyodor dostoyevsky  who was a fervent christian and patriot  solzhenitsyn is unquestionably in the grip of the russian extreme right s view of the revolution  which is that it was the doing of the jews  

in his      book  russia in collapse   solzhenitsyn excoriated the russian extreme right s obsession with anti semitic and anti masonic conspiracy theories  

jewish holocaust survivor elie wiesel wrote that solzhenitsyn was  too intelligent  too honest  too courageous  too great a writer  to be an anti semite 

in      solzhenitsyn published a two volume work on the history of russian jewish relations   two hundred years together               a bestseller in russia  the book triggered renewed accusations of anti semitism  similarities between  two hundred years together  and an anti semitic essay titled   jews in the ussr and in the future russia    attributed to solzhenitsyn  has led to inference that he stands behind the anti semitic passages  solzhenitsyn himself claims that the essay consists of manuscripts stolen from him  and then manipulated  forty years ago  according to the historian semyon reznik  textological analyses have proven solzhenitsyn s authorship 

in some of his later political writings  such as  rebuilding russia         and  russia in collapse          solzhenitsyn criticized the oligarchic excesses of the new russian democracy  while opposing any nostalgia for soviet communism  he defended moderate and self critical patriotism  as opposed to extreme nationalism   urged local self government to a free russia  and expressed concerns for the fate of the    million ethnic russians in the  near abroad  of the former soviet union 

in a      interview with  der spiegel   solzhenitsyn expressed disappointment that the  conflation of  soviet  and  russian   against which i spoke so often in the     s  has not passed away in the west  in the ex socialist countries  or in the former soviet republics  the elder political generation in communist countries is not ready for repentance  while the new generation is only too happy to voice grievances and level accusations  with present day moscow  as  a convenient target  they behave as if they heroically liberated themselves and lead a new life now  while moscow has remained communist  nevertheless  i dare  to  hope that this unhealthy phase will soon be over  that all the peoples who have lived through communism will understand that communism is to blame for the bitter pages of their history  

once in the united states  solzhenitsyn sharply criticized the west  in his commencement address at harvard university in       solzhenitsyn said   but members of the u s  antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations  in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on    million people there  do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there  

solzhenitsyn criticized the allies for not opening a new front against nazi germany in the west earlier in world war ii  this resulted in soviet domination and oppression of the nations of eastern europe  solzhenitsyn claimed the western democracies apparently cared little about how many died in the east  as long as they could end the war quickly and painlessly for themselves in the west 
delivering the commencement address at harvard university in       he called the united states spiritually weak and mired in vulgar materialism  americans  he said  speaking in russian through a translator  suffered from a  decline in courage  and a  lack of manliness   few were willing to die for their ideals  he said  he condemned both the united states government and american society for its  hasty  capitulation in the vietnam war  he criticized the country s music as intolerable and attacked its unfettered press  accusing it of violations of privacy  he said that the west erred in measuring other civilizations by its own model  while faulting soviet society for denying fair legal treatment of people  he also faulted the west for being too legalistic   a society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities   solzhenitsyn also argued that the west erred in  denying  russian culture s  autonomous character and therefore never understood it  

in       solzhenitsyn accused nato of trying to bring russia under its control  he claimed this was visual because of its  ideological support for the  colour revolutions  and the paradoxical forcing of north atlantic interests on central asia   in a      interview with  der spiegel  he stated  this was especially painful in the case of ukraine  a country whose closeness to russia is defined by literally millions of family ties among our peoples  relatives living on different sides of the national border  at one fell stroke  these families could be torn apart by a new dividing line  the border of a military bloc  

solzhenitsyn emphasized the significantly more oppressive character of the soviet totalitarian regime  in comparison to the russian empire of the house of romanov  he asserted that imperial russia did not practice any real censorship in the style of the soviet glavlit  that political prisoners typically were not forced into labor camps  and that the number of political prisoners and exiles was only one ten thousandth of those in the soviet union  he noted that the tsar s secret police  or okhrana  was only present in the three largest cities  and not at all in the imperial russian army 

shortly before his return to russia  solzhenitsyn delivered a speech in lucs sur boulogne to commemorate the    th anniversary of the vend  e uprising  during his speech  solzhenitsyn compared lenin s bolsheviks with the jacobin party during the french revolution  he also compared the vendean rebels with the russian  ukrainian  and cossack peasants who rebelled against the bolsheviks  saying that both were destroyed mercilessly by revolutionary despotism  however  he commented that  while the french reign of terror ended with the toppling of the jacobins and the execution of maximilien robespierre  its soviet equivalent continued to accelerate until the khrushchev thaw of the     s 

according to solzhenitsyn  russians were not the ruling nation in the soviet union  he believed that all the traditional culture of all ethnic groups were equally oppressed in favor of an atheism and marxist   leninism  russian culture was even more repressed than any other culture in the soviet union  since the regime was more afraid of ethnic uprisings among russian christians than among any other ethnicity  therefore  solzhenitsyn argued  russian nationalism and the orthodox church should not be regarded as a threat by the west but rather as allies 

in  rebuilding russia   an essay first published in      in  komsomolskaya pravda  solzhenitsyn urged russia to grant independence to all the non slav republics  which he claimed were sapping the russian nation and he called for the creation of a new slavic state bringing together russia  ukraine  belarus  and parts of kazakhstan that he considered to be russified 

according to daniel j  mahoney      if one opens almost any page of solzhenitsyn s      essay  the russian question  at the end of the twentieth century  one finds solzhenitsyn attacking the cruelties and injustice of serfdom  faulting tsarist authorities for their blindness about the need for political liberty in russia  and for their wasting of the nation s strength in unnecessary and counterproductive foreign adventures  moreover  he attacks pan slavism  the idea that russia had a mission to unite slavic peoples and to come to the defense of the orthodox wherever they were under threat  as a  wretched idea   

solzhenitsyn gave a speech to afl   cio in washington  d c   on    june       where he mentioned how the system created by bolsheviks in      caused dozens of problems in the soviet union  he described how this system  in time of peace  artificially created a famine  causing   million people to die in the ukraine in      and        following this  he stated that  they died on the very edge of europe  and europe didn t even notice it  the world didn t even notice it     million people   solzhenitsyn opined on   april      in  izvestia  that the     s famine in the ukraine was no different from the russian famine of      as both were caused by the ruthless robbery of peasants by bolshevik grain procurements  he claimed that the  provocatory shriek about a  genocide  was started in the minds of ukrainian chauvinists decades later  who are also viciously opposed to  moskals    the writer cautioned that the genocidal claim has its chances to be accepted by the west due to the general western ignorance of russian and ukrainian history 

solzhenitsyn s philosophy plays a key role in the      film  cloud atlas   where a character previously kept ignorant and subservient is illegally educated  and is shown reading and quoting his works 

in october       french literary journalist bernard pivot made an hour long tv interview with solzhenitsyn at his rural home in vermont  u s  solzhenitsyn discussed his writing  the evolution of his language and style  his family and his outlook on the future   and stated his wish to return to russia in his lifetime  not just to see his books eventually printed there  earlier the same year  solzhenitsyn was interviewed on separate occasions by two british journalists  bernard levin and malcolm muggeridge 

in       russian filmmaker alexander sokurov shot tv documentary  besedy s solzhenitsynym    the dialogues with solzhenitsyn   of four parts  the documentary shot in solzhenitsyn s home shows his everyday life and covers his reflections on russian history and literature 

on    december       the russian channel  rossiya k  showed the french television documentary  l histoire secr  te de l archipel du goulag   the secret history of the gulag archipelago  made by jean cr  pu and nicolas miletitch and translated into russian under the title  taynaya istoriya  arkhipelaga gulag                                                                   the documentary covers events related to creation and publication of  the gulag archipelago

the aberdeen area has seen human settlement for at least       years  the city began as two separate burghs  old aberdeen at the mouth of the river don  and new aberdeen  a fishing and trading settlement  where the denburn waterway entered the river dee estuary  the earliest charter was granted by william the lion in      and confirmed the corporate rights granted by david i  in       the great charter of robert the bruce transformed aberdeen into a property owning and financially independent community  granted with it was the nearby forest of stocket  whose income formed the basis for the city s common good fund which still benefits aberdonians

the expensive infrastructure works led to the city becoming bankrupt in      during the post napoleonic depression  an economic downturn immediately after the napoleonic wars  but the city s prosperity later recovered  the increasing economic importance of aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the construction of the present harbour including victoria dock and the south breakwater  and the extension of the north pier  gas street lighting arrived in      and an enhanced water supply appeared in      when water was pumped from the dee to a reservoir in union place  an underground sewer system replaced open sewers in       the city was incorporated in       although old aberdeen has a separate history and still holds its ancient charter  it is no longer officially independent  it is an integral part of the city  as is woodside and the royal burgh of torry to the south of the river dee 

aberdeen was in pictish territory and became gaelic speaking at some time in the medieval period  old aberdeen is the approximate location of  aberdon   the first settlement of aberdeen  this literally means  the mouth of the don   the celtic word   means  river mouth   as in modern welsh  aberystwyth  aberdare  aberbeeg etc   the scottish gaelic name is    variation        presumably being a loan from the earlier pictish  the gaelic term is    and in latin  the romans referred to the river as  devana   mediaeval  or ecclesiastical  latin has it as

being sited between two river mouths  the city has little natural exposure of bedrock  this leaves local geologists in a slight quandary  despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area  courtesy of the oil industry   there is only a vague understanding of what underlies the city  to the south side of the city  coastal cliffs expose high grade metamorphic rocks of the grampian group  to the south west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high grade schists  to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead  the small amount of geophysics done  and occasional building related exposures  combined with small exposures in the banks of the river don  suggest that it is actually sited on an inlier of devonian  old red  sandstones and silts  the outskirts of the city spread beyond the  inferred  limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic  igneous complexes formed during the dalradian period  approximately            million years ago  with sporadic areas of igneous diorite granites to be found  such as that at the rubislaw quarry which was used to build much of the victorian parts of the city

traditionally  aberdeen was home to fishing  textile mills  shipbuilding and paper making  these industries have been largely replaced  high technology developments in the electronics design and development industry  research in agriculture and fishing and the oil industry  which has been largely responsible for aberdeen s economic boom in the last three decades  are now major parts of aberdeen s economy 
until the     s  most of aberdeen s leading industries dated from the   th century  mainly these were textiles  foundry work  shipbuilding and paper making  the oldest industry in the city  with paper having been first made there in       paper making has reduced in importance since the closures of donside paper mill in      and the davidson mill in      leaving the stoneywood paper mill with a workforce of approximately      textile production ended in      when richards of aberdeen closed

aberdeen had been a major maritime centre throughout the   th century  when a group of local entrepreneurs launched the first steam powered trawler  the steam trawling industry expanded and by      aberdeen was scotland s top fishing port  employing nearly       men with     vessels sailing from its harbour  by the time oil was coming on stream  much of the trawling fleet had relocated to peterhead  although aberdeen still brings in substantial catches  the tugs  safety vessels and supply ships which pack the harbour far outnumber the trawlers 

geologists had speculated about the existence of oil and gas in the north sea since the middle of the   th century  but tapping its deep and inhospitable waters was another story  with the middle eastern oil sheiks becoming more aware of the political and economic power of their oil reserves and government threats of rationing  the industry began to consider the north sea as a viable source of oil  exploration commenced in the     s and the first major find in the british sector was in november      in the forties field  east of aberdeen 

by late       after years of intense construction the necessary infrastructure was in place  in aberdeen  at bp s  british petroleum  headquarters  the queen pressed the button that would set the whole thing moving  oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far away grangemouth  while many ports have suffered decline  aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry  a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area 

the industry supports about        jobs locally  and known reserves ensure that oil will continue to flow well into the   st century

antipope

an antipope    is a person who  in opposition to the one who is generally seen as the legitimately elected pope  makes a significantly accepted competing claim to be the pope  the bishop of rome and leader of the roman catholic church  at times between the  rd and mid   th centuries  antipopes were supported by a fairly significant faction of religious cardinals and secular or anti religious monarchs and kingdoms  persons who claim to be pope  but have few followers  such as the modern sedevacantist antipopes  are not classified with the historical antipopes 

hippolytus of rome  d        is commonly considered to be the earliest antipope  as he headed a separate group within the church in rome against pope callixtus i  hippolytus was reconciled to callixtus s second successor  pope pontian  and both he and pontian are honoured as saints by the catholic church with a shared feast day on    august  whether two or more persons have been confused in this account of hippolytus and whether hippolytus actually declared himself to be the bishop of rome  remains unclear  since no such claim by hippolytus has been cited in the writings attributed to him 

eusebius quotes from an unnamed earlier writer the story of natalius  a  rd century priest who accepted the bishopric of the adoptionists  a heretical group in rome  natalius soon repented and tearfully begged pope zephyrinus to receive him into communion 

novatian  d        another third century figure  certainly claimed the see of rome in opposition to pope cornelius  and if natalius and hippolytus were excluded because of the uncertainties concerning them  novatian could then be said to be the first antipope 

the period in which antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the popes and the holy roman emperors of the   th and   th centuries  the emperors frequently imposed their own nominees to further their own causes  the popes  likewise  sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants  anti kings  in germany to overcome a particular emperor 

the western schism   which began in       when the french cardinals  claiming that the election of pope urban vi was invalid  elected antipope clement vii as a rival to the roman pope   led eventually to two competing lines of antipopes  the avignon line  clement vii took up residence in avignon  france   and the pisan line  the pisan line  which began in       was named after the town of pisa  italy  where the  pisan  council had elected antipope alexander v as a third claimant  to end the schism  in may       the council of constance deposed antipope john xxiii of the pisan line  pope gregory xii of the roman line resigned in july       in       the council also formally deposed antipope benedict xiii of avignon  but he refused to resign  afterwards  pope martin v was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to benedict xiii  the scandal of the western schism created anti papal sentiment and fed into the protestant reformation at the turn of the   th century 

the following table gives the names of the antipopes included in the list of popes and antipopes in the  annuario pontificio   with the addition of the names of natalius  in spite of doubts about his historicity  and antipope clement viii  whose following was insignificant  
an asterisk marks those who were included in the conventional numbering of later popes who took the same name  more commonly  the antipope is ignored in later papal regnal numbers  for example  there was an antipope john xxiii  but the new pope john elected in      was also called john xxiii  for the additional confusion regarding popes named john  see pope john  numbering  

the list of popes and antipopes in the  annuario pontificio  attaches the following note to the name of pope leo viii             

at this point  as again in the mid   th century  we come across elections in which problems of harmonising historical criteria and those of theology and canon law make it impossible to decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the successors of saint peter  the uncertainty that in some cases results has made it advisable to abandon the assignation of successive numbers in the list of the popes 
thus  because of the obscurities about mid   th century canon law and the historical facts  the  annuario pontificio  lists sylvester iii as a pope  without thereby expressing a judgement on his legitimacy  the  catholic encyclopedia  places him in its  list of popes   but with the annotation   considered by some to be an antipope   other sources classify him as an antipope 

those with asterisks     were counted in subsequent papal numbering 

many antipopes created cardinals  known as  quasi cardinals   and a few created cardinal nephews  known as  quasi cardinal nephews  
in modern times various people claim to be pope and  though they do not fit the technical definition of  antipope   are sometimes referred to as such  they are usually leaders of sedevacantist groups who view the see of rome as vacant and elect someone to fill it  they are sometimes referred to as conclavists because of their claim  on the basis of an election by a  conclave  of perhaps half a dozen laypeople  as in the case of david bawden   pope michael i    to have rendered the see no longer vacant  a significant number of these have taken the name  peter ii   owing to its special significance  from the point of view of the catholic church  they are schismatics  and as such are automatically excommunicated 



the palmarian catholic church regards pope paul vi  whom they revere as a martyr  and his predecessors as true popes  but hold  on the grounds of claimed apparitions  that the pope of rome is excommunicated and that the position of the holy see has  since       been transferred to the see of el palmar de troya 

the following were elected by allegedly faithful catholics  none of whom was a cardinal 

as the patriarch of alexandria  egypt  has historically also held the title of pope  a person who  in opposition to someone who is generally accepted as a legitimate pope of alexandria  claims to hold that position may also be considered an antipope  in       the defrocked married coptic lector max michel became an antipope of alexandria  calling himself maximos i  his claim to the alexandrine papacy was dismissed by both the coptic orthodox pope shenouda iii and pope theodore ii of the greek orthodox church of alexandria  the coptic pope of alexandria and the greek pope of alexandria currently view one another  not as antipopes  but rather as successors to differing lines of apostolic succession that formed as a result of christological disputes in the fifth century 

another coptic  alexandrian  antipope is known to have laid claim in the fourth century  his name was gregory of cappadocia 

antipopes have appeared as fictional characters  these may be either in historical fiction  as fictional portraits of well known historical antipopes or as purely imaginary antipopes 






aquaculture

aquaculture  less commonly spelled aquiculture   also known as aquafarming  is the farming of fish  crustaceans  molluscs  aquatic plants  algae  and other organisms  aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled conditions  and can be contrasted with commercial fishing  which is the harvesting of wild fish  mariculture refers to aquaculture practiced in marine environments and in underwater habitats 

according to the food and agriculture organization  fao   aquaculture  is understood to mean the farming of aquatic organisms including fish  molluscs  crustaceans and aquatic plants  farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production  such as regular stocking  feeding  protection from predators  etc  farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated   the reported output from global aquaculture operations in      supplied over one half of the fish and shellfish that is directly consumed by humans  however  there are issues about the reliability of the reported figures  further  in current aquaculture practice  products from several pounds of wild fish are used to produce one pound of a piscivorous fish like salmon 

particular kinds of aquaculture include fish farming  shrimp farming  oyster farming  mariculture  algaculture  such as seaweed farming   and the cultivation of ornamental fish  particular methods include aquaponics and integrated multi trophic aquaculture  both of which integrate fish farming and aquatic plant farming 
the indigenous gunditjmara people in victoria  australia  may have raised eels as early as       bc  evidence indicates they developed about of volcanic floodplains in the vicinity of lake condah into a complex of channels and dams  and used woven traps to capture eels  and preserve them to eat all year round 

aquaculture was operating in china  circa        bc  when the waters subsided after river floods  some fish  mainly carp  were trapped in lakes  early aquaculturists fed their brood using nymphs and silkworm feces  and ate them  a fortunate genetic mutation of carp led to the emergence of goldfish during the tang dynasty  however  ancient egyptians might have farmed fish  especially gilt head bream  from lake bardawil about       years ago  and they even traded them with canaan 

 gim  cultivation is the oldest aquaculture in korea  early cultivation methods used bamboo or oak sticks  which were replaced by newer methods that utilized nets in the   th century  floating rafts have been used for mass production since the     s 

japanese cultivated seaweed by providing bamboo poles and  later  nets and oyster shells to serve as anchoring surfaces for spores 

romans bred fish in ponds and farmed oysters in coastal lagoons before     ce 

in central europe  early christian monasteries adopted roman aquacultural practices  aquaculture spread in europe during the middle ages since away from the seacoasts and the big rivers  fish had to be salted so they did not rot  improvements in transportation during the   th century made fresh fish easily available and inexpensive  even in inland areas  making aquaculture less popular  the   th century fishponds of the trebon basin in the czech republic are maintained as a unesco world heritage site 

hawaiians constructed oceanic fish ponds  a remarkable example is the  menehune  fishpond dating from at least        years ago  at alekoko  legend says that it was constructed by the mythical menehune dwarf people 

in the first half of the   th century  german experimented with external fertilization of brown trouts and salmon  he wrote an article   von der k  nstlichen erzeugung der forellen und lachse    by the latter decades of the   th century  oyster farming had begun in estuaries along the atlantic coast of north america 

the word aquaculture appeared in an      newspaper article in reference to the harvesting of ice  it also appeared in descriptions of the terrestrial agricultural practise of subirrigation in the late   th century before becoming associated primarily with the cultivation of aquatic plant and animal species 

in       stephen ainsworth of west bloomfield  new york  began experiments with brook trout  by       seth green had established a commercial fish hatching operation at caledonia springs  near rochester  new york  by       with the involvement of dr  w  w  fletcher of concord  massachusetts  artificial fish hatcheries were under way in both canada and the united states  when the dildo island fish hatchery opened in newfoundland in       it was the largest and most advanced in the world  the word aquaculture was used in descriptions of the hatcheries experiments with cod and lobster in      

by the     s  the american fish culture company of carolina  rhode island  founded in the     s was one of the leading producers of trout  during the     s  they had perfected the method of manipulating the day and night cycle of fish so that they could be artificially spawned year around 

californians harvested wild kelp and attempted to manage supply around       later labeling it a wartime resource 

harvest stagnation in wild fisheries and overexploitation of popular marine species  combined with a growing demand for high quality protein  encouraged aquaculturists to domesticate other marine species  at the outset of modern aquaculture  many were optimistic that a  blue revolution  could take place in aquaculture  just as the green revolution of the   th century had revolutionized agriculture  although land animals had long been domesticated  most seafood species were still caught from the wild  concerned about the impact of growing demand for seafood on the world s oceans  prominent ocean explorer jacques cousteau wrote in        with earth s burgeoning human populations to feed  we must turn to the sea with new understanding and new technology  

about           of the species cultured were domesticated during the   th and   st centuries  of which an estimated     came in the decade to       given the long term importance of agriculture  to date  only       of known land plant species and         of known land animal species have been domesticated  compared with       of known marine plant species and       of known marine animal species  domestication typically involves about a decade of scientific research  domesticating aquatic species involves fewer risks to humans than do land animals  which took a large toll in human lives  most major human diseases originated in domesticated animals  including diseases such as smallpox and diphtheria  that like most infectious diseases  move to humans from animals  no human pathogens of comparable virulence have yet emerged from marine species  

biological control methods to manage parasites are already being used  such as cleaner fish  e g  lumpsuckers and wrasse  to control sea lice populations in salmon farming  models are being used to help with spatial planning and siting of fish farms in order to minimize impact 

the decline in wild fish stocks has increased the demand for farmed fish  however  finding alternative sources of protein and oil for fish feed is necessary so the aquaculture industry can grow sustainably  otherwise  it represents a great risk for the over exploitation of forage fish 

another recent issue following the banning in      of organotins by the international maritime organization is the need to find environmentally friendly  but still effective  compounds with antifouling effects 

many new natural compounds are discovered every year  but producing them on a large enough scale for commercial purposes is almost impossible 

it is highly probable that future developments in this field will rely on microorganisms  but greater funding and further research is needed to overcome the lack of knowledge in this field 

microalgae  also referred to as phytoplankton  microphytes  or planktonic algae  constitute the majority of cultivated algae  macroalgae commonly known as seaweed also have many commercial and industrial uses  but due to their size and specific requirements  they are not easily cultivated on a large scale and are most often taken in the wild 

the farming of fish is the most common form of aquaculture  it involves raising fish commercially in tanks  fish ponds  or ocean enclosures  usually for food  a facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species  natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish hatchery  worldwide  the most important fish species used in fish farming are  in order  carp  salmon  tilapia  and catfish 

in the mediterranean  young bluefin tuna are netted at sea and towed slowly towards the shore  they are then interned in offshore pens where they are further grown for the market  in       researchers in australia managed for the first time to coax southern bluefin tuna to breed in landlocked tanks  southern bluefin tuna are also caught in the wild and fattened in grow out sea cages in southern spencer gulf  south australia 

a similar process is used in the salmon farming section of this industry  juveniles are taken from hatcheries and a variety of methods are used to aid them in their maturation  for example  as stated above  some of the most important fish species in the industry  salmon  can be grown using a cage system  this is done by having netted cages  preferably in open water that has a strong flow  and feeding the salmon a special food mixture that aids their growth  this process allows for year round growth of the fish  thus a higher harvest during the correct seasons  an additional method  known sometimes as sea ranching  has also been used within the industry  sea ranching involves raising fish in a hatchery for a brief time and then releasing them into marine waters for further development  whereupon the fish are recaptured when they have matured 

commercial shrimp farming began in the     s  and production grew steeply thereafter  global production reached more than     million tonnes in       worth about us   billion  about     of farmed shrimp is produced in asia  in particular in china and thailand  the other     is produced mainly in latin america  where brazil is the largest producer  thailand is the largest exporter 

shrimp farming has changed from its traditional  small scale form in southeast asia into a global industry  technological advances have led to ever higher densities per unit area  and broodstock is shipped worldwide  virtually all farmed shrimp are penaeids  i e   shrimp of the family penaeidae   and just two species of shrimp  the pacific white shrimp and the giant tiger prawn  account for about     of all farmed shrimp  these industrial monocultures are very susceptible to disease  which has decimated shrimp populations across entire regions  increasing ecological problems  repeated disease outbreaks  and pressure and criticism from both nongovernmental organizations and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late     s and generally stronger regulations  in       governments  industry representatives  and environmental organizations initiated a program aimed at developing and promoting more sustainable farming practices through the seafood watch program 

freshwater prawn farming shares many characteristics with  including many problems with  marine shrimp farming  unique problems are introduced by the developmental lifecycle of the main species  the giant river prawn 

the global annual production of freshwater prawns  excluding crayfish and crabs  in      was about         tonnes  exceeding      billion dollars  additionally  china produced about         tonnes of chinese river crab 

aquacultured shellfish include various oyster  mussel  and clam species  these bivalves are filter and or deposit feeders  which rely on ambient primary production rather than inputs of fish or other feed  as such  shellfish aquaculture is generally perceived as benign or even beneficial 

depending on the species and local conditions  bivalve molluscs are either grown on the beach  on longlines  or suspended from rafts and harvested by hand or by dredging  in may      a belgian consortium installed the first of two trial mussel farms on a wind farm in the north sea 

abalone farming began in the late     s and early     s in japan and china  since the mid     s  this industry has become increasingly successful  overfishing and poaching have reduced wild populations to the extent that farmed abalone now supplies most abalone meat  sustainably farmed molluscs can be certified by seafood watch and other organizations  including the world wildlife fund  wwf   wwf initiated the  aquaculture dialogues  in      to develop measurable and performance based standards for responsibly farmed seafood  in       wwf co founded the aquaculture stewardship council with the dutch sustainable trade initiative to manage the global standards and certification programs 

after trials in       a commercial  sea ranch  was set up in flinders bay  western australia  to raise abalone  the ranch is based on an artificial reef made up of         separate concrete units called  abitats   abalone habitats   the      kg abitats can host     abalone each  the reef is seeded with young abalone from an onshore hatchery  the abalone feed on seaweed that has grown naturally on the abitats  with the ecosystem enrichment of the bay also resulting in growing numbers of dhufish  pink snapper  wrasse  and samson fish  among other species 

brad adams  from the company  has emphasised the similarity to wild abalone and the difference from shore based aquaculture   we re not aquaculture  we re ranching  because once they re in the water they look after themselves  

other groups include aquatic reptiles  amphibians  and miscellaneous invertebrates  such as echinoderms and jellyfish  they are separately graphed at the top right of this section  since they do not contribute enough volume to show clearly on the main graph 

commercially harvested echinoderms include sea cucumbers and sea urchins  in china  sea cucumbers are farmed in artificial ponds as large as  

in       the total world production of fisheries was     million tonnes  of which aquaculture contributed      million tonnes  about      the growth rate of worldwide aquaculture has been sustained and rapid  averaging about    per year for over    years  while the take from wild fisheries  has been essentially flat for the last decade  the aquaculture market reached     billion in      

aquaculture is an especially important economic activity in china  between      and       the chinese bureau of fisheries reports  aquaculture harvests grew at an annual rate of        jumping from     million tonnes to nearly    million tonnes  in       china accounted for     of world production  aquaculture is also currently one of the fastest growing areas of food production in the u s 

about     of all u s  shrimp consumption is farmed and imported  in recent years  salmon aquaculture has become a major export in southern chile  especially in puerto montt  chile s fastest growing city 

a united nations report titled  the state of the world fisheries and aquaculture  released in may      maintained fisheries and aquaculture support the livelihoods of some    million people in asia and africa 

laws governing aquaculture practices vary greatly by country and are often not closely regulated or easily traceable  in the united states  land based and nearshore aquaculture is regulated at the federal and state levels  however  no national laws govern offshore aquaculture in u s  exclusive economic zone waters  in june       the department of commerce and national oceanic and atmospheric administration released national aquaculture policies to address this issue and  to meet the growing demand for healthy seafood  to create jobs in coastal communities  and restore vital ecosystems   in       congresswoman lois capps introduced the  national sustainable offshore aquaculture act of        to establish a regulatory system and research program for sustainable offshore aquaculture in the united states exclusive economic zone   however  the bill was not enacted into law 

china overwhelmingly dominates the world in reported aquaculture output  reporting a total output which is double that of the rest of the world put together  however  there are some historical issues with the accuracy of china s returns 

in       the fisheries scientists reg watson and daniel pauly expressed concerns in a letter to  nature   that china was over reporting its catch from wild fisheries in the     s  they said that made it appear that the global catch since      was increasing annually by         tonnes  whereas it was really shrinking annually by         tonnes  watson and pauly suggested this may be have been related to chinese policies where state entities that monitored the economy were also tasked with increasing output  also  until more recently  the promotion of chinese officials was based on production increases from their own areas 

china disputed this claim  the official xinhua news agency quoted yang jian  director general of the agriculture ministry s bureau of fisheries  as saying that china s figures were  basically correct   however  the fao accepted there were issues with the reliability of china s statistical returns  and for a period treated data from china  including the aquaculture data  apart from the rest of the world 

mariculture refers to the cultivation of marine organisms in seawater  usually in sheltered coastal or offshore waters  the farming of marine fish is an example of mariculture  and so also is the farming of marine crustaceans  such as shrimp   molluscs  such as oysters   and seaweed  atlantic salmon and mollusk farms is for example prominent in the u s 

mariculture may consist of raising the organisms on or in artificial enclosures such as in floating netted enclosures for salmon and on racks for oysters  in the case of enclosed salmon  they are fed by the operators  oysters on racks filter feed on naturally available food  abalone have been farmed on an artificial reef consuming seaweed which grows naturally on the reef units 

integrated multi trophic aquaculture  imta  is a practice in which the byproducts  wastes  from one species are recycled to become inputs  fertilizers  food  for another  fed aquaculture  for example  fish  shrimp  is combined with inorganic extractive and organic extractive  for example  shellfish  aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability  biomitigation   economic stability  product diversification and risk reduction  and social acceptability  better management practices  

 multi trophic  refers to the incorporation of species from different trophic or nutritional levels in the same system  this is one potential distinction from the age old practice of aquatic polyculture  which could simply be the co culture of different fish species from the same trophic level  in this case  these organisms may all share the same biological and chemical processes  with few synergistic benefits  which could potentially lead to significant shifts in the ecosystem  some traditional polyculture systems may  in fact  incorporate a greater diversity of species  occupying several niches  as extensive cultures  low intensity  low management  within the same         a working imta system can result in greater total production based on mutual benefits to the co cultured species and improved ecosystem health  even if the production of individual species is lower than in a monoculture over a short term period 

sometimes the term  integrated aquaculture  is used to describe the integration of monocultures through water transfer  for all intents and purposes  however  the terms  imta  and  integrated aquaculture  differ only in their degree of descriptiveness  aquaponics  fractionated aquaculture  integrated agriculture aquaculture systems  integrated peri urban aquaculture systems  and integrated fisheries aquaculture systems are other variations of the imta concept 

various materials  including nylon  polyester  polypropylene  polyethylene  plastic coated welded wire  rubber  patented rope products  spectra  thorn d  dyneema   galvanized steel and copper are used for netting in aquaculture fish enclosures around the world  all of these materials are selected for a variety of reasons  including design feasibility  material strength  cost  and corrosion resistance 
recently  copper alloys have become important netting materials in aquaculture because they are antimicrobial  i e   they destroy bacteria  viruses  fungi  algae  and other microbes  and they therefore prevent biofouling  i e   the undesirable accumulation  adhesion  and growth of microorganisms  plants  algae  tubeworms  barnacles  mollusks  and other organisms   by inhibiting microbial growth  copper alloy aquaculture cages avoid costly net changes that are necessary with other materials  the resistance of organism growth on copper alloy nets also provides a cleaner and healthier environment for farmed fish to grow and thrive 

if performed without consideration for potential local environmental impacts  aquaculture in inland waters can result in more environmental damaging than wild fisheries  though with less waste produced on a per kg on a global scale  local concerns with aquaculture in inland waters may include waste handling  side effects of antibiotics  competition between farmed and wild animals  and the potential introduction of invasive plant and animal species  or foreign pathogens  particularly if unprocessed fish are used to feed more marketable carnivorous fish  if non local live feeds are used  aquaculture may introduce plant of animal  improvements in methods resulting from advances in research and the availability of commercial feeds has reduced some of these concerns since their greater prevalence in the     s and     s  

fish waste is organic and composed of nutrients necessary in all components of aquatic food webs  in ocean aquaculture often produces much higher than normal fish waste concentrations  the waste collects on the ocean bottom  damaging or eliminating bottom dwelling life  waste can also decrease dissolved oxygen levels in the water column  putting further pressure on wild animals  an alternative model to food being added to the ecosystem  is the installation of artificial reef structures to increase the habitat niches available  without the need to add any more than ambient feed and nutrient  this has been used in the  ranching  of abalone in western australia 

tilapia from aquaculture has been shown to contain more fat and a much higher ratio of omega   to omega   oils 

some carnivorous and omnivorous farmed fish species are fed wild forage fish  although carnivorous farmed fish represented only    percent of aquaculture production by weight in       they represented    percent of aquaculture production by value 

farming of carnivorous species like salmon and shrimp leads to a high demand for forage fish to match the nutrition they get in the wild  fish do not actually produce omega   fatty acids  but instead accumulate them from either consuming microalgae that produce these fatty acids  as is the case with forage fish like herring and sardines  or  as is the case with fatty predatory fish  like salmon  by eating prey fish that have accumulated omega   fatty acids from microalgae  to satisfy this requirement  more than    percent of the world fish oil production is fed to farmed salmon 

farmed salmon consume more wild fish than they generate as a final product  although the efficiency of production is improving  to produce one pound of farmed salmon  products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them   this can be described as the  fish in fish out   fifo  ratio  in       salmon had a fifo ratio of      meaning     pounds of wild fish feed were required to produce   pound of salmon   by      the ratio had fallen to      additionally  a growing share of fish oil and fishmeal come from residues  byproducts of fish processing   rather than dedicated whole fish  in          percent of fish oil and    percent of fishmeal came from residues  however  fishmeal and oil from residues instead of whole fish have a different composition with more ash and less protein  which may limit its potential use for aquaculture 

as the salmon farming industry expands  it requires more wild forage fish for feed  at a time when seventy five percent of the worlds monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield  the industrial scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming then impacts the survivability of the wild predator fish who rely on them for food  an important step in reducing the impact of aquaculture on wild fish is shifting carnivorous species to plant based feeds  salmon feeds  for example  have gone from containing only fishmeal and oil to containing    percent plant protein  the usda has also experimented with using grain based feeds for farmed trout  when properly formulated  and often mixed with fishmeal or oil   plant based feeds can provide proper nutrition and similar growth rates in carnivorous farmed fish 

another impact aquaculture production can have on wild fish is the risk of fish escaping from coastal pens  where they can interbreed with their wild counterparts  diluting wild genetic stocks  escaped fish can become invasive  out competing native species 

aquaculture is becoming a significant threat to coastal ecosystems  about    percent of mangrove forests have been destroyed since       partly due to shrimp farming  an extended cost   benefit analysis of the total economic value of shrimp aquaculture built on mangrove ecosystems found that the external costs were much higher than the external benefits  over four decades  of indonesian mangroves have been converted to shrimp farms  most of these farms are abandoned within a decade because of the toxin build up and nutrient loss 

salmon farms are typically sited in pristine coastal ecosystems which they then pollute  a farm with         salmon discharges more fecal waste than a city of        people  this waste is discharged directly into the surrounding aquatic environment  untreated  often containing antibiotics and pesticides   there is also an accumulation of heavy metals on the benthos  seafloor  near the salmon farms  particularly copper and zinc 

in       mass fish kill events impacted salmon farmers along chile s coast and the wider ecology  increases in aquaculture production and its associated effluent were considered to be possible contributing factors to fish and molluscan mortality 

sea cage aquaculture is responsible for nutrient enrichment of the waters in which they are established  this results from fish wastes and uneaten feed inputs  elements of most concern are nitrogen and phosphorus which can promote algal growth  including harmful algal blooms which can be toxic to fish  flushing times  current speeds  distance from the shore and water depth are important considerations when locating sea cages in order to minimize the impacts of nutrient enrichment on coastal ecosystems 

the extent of the effects of pollution from sea cage aquaculture varies depending on where the cages are located  which species are kept  how densely cages are stocked and what the fish are fed  important species specific variables include the species  food conversion ratio  fcr  and nitrogen retention  studies prior to      determined that the amount of nitrogen introduced as feed which is lost to the water column and seafloor as waste varies from    to     

a type of salmon called the aquadvantage salmon has been genetically modified for faster growth  although it has not been approved for commercial use  due to controversy  the altered salmon incorporates a growth hormone from a chinook salmon that allows it to reach full size in         months  instead of the normal    months for atlantic salmon  and while consuming    percent less feed  the u s  food and drug administration reviewed the aquadvantage salmon in a draft environmental assessment and determined that it  would not have a significant impact  fonsi  on the u s  environment  

while some forms of aquaculture can be devastating to ecosystems  such as shrimp farming in mangroves  other forms can be very beneficial  shellfish aquaculture adds substantial filter feeding capacity to an environment which can significantly improve water quality  a single oyster can filter    gallons of water a day  removing microscopic algal cells  by removing these cells  shellfish are removing nitrogen and other nutrients from the system and either retaining it or releasing it as waste which sinks to the bottom  by harvesting these shellfish the nitrogen they retained is completely removed from the system  raising and harvesting kelp and other macroalgae directly remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus  repackaging these nutrients can relieve eutrophic  or nutrient rich  conditions known for their low dissolved oxygen which can decimate species diversity and abundance of marine life  removing algal cells from the water also increase light penetration  allowing plants such as eelgrass to reestablish themselves and further increase oxygen levels 

aquaculture in an area can provide for crucial ecological functions for the inhabitants  shellfish beds or cages can provide habitat structure  this structure can be used as shelter by invertebrates  small fish or crustaceans to potentially increase their abundance and maintain biodiversity  increased shelter raises stocks of prey fish and small crustaceans by increasing recruitment opportunities in turn providing more prey for higher trophic levels  one study estimated that    square meters of oyster reef could enhance an ecosystem s biomass by       kg the shellfish acting as herbivores will also be preyed on  this moves energy directly from primary producers to higher trophic levels potentially skipping out on multiple energetically costly trophic jumps which would increase biomass in the ecosystem 

as with the farming of terrestrial animals  social attitudes influence the need for humane practices and regulations in farmed marine animals  under the guidelines advised by the farm animal welfare council good animal welfare means both fitness and a sense of well being in the animal s physical and mental state  this can be defined by the five freedoms 

however  the controversial issue in aquaculture is whether fish and farmed marine invertebrates are actually sentient  or have the perception and awareness to experience suffering  although no evidence of this has been found in marine invertebrates  recent studies conclude that fish do have the necessary receptors  nociceptors  to sense noxious stimuli and so are likely to experience states of pain  fear and stress  consequently  welfare in aquaculture is directed at vertebrates  finfish in particular 

welfare in aquaculture can be impacted by a number of issues such as stocking densities  behavioural interactions  disease and parasitism  a major problem in determining the cause of impaired welfare is that these issues are often all interrelated and influence each other at different times 

optimal stocking density is often defined by the carrying capacity of the stocked environment and the amount of individual space needed by the fish  which is very species specific  although behavioural interactions such as shoaling may mean that high stocking densities are beneficial to some species  in many cultured species high stocking densities may be of concern  crowding can constrain normal swimming behaviour  as well as increase aggressive and competitive behaviours such as cannibalism  feed competition  territoriality and dominance subordination hierarchies  this potentially increases the risk of tissue damage due to abrasion from fish to fish contact or fish to cage contact  fish can suffer reductions in food intake and food conversion efficiency  in addition  high stocking densities can result in water flow being insufficient  creating inadequate oxygen supply and waste product removal  dissolved oxygen is essential for fish respiration and concentrations below critical levels can induce stress and even lead to asphyxiation  ammonia  a nitrogen excretion product  is highly toxic to fish at accumulated levels  particularly when oxygen concentrations are low 

many of these interactions and effects cause stress in the fish  which can be a major factor in facilitating fish disease  for many parasites  infestation depends on the host s degree of mobility  the density of the host population and vulnerability of the host s defence system  sea lice are the primary parasitic problem for finfish in aquaculture  high numbers causing widespread skin erosion and haemorrhaging  gill congestion  and increased mucus production  there are also a number of prominent viral and bacterial pathogens that can have severe effects on internal organs and nervous systems 

the key to improving welfare of marine cultured organisms is to reduce stress to a minimum  as prolonged or repeated stress can cause a range of adverse effects  attempts to minimise stress can occur throughout the culture process  during grow out it is important to keep stocking densities at appropriate levels specific to each species  as well as separating size classes and grading to reduce aggressive behavioural interactions  keeping nets and cages clean can assist positive water flow to reduce the risk of water degradation 

not surprisingly disease and parasitism can have a major effect on fish welfare and it is important for farmers not only to manage infected stock but also to apply disease prevention measures  however  prevention methods  such as vaccination  can also induce stress because of the extra handling and injection  other methods include adding antibiotics to feed  adding chemicals into water for treatment baths and biological control  such as using cleaner wrasse to remove lice from farmed salmon 

many steps are involved in transport  including capture  food deprivation to reduce faecal contamination of transport water  transfer to transport vehicle via nets or pumps  plus transport and transfer to the delivery location  during transport water needs to be maintained to a high quality  with regulated temperature  sufficient oxygen and minimal waste products  in some cases anaesthetics may be used in small doses to calm fish before transport 

aquaculture is sometimes part of an environmental rehabilitation program or as an aid in conserving endangered species 

global wild fisheries are in decline  with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition  the aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish  like salmon  does not help the problem because they need to eat products from other fish  such as fish meal and fish oil  studies have shown that salmon farming has major negative impacts on wild salmon  as well as the forage fish that need to be caught to feed them  fish that are higher on the food chain are less efficient sources of food energy 

apart from fish and shrimp  some aquaculture undertakings  such as seaweed and filter feeding bivalve mollusks like oysters  clams  mussels and scallops  are relatively benign and even environmentally restorative  filter feeders filter pollutants as well as nutrients from the water  improving water quality  seaweeds extract nutrients such as inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus directly from the water  and filter feeding mollusks can extract nutrients as they feed on particulates  such as phytoplankton and detritus 

some profitable aquaculture cooperatives promote sustainable practices  new methods lessen the risk of biological and chemical pollution through minimizing fish stress  fallowing netpens  and applying integrated pest management  vaccines are being used more and more to reduce antibiotic use for disease control 

onshore recirculating aquaculture systems  facilities using polyculture techniques  and properly sited facilities  for example  offshore areas with strong currents  are examples of ways to manage negative environmental effects 

recirculating aquaculture systems  ras  recycle water by circulating it through filters to remove fish waste and food and then recirculating it back into the tanks  this saves water and the waste gathered can be used in compost or  in some cases  could even be treated and used on land  while ras was developed with freshwater fish in mind  scientist associated with the agricultural research service have found a way to rear saltwater fish using ras in low salinity waters  although saltwater fish are raised in off shore cages or caught with nets in water that typically has a salinity of    parts per thousand  ppt   scientists were able to produce healthy pompano  a saltwater fish  in tanks with a salinity of only   ppt  commercializing low salinity ras are predicted to have positive environmental and economical effects  unwanted nutrients from the fish food would not be added to the ocean and the risk of transmitting diseases between wild and farm raised fish would greatly be reduced  the price of expensive saltwater fish  such as the pompano and combia used in the experiments  would be reduced  however  before any of this can be done researchers must study every aspect of the fish s lifecycle  including the amount of ammonia and nitrate the fish will tolerate in the water  what to feed the fish during each stage of its lifecycle  the stocking rate that will produce the healthiest fish  etc 

some    countries now use geothermal energy for aquaculture  including china  israel  and the united states  in california  for example     fish farms produce tilapia  bass  and catfish with warm water from underground  this warmer water enables fish to grow all year round and mature more quickly  collectively these california farms produce     million kilograms of fish each year

kolmogorov complexity

in algorithmic information theory  a subfield of computer science and mathematics   the kolmogorov complexity of an object  such as a piece of text  is the length of the shortest computer program  in a predetermined programming language  that produces the object as output  it is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object  and is also known as descriptive complexity  kolmogorov   chaitin complexity  algorithmic complexity  algorithmic entropy  or program size complexity  it is named after andrey kolmogorov  who first published on the subject in      

the notion of kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and prove impossibility results akin to cantor s diagonal argument  g  del s incompleteness theorem  and turing s halting problem 
in particular  for almost all objects  it is not possible to compute even a lower bound for its kolmogorov complexity  chaitin        let alone its exact value 

consider the following two strings of    lowercase letters and digits 

the first string has a short english language description  namely  ab    times   which consists of    characters  the second one has no obvious simple description  using the same character set  other than writing down the string itself  which has    characters 

more formally  the complexity of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string in some fixed universal description language  the sensitivity of complexity relative to the choice of description language is discussed below   it can be shown that the kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself  strings like the  abab  example above  whose kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the string s size  are not considered to be complex 

the kolmogorov complexity can be defined for any mathematical object  but for simplicity the scope of this article is restricted to strings  we must first specify a description language for strings  such a description language can be based on any computer programming language  such as lisp  pascal  or java virtual machine bytecode  if p is a program which outputs a string  x   then p is a description of  x   the length of the description is just the length of p as a character string  multiplied by the number of bits in a character  e g    for ascii  

we could  alternatively  choose an encoding for turing machines  where an  encoding  is a function which associates to each turing machine m a bitstring   if m is a turing machine which  on input  w   outputs string  x   then the concatenated string   w  is a description of  x   for theoretical analysis  this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is generally preferred in the research literature  in this article  an informal approach is discussed 

any string  s  has at least one description  for example  the second string above is output by the program 

where the first string is output by the  much shorter  pseudo code 

if a description  d   s   of a string  s  is of minimal length  i e  it uses the fewest bits   it is called a minimal description of  s   thus  the length of  d   s    i e  the number of bits in the description  is the kolmogorov complexity of  s   written  k   s    symbolically 

the length of the shortest description will depend on the choice of description language  but the effect of changing languages is bounded  a result called the  invariance theorem    the standard textbook is authored by ming li and paul vitanyi 
in the references 

there are some description languages which are optimal  in the following sense  given any description of an object in a description language  said description may be used in the optimal description language with a constant overhead  the constant depends only on the languages involved  not on the description of the object  nor the object being described 

here is an example of an optimal description language  a description will have two parts 


in more technical terms  the first part of a description is a computer program  with the second part being the input to that computer program which produces the object as output 

the invariance theorem follows  given any description language  l   the optimal description language is at least as efficient as  l   with some constant overhead 

proof  any description  d  in  l  can be converted into a description in the optimal language by first describing  l  as a computer program  p   part     and then using the original description  d  as input to that program  part     the
total length of this new description  d     is  approximately  

the length of  p  is a constant that doesn t depend on  d   so  there is at most a constant overhead  regardless of the object described  therefore  the optimal language is universal up to this additive constant 

theorem  if  k  and  k  are the complexity functions relative to turing complete description languages  l  and  l   then there is a constant  c       which depends only on the languages  l  and  l  chosen      such that

proof  by symmetry  it suffices to prove that there is some constant  c  such that for all strings  s 

now  suppose there is a program in the language  l  which acts as an interpreter for  l  

where  p  is a program in  l   the interpreter is characterized by the following property 

thus  if p is a program in  l  which is a minimal description of  s   then codice   p  returns the string  s   the length of this description of  s  is the sum of


this proves the desired upper bound 

algorithmic information theory is the area of computer science that studies kolmogorov complexity and other complexity measures on strings  or other data structures  

the concept and theory of kolmogorov complexity is based on a crucial theorem first discovered by ray solomonoff  who published it in       describing it in  a preliminary report on a general theory of inductive inference  as part of his invention of algorithmic probability  he gave a more complete description in his      publications   a formal theory of inductive inference   part   and part   in  information and control  

andrey kolmogorov later independently published this theorem in  problems inform  transmission  in       gregory chaitin also presents this theorem in  j  acm       chaitin s paper was submitted october      and revised in december       and cites both solomonoff s and kolmogorov s papers 

the theorem says that  among algorithms that decode strings from their descriptions  codes   there exists an optimal one  this algorithm  for all strings  allows codes as short as allowed by any other algorithm up to an additive constant that depends on the algorithms  but not on the strings themselves  solomonoff used this algorithm  and the code lengths it allows  to define a  universal probability  of a string on which inductive inference of the subsequent digits of the string can be based  kolmogorov used this theorem to define several functions of strings  including complexity  randomness  and information 

when kolmogorov became aware of solomonoff s work  he acknowledged solomonoff s priority  for several years  solomonoff s work was better known in the soviet union than in the western world  the general consensus in the scientific community  however  was to associate this type of complexity with kolmogorov  who was concerned with randomness of a sequence  while algorithmic probability became associated with solomonoff  who focused on prediction using his invention of the universal prior probability distribution  the broader area encompassing descriptional complexity and probability is often called kolmogorov complexity  the computer scientist ming li considers this an example of the matthew effect      to everyone who has more will be given    

there are several other variants of kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information  the most widely used one is based on self delimiting programs  and is mainly due to leonid levin        

an axiomatic approach to kolmogorov complexity based on blum axioms  blum       was introduced by mark burgin in the paper presented for publication by andrey kolmogorov 

in the following discussion  let  k   s   be the complexity of the string  s  

it is not hard to see that the minimal description of a string cannot be too much larger than the string itself      the program codice   above that outputs  s  is a fixed amount larger than  s  

theorem  there is a constant  c  such that

theorem  there exist strings of arbitrarily large kolmogorov complexity  formally  for each  n           there is a string  s  with  k   s        n  

proof  otherwise all of the infinitely many possible finite strings could be generated by the finitely many programs with a complexity below  n  bits 

theorem   k  is not a computable function  in other words  there is no program which takes a string  s  as input and produces the integer  k   s   as output 

the following indirect proof uses a simple pascal like language to denote programs  for sake of proof simplicity assume its description  i e  an interpreter  to have a length of bits 
assume for contradiction there is a program

which takes as input a string  s  and returns  k   s    for sake of proof simplicity  assume the program s length to be bits 
now  consider the following program of length bits 

using codice   as a subroutine  the program tries every string  starting with the shortest  until it returns a string with kolmogorov complexity at least bits  i e  a string that cannot be produced by any program shorter than bits  however  the overall length of the above program that produced  s  is only bits  which is a contradiction   if the code of codice   is shorter  the contradiction remains  if it is longer  the constant used in codice   can always be changed appropriately  

the above proof uses a contradiction similar to that of the berry paradox   the smallest positive integer that cannot be defined in fewer than twenty english words   it is also possible to show the non computability of  k  by reduction from the non computability of the halting problem  h   since  k  and  h  are turing equivalent 

there is a corollary  humorously called the  full employment theorem  in the programming language community  stating that there is no perfect size optimizing compiler 

at first glance it might seem trivial to write a program which can compute  k   s   for any  s   thus disproving the above theorem   such as the following 

this program iterates through all possible programs  by iterating through all possible strings and only considering those which are valid programs   starting with the shortest  each program is executed to find the result produced by that program  comparing it to the input  s   if the result matches the length of the program is returned 

however this will not work because some of the programs  p  tested will not terminate  e g  if they contain infinite loops  there is no way to avoid all of these programs by testing them in some way before executing them due to the non computability of the halting problem 

the chain rule for kolmogorov complexity states that

it states that the shortest program that reproduces  x  and  y  is no more than a logarithmic term larger than a program to reproduce  x  and a program to reproduce  y  given  x   using this statement  one can define an analogue of mutual information for kolmogorov complexity 

it is straightforward to compute upper bounds for  k   s        simply compress the string  s  with some method  implement the corresponding decompressor in the chosen language  concatenate the decompressor to the compressed string  and measure the length of the resulting string      concretely  the size of a self extracting archive in the given language 

a string  s  is compressible by a number  c  if it has a description whose length does not exceed   s        c  bits  this is equivalent to saying that  k   s         s        c   otherwise   s  is incompressible by  c   a string incompressible by   is said to be simply  incompressible       by the pigeonhole principle  which applies because every compressed string maps to only one uncompressed string  incompressible strings must exist  since there are   bit strings of length  n   but only         shorter strings  that is  strings of length less than  n    i e  with length             n          

for the same reason  most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be significantly compressed      their  k   s   is not much smaller than   s    the length of  s  in bits  to make this precise  fix a value of  n   there are   bitstrings of length  n   the uniform probability distribution on the space of these bitstrings assigns exactly equal weight   to each string of length  n  

theorem  with the uniform probability distribution on the space of bitstrings of length  n   the probability that a string is incompressible by  c  is at least             

to prove the theorem  note that the number of descriptions of length not exceeding  n       c  is given by the geometric series 

there remain at least

bitstrings of length  n  that are incompressible by  c   to determine the probability  divide by   

we know that  in the set of all possible strings  most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be described in any significantly  compressed  way  however  it turns out that the fact that a specific string is complex cannot be formally proven  if the complexity of the string is above a certain threshold  the precise formalization is as follows  first  fix a particular axiomatic system s for the natural numbers  the axiomatic system has to be powerful enough so that  to certain assertions a about complexity of strings  one can associate a formula f in s  this association must have the following property 

if f is provable from the axioms of s  then the corresponding assertion a must be true  this  formalization  can be achieved  either by an artificial encoding such as a g  del numbering  or by a formalization which more clearly respects the intended interpretation of s 

theorem  there exists a constant  l   which only depends on the particular axiomatic system and the choice of description language  such that there does not exist a string  s  for which the statement

can be proven within the axiomatic system s 

note that  by the abundance of nearly incompressible strings  the vast majority of those statements must be true 

the proof of this result is modeled on a self referential construction used in berry s paradox  the proof is by contradiction  if the theorem were false  then

we can find an effective enumeration of all the formal proofs in s by some procedure

which takes as input  n  and outputs some proof  this function enumerates all proofs  some of these are proofs for formulas we do not care about here  since every possible proof in the language of s is produced for some  n   some of these are complexity formulas of the form  k   s          n  where  s  and  n  are constants in the language of s  there is a program

which determines whether the  n th proof actually proves a complexity formula  k   s          l   the strings  s   and the integer  l  in turn  are computable by programs 

consider the following program

given an  n   this program tries every proof until it finds a string and a proof in the formal system s of the formula  k   s          l  for some  l         n   the program terminates by our assumption  x   now  this program has a length  u   there is an integer  n  such that  u      log  n        c       n   where  c  is the overhead cost of

 note that  n  is hard coded into the above function  and the summand log  n   already allows for its encoding   the program generateprovablyparadoxicalstring outputs a string  s  for which there exists an  l  such that  k   s          l  can be formally proved in s with  l         n   in particular   k   s          n  is true  however   s  is also described by a program of length  u      log  n        c   so its complexity is less than  n   this contradiction proves assumption  x  cannot hold 

similar ideas are used to prove the properties of chaitin s constant 

the minimum message length principle of statistical and inductive inference and machine learning was developed by c s  wallace and d m  boulton in       mml is bayesian  i e  it incorporates prior beliefs  and information theoretic  it has the desirable properties of statistical invariance  i e  the inference transforms with a re parametrisation  such as from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates   statistical consistency  i e  even for very hard problems  mml will converge to any underlying model  and efficiency  i e  the mml model will converge to any true underlying model about as quickly as is possible   c s  wallace and d l  dowe        showed a formal connection between mml and algorithmic information theory  or kolmogorov complexity  

 kolmogorov randomness  defines a string  usually of bits  as being random if and only if it is shorter than any computer program that can produce that string  to make this precise  a universal computer  or universal turing machine  must be specified  so that  program  means a program for this universal machine  a random string in this sense is  incompressible  in that it is impossible to  compress  the string into a program whose length is shorter than the length of the string itself  a counting argument is used to show that  for any universal computer  there is at least one algorithmically random string of each length  whether any particular string is random  however  depends on the specific universal computer that is chosen 

this definition can be extended to define a notion of randomness for  infinite  sequences from a finite alphabet  these algorithmically random sequences can be defined in three equivalent ways  one way uses an effective analogue of measure theory  another uses effective martingales  the third way defines an infinite sequence to be random if the prefix free kolmogorov complexity of its initial segments grows quickly enough      there must be a constant  c  such that the complexity of an initial segment of length  n  is always at least  n     c   this definition  unlike the definition of randomness for a finite string  is not affected by which universal machine is used to define prefix free kolmogorov complexity 

for dynamical systems  entropy rate and algorithmic complexity of the trajectories are related by a theorem of brudno  that the equality k x t    h t  holds for almost all x 

it can be shown that for the output of markov information sources  kolmogorov complexity is related to the entropy of the information source  more precisely  the kolmogorov complexity of the output of a markov information source  normalized by the length of the output  converges almost surely  as the length of the output goes to infinity  to the entropy of the source 

the notion of kolmogorov complexity has been used to evaluate the complexity of geographical areas from maps or from field observations 

the conditional kolmogorov complexity of two strings formula   is  roughly speaking  defined as the kolmogorov complexity of  x  given  y  as an auxiliary input to the procedure 

there is also a length conditional complexity formula    which is the complexity of  x  given the length of  x  as known input 







hymn to proserpine

   hymn to proserpine    is a poem by algernon charles swinburne  published in  poems and ballads  in       the poem is addressed to the goddess proserpina  the roman equivalent of persephone  but laments the rise of christianity for displacing the pagan goddess and her pantheon 

the epigraph at the beginning of the poem is the phrase  vicisti  galilaee   latin for  you have conquered  o galilean   the apocryphal of the emperor julian  he had tried to reverse the official endorsement of christianity by the roman empire  the poem is cast in the form of a lament by a person professing the paganism of classical antiquity and lamenting its passing  and expresses regret at the rise of christianity  lines    and    express this best 

 thou hast conquered  o pale galilean  the world has grown grey from thy breath  
 we have drunken of things lethean  and fed on the fullness of death  

the line  time and the gods are at strife  inspired the title of lord dunsany s  time and the gods  

the poem is quoted by sue bridehead in thomas hardy s      novel   jude the obscure  and also by edward ashburnham in ford madox ford s  the good soldier  






the triumph of time

 the triumph of time  is a poem by algernon charles swinburne  published in  poems and ballads  in       it is in adapted ottava rima and is full of elaborate use of literary devices  particularly alliteration  the theme  which purports to be autobiographical  is that of rejected love  the speaker deplores the ruin of his life  and in tones at times reminiscent of  hamlet   craves oblivion  for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor

alfred the great

alfred the great       elf counsel  or  wise elf   between     and            october      was king of wessex from     to c      and king of the anglo saxons from c      to      he was the youngest son of king   thelwulf of wessex  his father died when he was young and three of alfred s brothers reigned in turn  alfred took the throne after the death of his brother   thelred and spent several years dealing with viking invasions  he won a decisive victory in the battle of edington in     and made an agreement with the vikings  creating what was known as danelaw in the north of england  alfred also oversaw the conversion of viking leader guthrum  he successfully defended his kingdom against the viking attempt at conquest  and he became the dominant ruler in england  he was also the first king of the west saxons to style himself king of the anglo saxons  details of his life are described in a work by  th century welsh scholar and bishop asser 

alfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level headed nature who encouraged education  proposing that primary education be conducted in english rather than latin  and improving his kingdom s legal system  military structure  and his people s quality of life  he was given the epithet  the great  during and after the reformation in the sixteenth century  the only other king of england given this epithet is cnut the great  in       alfred was ranked number    in the bbc s poll of the     greatest britons 

alfred was born in the royal estate of wantage  historically in berkshire but now in oxfordshire between     and      he was the youngest of five sons of king   thelwulf of wessex by his first wife  osburh 

in     alfred is reported by the  anglo saxon chronicle  to have been sent to rome where he was confirmed by pope leo iv  who  anointed him as king   victorian writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory coronation in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of wessex  this is unlikely  his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as alfred had three living elder brothers  a letter of leo iv shows that alfred was made a  consul   a misinterpretation of this investiture  deliberate or accidental  could explain later confusion  it may also be based on alfred s later having accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to rome where he spent some time at the court of charles the bald  king of the franks  around           

on their return from rome in       thelwulf was deposed by his son   thelbald  with civil war looming the magnates of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise    thelbald would retain the western shires  i e  historical wessex   and   thelwulf would rule in the east  when king   thelwulf died in     wessex was ruled by three of alfred s brothers in succession    thelbald    thelberht and   thelred 

bishop asser tells the story of how as a child alfred won as a prize a book of saxon poems  offered by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it  legend also has it that the young alfred spent time in ireland seeking healing  alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life  it is thought that he may have suffered from crohn s disease  statues of alfred in winchester and wantage portray him as a great warrior  evidence suggests he was not physically strong and  though not lacking in courage  he was noted more for his intellect than as a warlike character 

alfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers   thelbald and   thelberht  the  anglo saxon chronicle  describes the great heathen army of danes landing in east anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms which constituted anglo saxon england in      alfred s public life began in     at age    with the accession of his third brother     year old   thelred  during this period  bishop asser gave alfred the unique title of  secundarius   which may indicate a position similar to the celtic tanist  a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch  this arrangement may have been sanctioned by alfred s father or by the witan to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should   thelred fall in battle  it is well known among other germanic peoples to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander  such as among the swedes and franks  to whom the anglo saxons were closely related 

in      alfred is recorded as fighting beside   thelred in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the great heathen army led by ivar the boneless out of the adjoining kingdom of mercia  the danes arrived in his homeland at the end of      and nine engagements were fought in the following year  with varying outcomes  the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded 

a successful skirmish at the battle of englefield in berkshire on    december     was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and battle of reading by ivar s brother halfdan ragnarsson on   january      four days later  the anglo saxons won a brilliant victory at the battle of ashdown on the berkshire downs  possibly near compton or aldworth  alfred is particularly credited with the success of this last battle  the saxons were defeated at the battle of basing on    january  they were defeated again on    march at the battle of merton  perhaps marden in wiltshire or martin in dorset     thelred died shortly afterwards on    april 

in april     king   thelred died and alfred succeeded to the throne of wessex and the burden of its defence  even though   thelred left two under age sons    thelhelm and   thelwold  this was in accordance with the agreement that   thelred and alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called swinbeorg  the brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that king   thelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will  the deceased s sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them  and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired  the unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king  given the ongoing danish invasion and the youth of his nephews  alfred s accession probably went uncontested 

while he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother  the danes defeated the saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot  and then again in his presence at wilton in may  the defeat at wilton smashed any remaining hope that alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom  he was forced instead to make peace with them  according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were  bishop asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise 

indeed  the viking army did withdraw from reading in the autumn of     to take up winter quarters in mercian london  although not mentioned by asser  or by the  anglo saxon chronicle   alfred probably also paid the vikings cash to leave  much as the mercians were to do in the following year  hoards dating to the viking occupation of london in       have been excavated at croydon  gravesend  and waterloo bridge  these finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the vikings  for the next five years the danes occupied other parts of england 

in     under their new leader  guthrum  the danes slipped past the saxon army and attacked and occupied wareham in dorset  alfred blockaded them but was unable to take wareham by assault  accordingly  he negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths  which the danes swore on a  holy ring  associated with the worship of thor  the danes broke their word and  after killing all the hostages  slipped away under cover of night to exeter in devon 

alfred blockaded the viking ships in devon and  with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm  the danes were forced to submit  the danes withdrew to mercia  in january     the danes made a sudden attack on chippenham  a royal stronghold in which alfred had been staying over christmas   and most of the people they killed  except the king alfred  and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp  and after easter he made a fort at athelney in the marshes of somerset  and from that fort kept fighting against the foe   from his fort at athelney  an island in the marshes near north petherton  alfred was able to mount an effective resistance movement  rallying the local militias from somerset  wiltshire and hampshire 

a legend  originating from   th century chronicles  tells how when he first fled to the somerset levels  alfred was given shelter by a peasant woman who  unaware of his identity  left him to watch some wheaten cakes she had left cooking on the fire  preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom alfred accidentally let the cakes burn and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return 

    was the low water mark in the history of the anglo saxon kingdoms  with all the other kingdoms having fallen to the vikings  wessex alone was still resisting 

in the seventh week after easter         may       around whitsuntide  alfred rode to egbert s stone east of selwood where he was met by  all the people of somerset and of wiltshire and of that part of hampshire which is on this side of the sea  that is  west of southampton water   and they rejoiced to see him   alfred s emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the fyrds of three shires  this meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of ealdormen  royal reeves and king s thegns  who were charged with levying and leading these forces  but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war  alfred s actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers 

alfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing battle of edington which may have been fought near westbury  wiltshire  he then pursued the danes to their stronghold at chippenham and starved them into submission  one of the terms of the surrender was that guthrum convert to christianity  three weeks later the danish king and    of his chief men were baptised at alfred s court at aller  near athelney  with alfred receiving guthrum as his spiritual son 

according to asser 

while at wedmore alfred and guthrum negotiated what some historians have called the treaty of wedmore  but it was to be some years after the cessation of hostilities that a formal treaty was signed  under the terms of the so called treaty of wedmore the converted guthrum was required to leave wessex and return to east anglia  consequently  in     the viking army left chippenham and made its way to cirencester  the formal treaty of alfred and guthrum  preserved in old english in corpus christi college  cambridge  manuscript       and in a latin compilation known as  quadripartitus   was negotiated later  perhaps in     or      when king ceolwulf ii of mercia was deposed 

that treaty divided up the kingdom of mercia  by its terms the boundary between alfred s and guthrum s kingdoms was to run up the river thames to the river lea  follow the lea to its source  near luton   from there extend in a straight line to bedford  and from bedford follow the river ouse to watling street 

in other words  alfred succeeded to ceolwulf s kingdom consisting of western mercia  and guthrum incorporated the eastern part of mercia into an enlarged kingdom of east anglia  henceforward known as the danelaw   by terms of the treaty  moreover  alfred was to have control over the mercian city of london and its mints   at least for the time being  the disposition of essex  held by west saxon kings since the days of egbert  is unclear from the treaty though  given alfred s political and military superiority  it would have been surprising if he had conceded any disputed territory to his new godson 

with the signing of the treaty of alfred and guthrum  an event most commonly held to have taken place around     when guthrum s people began settling east anglia  guthrum was neutralised as a threat  the viking army  which had stayed at fulham during the winter of            sailed for ghent and was active on the continent from           

alfred was still forced to contend with a number of danish threats  a year later  in      alfred fought a small sea battle against four danish ships  on the high seas   two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to alfred s forces  similar small skirmishes with independent viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period  as they had for decades 

in       though there is some debate over the year   king alfred  because of his support and his donation of alms to rome  received a number of gifts from pope marinus  among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the true cross  a great treasure for the devout saxon king  according to asser  because of pope marinus s friendship with king alfred  the pope granted an exemption to any anglo saxons residing within rome from tax or tribute 

after the signing of the treaty with guthrum  alfred was spared any large scale conflicts for some time  despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of danish raids and incursions  among these was a raid in kent  an allied kingdom in south east england  during the year      which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with guthrum  asser s account of the raid places the danish raiders at the saxon city of rochester where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city  in response to this incursion alfred led an anglo saxon force against the danes who  instead of engaging the army of wessex  fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of britain  the retreating danish force supposedly left britain the following summer 

not long after the failed danish raid in kent  alfred dispatched his fleet to east anglia  the purpose of this expedition is debated  though asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder  after travelling up the river stour the fleet was met by danish vessels that numbered    or     sources vary on the number  and a battle ensued  the anglo saxon fleet emerged victorious and  as huntingdon accounts   laden with spoils   the victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the river stour and was attacked by a danish force at the mouth of the river  the danish fleet defeated alfred s fleet  which may have been weakened in the previous engagement 
a year later  in      alfred reoccupied the city of london and set out to make it habitable again  alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son in law   thelred  ealdorman of mercia  the restoration of london progressed through the latter half of the    s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan  added fortifications in addition to the existing roman walls  and  some believe  the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the river thames 

this is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the saxon people of pre unification england submitted to alfred  this was not  however  the point at which alfred came to be known as king of england  in fact  he would never adopt the title for himself 

between the restoration of london and the resumption of large scale danish attacks in the early    s  alfred s reign was rather uneventful  the relative peace of the late    s was marred by the death of alfred s sister    thelswith  en route to rome in      in the same year the archbishop of canterbury    thelred  also died  one year later guthrum  or athelstan by his baptismal name  alfred s former enemy and king of east anglia  died and was buried in hadleigh  suffolk 
guthrum s passing changed the political landscape for alfred  the resulting power vacuum stirred up other power hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years  the quiet years of alfred s life were coming to a close and war was on the horizon 

after another lull  in the autumn of     or      the danes attacked again  finding their position in mainland europe precarious  they crossed to england in     ships in two divisions  they entrenched themselves  the larger body  at appledore  kent  and the lesser under hastein  at milton  also in kent  the invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation  alfred  in     or      took up a position from which he could observe both forces 

while he was in talks with hastein  the danes at appledore broke out and struck northwestwards  they were overtaken by alfred s eldest son  edward  and were defeated in a general engagement at farnham in surrey  they took refuge on an island at thorney  on the river colne between buckinghamshire and middlesex  where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave wessex  they then went to essex and  after suffering another defeat at benfleet  joined with hastein s force at shoebury 

alfred had been on his way to relieve his son at thorney when he heard that the northumbrian and east anglian danes were besieging exeter and an unnamed stronghold on the north devon shore  alfred at once hurried westward and raised the siege of exeter  the fate of the other place is not recorded 

meanwhile  the force under hastein set out to march up the thames valley  possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west  they were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of mercia  wiltshire and somerset and  forced to head off to the northwest  being finally overtaken and blockaded at buttington   some identify this with buttington tump at the mouth of the river wye  others with buttington near welshpool   an attempt to break through the english lines was defeated  those who escaped retreated to shoebury  after collecting reinforcements  they made a sudden dash across england and occupied the ruined roman walls of chester  the english did not attempt a winter blockade but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district 

early in     or     lack of food obliged the danes to retire once more to essex  at the end of the year the danes drew their ships up the river thames and the river lea and fortified themselves north of london  a direct attack on the danish lines failed but  later in the year  alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the danish ships  the danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred  they struck off north westwards and wintered at cwatbridge near bridgnorth  the next year       or       they gave up the struggle  some retired to northumbria  some to east anglia  those who had no connections in england withdrew back to the continent 

the germanic tribes who invaded britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their tribal levy  or fyrd  and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early anglo saxon england depended  the fyrd was a local militia in the anglo saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve  those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land 
according to the law code of king ine of wessex  issued in about     
wessex s history of failures preceding his success in     emphasised to alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the danes  advantage  while both the anglo saxons and the danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources  they employed very different strategies  in their raids the anglo saxons traditionally preferred to attack head on by assembling their forces in a shield wall  advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshalled against them in defence 

in contrast the danes preferred to choose easy targets  mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high stake attacks for more  alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance 

these bases were prepared in advance  often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches  ramparts and palisades  once inside the fortification  alfred realised  the danes enjoyed the advantage  better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned 

the means by which the anglo saxons marshalled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the vikings  it was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids  the king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but  in the case of the viking hit and run raids  problems with communication  and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough  it was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle  large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive  and although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called  during the attacks in     many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with guthrum 

with these lessons in mind alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom s military defences  on a trip to rome alfred had stayed with charles the bald and it is possible that he may have studied how the carolingian kings had dealt with the viking problem  learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom  also there had been a system of fortifications in pre viking mercia that may have been an influence  so when the viking raids resumed in     alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing  mobile field army  a network of garrisons  and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries 

tenants in anglo saxon england had a threefold obligation based on their landholding  the so called  common burdens  of military service  fortress work  and bridge repair  this threefold obligation has traditionally been called  trinoda necessitas  or  trimoda necessitas   the old english name for the fine due for neglecting military service was  

to maintain the burhs  and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army  alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant s landholding  the  hide  was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant s public obligations were assessed  a  hide  is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family  the  hide  would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land  and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many  hides  he owned 

at the centre of alfred s reformed military defence system was the network of  burhs   distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom  there were thirty three in total  spaced approximately apart  enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a single day 

alfred s burhs  later termed  boroughs   ranged from former roman towns  such as winchester  where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added  to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches  probably reinforced with wooden revetments and palisades  such as at burpham in west sussex  the size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as pilton in devon  to large fortifications in established towns  the largest being at winchester 

a contemporary document now known as the  burghal hidage  provides an insight into how the system worked  it lists the  hidage  for each of the fortified towns contained in the document  for example  wallingford had a hidage of       which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding       men  the number sufficient for maintaining of wall  a total of        soldiers were needed system wide  or approximately one in four of all the free men in wessex 

many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge  like those built by charles the bald a generation before  the double burh blocked passage on the river  forcing viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones  spears  or arrows  other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas  allowing the king better control over his strongholds 
the burhs were also interconnected by a road system maintained for army use  known as  herepaths    these roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled  sometimes from more than one burh  to confront the viking invader  this network posed significant obstacles to viking invaders  especially those laden with booty  the system threatened viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for the viking raiders  the vikings lacked both the equipment necessary to undertake a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of siegecraft  having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well defended fortifications  the only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission  but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the well maintained army roads  in such cases the vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king s joint military forces  alfred s burh system posed such a formidable challenge against viking attack that when the vikings returned in      and successfully stormed a half made  poorly garrisoned fortress up the lympne estuary in kent  the anglo saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of wessex and mercia 

alfred s burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution  his contemporary biographer asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for  the common needs of the kingdom  

alfred also tried his hand at naval design  in     he ordered the construction of a small fleet  perhaps a dozen or so longships that  at    oars  were twice the size of viking warships  this was not  as the victorians asserted  the birth of the english navy  wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this  king athelstan of kent and ealdorman ealhhere had defeated a viking fleet in     capturing nine ships  and alfred himself had conducted naval actions in     

nevertheless      clearly marked an important development in the naval power of wessex  the author of the  anglo saxon chronicle  related that alfred s ships were larger  swifter  steadier and rode higher in the water than either danish or frisian ships  it is probable that  under the classical tutelage of asser  alfred utilised the design of greek and roman warships  with high sides  designed for fighting rather than for navigation 

alfred had seapower in mind   if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed  he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged  alfred s ships may have been superior in conception  in practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers  the only places in which a naval battle could occur 

the warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers  it has been suggested that  like sea battles in late viking age scandinavia  these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel  lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft  the result was effectively a land battle involving hand to hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels 

in the one recorded naval engagement in     alfred s new fleet of nine ships intercepted six viking ships at the mouth of an unidentified river in the south of england  the danes had beached half their ships and gone inland  alfred s ships immediately moved to block their escape  the three viking ships afloat attempted to break through the english lines  only one made it  alfred s ships intercepted the other two  lashing the viking boats to their own  the english crew boarded and proceeded to kill the vikings  one ship escaped  because alfred s heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out  a land battle ensued between the crews  the danes were heavily outnumbered  but as the tide rose they returned to their boats which  with shallower drafts  were freed first  the english watched as the vikings rowed past them  but they had suffered so many casualties      dead against    frisians and english  that they had difficulty putting out to sea  all were too damaged to row around sussex and two were driven against the sussex coast  possibly at selsey bill   the shipwrecked crew were brought before alfred at winchester and hanged 

in the late    s or early    s  alfred issued a long  domboc  or law code consisting of his own laws  followed by a code issued by his late seventh century predecessor king ine of wessex  together these laws are arranged into     chapters  in his introduction alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many  synod books  and  ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed   those that pleased me  and many of the ones that did not please me  i rejected with the advice of my councillors  and commanded them to be observed in a different way  

alfred singled out in particular the laws that he  found in the days of ine  my kinsman  or offa  king of the mercians  or king   thelberht of kent who first among the english people received baptism   he appended  rather than integrated  the laws of ine into his code and although he included  as had   thelbert  a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts  the two injury tariffs are not aligned  offa is not known to have issued a law code  leading historian patrick wormald to speculate that alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of     that was presented to offa by two papal legates 

about a fifth of the law code is taken up by alfred s introduction which includes translations into english of the ten commandments  a few chapters from the book of exodus  and the apostolic letter from the acts of the apostles               the introduction may best be understood as alfred s meditation upon the meaning of christian law  it traces the continuity between god s gift of law to moses to alfred s own issuance of law to the west saxon people  by doing so  it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented alfred s law giving as a type of divine legislation 

similarly alfred divided his code into     chapters because     was the age at which moses died and  in the number symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes      stood for law  the link between mosaic law and alfred s code is the apostolic letter which explained that christ  had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them  and he taught mercy and meekness    intro        the mercy that christ infused into mosaic law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since christian synods  established  through that mercy which christ taught  that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed  

the only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord   since almighty god adjudged none for those who despised him  nor did christ  the son of god  adjudge any for the one who betrayed him to death  and he commanded everyone to love his lord as himself   alfred s transformation of christ s commandment  from  love your neighbour as yourself   matt              to love your secular lord as you would love the lord christ himself  underscores the importance that alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by god for the governance of man 

when one turns from the  domboc  s introduction to the laws themselves  it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement  the impression is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws  the law code  as it has been preserved  is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits  in fact  several of alfred s laws contradicted the laws of ine that form an integral part of the code  patrick wormald s explanation is that alfred s law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship  designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction   in practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first   we enjoin  what is most necessary  that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge  which expresses a fundamental tenet of anglo saxon law 

alfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters  asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness  alfred  according to asser  insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and  would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed  issued  in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust   a charter from the reign of his son edward the elder depicts alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands 

asser represents alfred as a solomonic judge  painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments  although asser never mentions alfred s law code he does say that alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves  to the pursuit of wisdom   the failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office 

the  anglo saxon chronicle   commissioned at the time of alfred  was probably written to promote unification of england  whereas asser s  the life of king alfred  promoted alfred s achievements and personal qualities  it was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in wales  as alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country 

asser speaks grandiosely of alfred s relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available  his interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of orosius  he corresponded with elias iii  the patriarch of jerusalem  and embassies to rome conveying the english alms to the pope were fairly frequent  around      wulfstan of hedeby undertook a journey from hedeby on jutland along the baltic sea to the prussian trading town of truso  alfred personally collected details of this trip 

alfred s relations with the celtic princes in the western half of britain are clearer  comparatively early in his reign  according to asser  the southern welsh princes  owing to the pressure on them from north wales and mercia  commended themselves to alfred  later in his reign the north welsh followed their example and the latter cooperated with the english in the campaign of      or       that alfred sent alms to irish and continental monasteries may be taken on asser s authority  the visit of three pilgrim  scots   i e  irish  to alfred in     is undoubtedly authentic  the story that he himself in his childhood was sent to ireland to be healed by saint modwenna  though mythical  may show alfred s interest in that island 

in the    s  at the same time that he was  cajoling and threatening  his nobles to build and man the burhs  alfred  perhaps inspired by the example of charlemagne almost a century before  undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning  during this time period the viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment and alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease god s wrath 

this revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from mercia  wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the episcopacy  the establishment of a court school to educate his own children  the sons of his nobles  and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth  an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority  a series of translations into the vernacular of latin works the king deemed  most necessary for all men to know   the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of alfred s kingdom and house  with a genealogy that stretched back to adam  thus giving the west saxon kings a biblical ancestry 

very little is known of the church under alfred  the danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries  although alfred founded monasteries at athelney and shaftesbury  these were the first new monastic houses in wessex since the beginning of the eighth century  according to asser  alfred enticed foreign monks to england for his monastery at athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life 

alfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in wessex  for him the key to the kingdom s spiritual revival was to appoint pious  learned  and trustworthy bishops and abbots  as king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects  secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for alfred 

he was equally comfortable distributing his translation of gregory the great s  pastoral care  to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges  nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands  especially estates along the border with the danelaw  and transferring them to royal thegns and officials who could better defend them against viking attacks 

the danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in england  alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of gregory s  pastoral care  that  learning had declined so thoroughly in england that there were very few men on this side of the humber who could understand their divine services in english or even translate a single letter from latin into english  and i suppose that there were not many beyond the humber either   alfred undoubtedly exaggerated  for dramatic effect  the abysmal state of learning in england during his youth  that latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned mercian and west saxon clerics such as plegmund  w  ferth  and wulfsige 

manuscript production in england dropped off precipitously around the    s when the viking invasions began in earnest  not to be revived until the end of the century  numerous anglo saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them  and a solemn diploma from christ church  canterbury  dated      is so poorly constructed and written that historian nicholas brooks posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote or who knew little or no latin   it is clear   brooks concludes   that the metropolitan church  of canterbury  must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in christian worship  

following the example of charlemagne  alfred established a court school for the education of his own children  those of the nobility  and  a good many of lesser birth   there they studied books in both english and latin and  devoted themselves to writing  to such an extent     they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts   he recruited scholars from the continent and from britain to aid in the revival of christian learning in wessex and to provide the king personal instruction  grimbald and john the saxon came from francia  plegmund  whom alfred appointed archbishop of canterbury in       bishop werferth of worcester    thelstan  and the royal chaplains werwulf  from mercia  and asser  from st david s in southwestern wales 

alfred s educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school  believing that without christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war  alfred aimed  to set to learning  as long as they are not useful for some other employment  all the free born young men now in england who have the means to apply themselves to it   conscious of the decay of latin literacy in his realm alfred proposed that primary education be taught in english  with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in latin 

there were few  books of wisdom  written in english  alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court centred programme of translating into english the books he deemed  most necessary for all men to know   it is unknown when alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the    s when wessex was enjoying a respite from viking attacks  alfred was  until recently  often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases  scholars more often refer to translations as  alfredian  indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work 

apart from the lost  handboc  or  encheiridio   which seems to have been a commonplace book kept by the king  the earliest work to be translated was the  dialogues  of gregory the great  a book greatly popular in the middle ages  the translation was undertaken at alfred s command by werferth  bishop of worcester  with the king merely furnishing a preface  remarkably  alfred     undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars     translated four works himself  gregory the great s  pastoral care   boethius s  consolation of philosophy   st  augustine s  soliloquies  and the first fifty psalms of the psalter 

one might add to this list the translation  in alfred s law code  of excerpts from the vulgate book of exodus  the old english versions of orosius s  histories against the pagans  and bede s  ecclesiastical history of the english people  are no longer accepted by scholars as alfred s own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences  nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the alfredian programme of translation  simon keynes and michael lapidge suggest this also for bald s  leechbook  and the anonymous  old english martyrology  

the preface of alfred s translation of pope gregory the great s  pastoral care  explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from latin into english  although he described his method as translating  sometimes word for word  sometimes sense for sense   the translation actually keeps very close to the original although  through his choice of language  he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority  alfred meant the translation to be used  and circulated it to all his bishops  interest in alfred s translation of  pastoral care  was so enduring that copies were still being made in the   th century 

boethius s  consolation of philosophy  was the most popular philosophical handbook of the middle ages  unlike the translation of the  pastoral care  the alfredian text deals very freely with the original and  though the late dr  g  schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself but to the glosses and commentaries which he used  still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in alfred s milieu  it is in the boethius that the oft quoted sentence occurs   to speak briefly  i desired to live worthily as long as i lived  and after my life to leave to them that should come after  my memory in good works   the book has come down to us in two manuscripts only  in one of these the writing is prose  in the other a combination of prose and alliterating verse  the latter manuscript was severely damaged in the   th and   th centuries 

the last of the alfredian works is one which bears the name  blostman    blooms   or  anthology   the first half is based mainly on the  soliloquies  of st augustine of hippo  the remainder is drawn from various sources  the material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is alfred s own and highly characteristic of him  the last words of it may be quoted  they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of english kings   therefore  he seems to me a very foolish man  and truly wretched  who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world  and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear   alfred appears as a character in the twelfth  or thirteenth century poem  the owl and the nightingale  where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised   the proverbs of alfred   a thirteenth century work  contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom 

the alfred jewel  discovered in somerset in       has long been associated with king alfred because of its old english inscription aelfred mec heht gewyrcan   alfred ordered me to be made    the jewel is about long  made of filigreed gold  enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonn   enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres  perhaps personifying sight or the wisdom of god 

it was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base  the jewel certainly dates from alfred s reign  although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the    stels    pointers for reading   that alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the  pastoral care   each    stel  was worth the princely sum of    mancuses which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the alfred jewel 

historian richard abels sees alfred s educational and military reforms as complementary  restoring religion and learning in wessex  abels contends  was to alfred s mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs  as alfred observed in the preface to his english translation of gregory the great s  pastoral care   kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people  the pursuit of wisdom  he assured his readers of the boethius  was the surest path to power   study wisdom  then  and  when you have learned it  condemn it not  for i tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power  yea  even though not desiring it  

the portrayal of the west saxon resistance to the vikings by asser and the chronicler as a christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda  it reflected alfred s own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical christian world order in which god is the lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers  the need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the  common good  led alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as offa as well as clerical writers such as bede  alcuin and the other luminaries of the carolingian renaissance  this was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in alfred s worldview  he believed  as did other kings in ninth century england and francia  that god had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people  if the christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom  if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies  if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference  he was answerable before god  as josiah had been  alfred s ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people 

asser wrote of alfred in his  life of king alfred  
it is also written by asser that alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later  which is described as  shameful negligence  of his parents and tutors  alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well  a story is told by asser about how his mother held up a book of saxon poetry to him and his brothers  and said   i shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest   after excitedly asking   will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you   alfred then took it to his teacher  learned it  and recited it back to his mother 

alfred is also noted as carrying around a small book  probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook  which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected  asser writes  these  he collected in a single book  as i have seen for myself  amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer  and was inseparable from it  

an excellent hunter in every branch of the sport  alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody s skills could compare 

although he was the youngest of his brothers  he was probably the most open minded  he was an early advocate for education  his desire for learning could have come from his early love of english poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life  asser writes that alfred  could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most  namely the liberal arts  for  as he used to say  there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the west saxons at that time  

in      alfred married ealhswith  daughter of a mercian nobleman    thelred mucel  ealdorman of the gaini  the gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the mercians  ealhswith s mother  eadburh  was a member of the mercian royal family 

they had five or six children together including  edward the elder who succeeded his father as king    thelfl  d who became lady  ruler  of the mercians in her own right  and   lfthryth who married baldwin ii the count of flanders  his mother was osburga  daughter of oslac of the isle of wight  chief butler of england  asser  in his  vita   lfredi  asserts that this shows his lineage from the jutes of the isle of wight  this is unlikely as bede tells us that they were all slaughtered by the saxons under c  dwalla  in       the skeleton of queen eadgyth  granddaughter of alfred the great was found in magdeburg cathedral in germany  it was confirmed in      that these remains belong to her   one of the earliest members of the english royal family 

osferth was described as a relative in king alfred s will and he attested charters in a high position until      a charter of king edward s reign described him as the king s brother     mistakenly according to keynes and lapidge  and in the view of janet nelson he probably was an illegitimate son of king alfred 

alfred died on    october     at the age of    or     how he died is unknown  although he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness  his biographer asser gave a detailed description of alfred s symptoms and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis  it is thought that he had either crohn s disease or haemorrhoidal disease  his grandson king eadred seems to have suffered from a similar illness 

alfred was buried temporarily in the old minster in winchester  four years after his death  he was moved to the new minster  perhaps built especially to receive his body   the new minster moved to hyde in      a little north of the city  and the monks were transferred to hyde abbey along with alfred s body and those of his wife and children  which were presumably interred before the high altar  the abbey was dissolved in      during the reign of henry viii and the church was demolished  leaving the graves intact 

the royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in      when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site  prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution  coffins were stripped of lead  and bones were scattered and lost  the prison was demolished between      and       further excavations were inconclusive in      and       in       amateur antiquarian john mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of alfred  these came into the possession of the vicar of nearby st bartholomew s church who reburied them in an unmarked grave in the church graveyard 

excavations conducted by the winchester museums service of the hyde abbey site in      located a second pit dug in front of where the high altar would have been located  which was identified as probably dating to mellor s      excavation  the      archeological excavation uncovered the foundations of the abbey buildings and some bones  suggested at the time to be those of alfred  they proved instead to belong to an elderly woman  in march       the diocese of winchester exhumed the bones from the unmarked grave at st bartholomew s and placed them in secure storage  the diocese made no claim that they were the bones of alfred  but intended to secure them for later analysis  and from the attentions of people whose interest may have been sparked by the recent identification of the remains of king richard iii  the bones were radiocarbon dated but the results showed that they were from the     s and therefore not of alfred 

in january       a fragment of pelvis was radiocarbon dated to the correct period  it was unearthed in the      excavation of the hyde site and had subsequently lain in a winchester museum store room  it has been suggested that this bone may belong to either alfred or his son edward  but this remains unproven 

alfred is venerated as a saint by some christian traditions  henry vi of england attempted unsuccessfully to have him canonized by the pope in       but he is venerated in the catholic church  the anglican communion venerates him as a christian hero  with a feast day or commemoration on    october  and he may often be found depicted in stained glass in church of england parish churches 

alfred commissioned bishop asser to write his biography  which inevitably emphasised alfred s positive aspects  later medieval historians such as geoffrey of monmouth also reinforced alfred s favourable image  by the time of the reformation  alfred was seen as a pious christian ruler who promoted the use of english rather than latin  and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later roman catholic influences of the normans  consequently  it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave alfred his epithet as  the great   not any of alfred s contemporaries  the epithet was retained by succeeding generations who admired alfred s patriotism  success against barbarism  promotion of education  and establishment of the rule of law 

a number of educational establishments are named in alfred s honour 


the royal navy has named one ship and two shore establishments hms  king alfred   and one of the first ships of the us navy was named uss  alfred  in his honour  in       alfred was ranked number    in the bbc s list of the     greatest britons following a uk wide vote

alessandro algardi

alessandro algardi  november              june           was an italian high baroque sculptor active almost exclusively in rome  where for the latter decades of his life  he was  along with francesco borromini and pietro da cortona  one of the major rivals of gian lorenzo bernini 

algardi was born in bologna  where at a young age  he was apprenticed in the studio of agostino carracci  however  his aptitude for sculpture led him to work for giulio cesare conventi                an artist of modest talents  his two earliest known works date back to this period  two statues of saints  made of chalk  in the oratory of santa maria della vita in bologna  by the age of twenty  ferdinando i  duke of mantua  began commissioning works from him  and he was also employed by local jewelers for figurative designs  after a short residence in venice  he went to rome in      with an introduction from the duke of mantua to the late pope s nephew  cardinal ludovico ludovisi  who employed him for a time in the restoration of ancient statues 

propelled by the borghese and barberini patronage  gian lorenzo bernini and his studio garnered most of the major roman sculptural commissions  for nearly a decade  algardi struggled for recognition  in rome he was aided by friends that included pietro da cortona and his fellow bolognese  domenichino  his early roman commissions included terracotta and some marble portrait busts  while he supported himself with small works like crucifixes  in the     s he worked on the tombs of the mellini family in the mellini chapel in santa maria del popolo 
algardi s first major commission came about in       when cardinal ubaldini  medici  contracted for a funeral monument for his great uncle  pope leo xi  the third of the medici popes  who had reigned for less than a month in       the monument was started in       and mostly completed by       the arrangement mirrors the one designed by bernini for the tomb of urban viii              with a central hieratic sculpture of the pope seated in full regalia and offering a hand of blessing  while at his feet  two allegorical female figures flank his sarcophagus  however  in bernini s tomb  the vigorous upraised arm and posture of the pope is counterbalanced by an active drama below  wherein the figures of  charity  and  justice  are either distracted by  putti  or lost in contemplation  while skeletal  death  actively writes the epitaph  algardi s tomb is much less dynamic  the allegorical figures of  magnanimity  and  liberality  have an impassive  ethereal dignity  some have identified the helmeted figure of  magnanimity  with that of athena and iconic images of  wisdom    liberality  resembles duquesnoy s famous  santa susanna   but rendered more elegant  the tomb is somberly monotone and lacks the polychromatic excitement that detracts from the elegiac mood of urban viii s tomb 

in            pietro boncompagni commissioned from algardi a colossal statue of philip neri with kneeling angels for santa maria in vallicella  completed in       immediately after this  algardi produced an interactive sculptural group representing the beheading of saint paul with two figures  a kneeling  resigned saint and the executioner poised to strike the sword blow  for the church of san paolo  bologna  these works established his reputation  like bernini s characteristic works  they often express the baroque aesthetic of depicting dramatic attitudes and emotional expressions  yet algardi s sculpture has a restraining sobriety in contrast to those of his rival 

with the death of the barberini pope urban viii in      and the accession of the pamphilj pope innocent x  the barberini family and fell into disrepute  resulting in fewer commissions for bernini  algardi  on the other hand  was embraced by the new pope and the pope s nephew  camillo pamphilj  algardi s portraits were highly prized  and their formal severity contrasts with bernini s more vivacious expression  a large hieratic bronze of innocent x by algardi is now to be found in the capitoline museums 

algardi was not renowned for his architectural abilities  although he was in charge of the project for the papal villa  the villa pamphili  now villa doria pamphili  outside the porta san pancrazio in rome  he may have had professional guidance on the design of the casino from the architect engineer girolamo rainaldi and help with supervising its construction from his assistant giovanni francesco grimaldi  the casino was a showcase for the pamphili collection of sculpture  ancient and contemporary  on which algardi was well able to advise  in the villa grounds  algardi and his studio executed sculpture encrusted fountains and other garden features  where some of his free standing sculpture and bas reliefs remain 

in      algardi met diego vel  zquez  who obtained commissions for his work from spain  as a consequence there are four chimney pieces by algardi in the royal palace of aranjuez  and in the gardens  the figures on the fountain of neptune are also by him  the augustinian monastery at salamanca contains the tomb of the count and countess de monterey  another work by algardi 

algardi s large dramatic marble high relief panel of pope leo and attila            for st peter s basilica  and reinvigorated the use of such marble reliefs  there had been large marble reliefs used previously in roman churches  but for most patrons  sculpted marble altarpieces were far too costly  in this relief  the two principal figures  the stern and courageous pope and the dismayed and frightened attila  surge forward from the center into three dimensions  only they two see the descending angelic warriors rallying to the pope s defense  while all others in the background reliefs  persist in performing their respective earthly duties 

the subject was apt for a papal state seeking clout  since it depicts the historical legend when the greatest of the popes leo  with supernatural aid  deterred the huns from looting rome  from a baroque standpoint it is a moment of divine intervention in the affairs of man  no doubt part of his patron s message would be that all viewers would be sternly reminded of the papal capacity to invoke divine retribution against enemies 

algardi died in rome within a year of completing his famous relief  which was admired by contemporaries 

in his later years algardi controlled a large studio and amassed a great fortune  algardi s classicizing manner was carried on by pupils  including ercole ferrata and domenico guidi   antonio raggi initially trained with him  the latter two completed his design for an altarpiece of the  vision of saint nicholas   san nicola da tolentino  rome  using two separate marble pieces linked together in one event and place  yet successfully separating the divine and earthly spheres  other lesser known assistants from his studio include francesco barrata  girolamo lucenti  and giuseppe peroni 

algardi was also known for his portraiture which shows an obsessive attention to details of psychologically revealing physiognomy in a sober but immediate naturalism  and minute attention to costume and draperies  such as in the busts of laudivio zacchia  camillo pamphilj  and of muzio frangipane and his two sons lello and roberto 

in temperament  his style was more akin to the classicized and restrained baroque of duquesnoy than to the emotive works of other baroque artists  from an artistic point of view  he was most successful in portrait statues and groups of children  where he was obliged to follow nature most closely  his terracotta models  some of them finished works of art  were prized by collectors  an outstanding series of terracotta models is at the hermitage museum  saint petersburg

algiers

algiers     al jaz     er     is the capital and largest city of algeria  in       the city s population was estimated to be around            an estimate puts the population of the larger metropolitan city to be around            algiers is located on the mediterranean sea and in the north central portion of algeria 

algiers is situated on the west side of a bay of the mediterranean sea  the modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore  the old part  the ancient city of the deys  climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the casbah or citadel  above the sea  the casbah and the two quays form a triangle 

the city s name is derived via french and catalan  alger  from the arabic name  al jaz     ir       the islands   this name refers to the four former islands which lay off the city s coast before becoming part of the mainland in        al jaz     ir  is itself a truncated form of the city s older name  jaza ir bani mazghana       the islands of the sons of mazghana   used by early medieval geographers such as al idrisi and yaqut al hamawi 

in antiquity  the greeks knew the town as  ikosion      which was latinized as icosium under roman rule  the greeks explained the name as coming from their word for  twenty      eikosi    supposedly because it had been founded by    companions of hercules when he visited the atlas mountains during his labors  in fact  the name transcribed the punic name    seagull island   again named after the site s former islands 

algiers is also known as el behdja     the white   or  algiers the white     for its whitewashed buildings  seen rising from the sea 

a small phoenician colony on algiers s former islands was established and taken over by the carthaginians sometime before the  rd century  after the punic wars  the romans eventually took over administration of the town  which they called icosium  its ruins now form part of the modern city s marine quarter  with the rue de la marine following a former roman road  roman cemeteries existed near  bab el oued  and  bab azoun   the city was given latin rights by the emperor vespasian  the bishops of icosium are mentioned as late as the  th century  but the ancient town fell into obscurity during the muslim conquest of north africa 

the present city was founded in     by bologhine ibn ziri  the founder of the berber zirid   sanhaja dynasty  he had earlier       built his own house and a sanhaja center at ashir  just south of algiers  although his zirid dynasty was overthrown by roger ii of sicily in       the zirids had already lost control of algiers to their cousins the hammadids in       the city was wrested from the hammadids by the almohads in       and in the   th century came under the dominion of the ziyanid sultans of tlemcen  nominally part of the sultanate of tlemcen  algiers had a large measure of independence under amirs of its own due to oran being the chief seaport of the ziyanids 

the pe    n of algiers  an islet in front of algiers harbour had been occupied by the spaniards as early as       thereafter  a considerable amount of trade began to flow between algiers and spain  however  algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the moors from spain  many of whom sought asylum in the city  in       following their occupation of oran and other towns on the coast of africa  the spaniards fortified the islet of pe  on and imposed a levy intended to suppress corsair activity 

in       the amir of algiers  selim b  teumi  invited the corsair brothers aruj and hayreddin  barbarossa  to expel the spaniards  aruj came to algiers  ordered the assassination of selim  and seized the town and ousted the spanish in the capture of algiers         hayreddin  succeeding aruj after the latter was killed in battle against the spaniards in the fall of tlemcen         was the founder of the  pashaluk   which subsequently became the  beylik   of algeria  barbarossa lost algiers in      but regained it with the capture of algiers         and then formally invited the sultan suleiman the magnificent to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex algiers to the ottoman empire 

algiers from this time became the chief seat of the barbary pirates  in october      in the algiers expedition  the king of spain and holy roman emperor charles v sought to capture the city  but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships  and his army of some         chiefly made up of spaniards  was defeated by the algerians under their pasha  hassan 

formally part of the ottoman empire but essentially free from ottoman control  starting in the   th century algiers turned to piracy and ransoming  due to its location on the periphery of both the ottoman and european economic spheres  and depending for its existence on a mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by european shipping  backed by european navies  piracy became the primary economic activity  repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as iceland  the united states fought two wars  the first and second barbary wars  over algiers  attacks on shipping 

among the notable people held for ransom was the future spanish novelist miguel de cervantes  who was captive in algiers almost five years  and who wrote two plays set in algiers of the period  the primary source for knowledge of algiers of this period  since there are no contemporary local sources  is the  topograf  a e historia general de argel         but written earlier   published by diego de haedo  but whose authorship is disputed  this work describes in detail the city  the behavior of its inhabitants  and its military defenses  with the unsuccessful hope of facilitating an attack by spain so as to end the piracy 

a significant number of renegades lived in algiers at the time  christians converted voluntarily to islam  many fleeing the law or other problems at home  once converted to islam  they were safe in algiers  many occupied positions of authority  such as samson rowlie  an englishman who became treasurer of algiers 

the city under ottoman control was enclosed by a wall on all sides  including along the seafront  in this wall  five gates allowed access to the city  with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the ketchaoua mosque  in       a citadel was constructed at the highest point in the wall  a major road running north to south divided the city in two  the upper city  al gabal  or  the mountain   which consisted of about fifty small quarters of andalusian  jewish  moorish and kabyle communities  and the lower city  al wata  or  the plains   which was the administrative  military and commercial centre of the city  mostly inhabited by turkish dignitaries and other upper class families 

in august       the city was bombarded by a british squadron under lord exmouth  a descendant of thomas pellew  taken in an algerian slave raid in        assisted by dutch men of war  destroying the corsair fleet harboured in algiers 

the history of algiers from      to      is bound to the larger history of algeria and its relationship to france  on july          under the pretext of an affront to the french consul   whom the dey had hit with a fly whisk when the consul said the french government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two algerian merchants   a french army under general de bourmont attacked the city in the      invasion of algiers  the city capitulated the following day  algiers became the capital of french algeria 

many europeans settled in algiers  and by the early   th century they formed a majority of the city s population  during the     s  the architect le corbusier drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city  le corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of algiers  describing the european district as  nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature  the whole a sullied blot   he also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the european and african residents of the city  describing a situation in which  the  civilised  live like rats in holes  whereas  the  barbarians  live in solitude  in well being   however  these plans were ultimately ignored by the french administration 

during world war ii  algiers was the first city to be seized from the germans by the allies during operation torch 
in       after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands  estimates range between         and            died  mostly algerians but also french and pieds noirs  during fighting between the french army and the algerian front de lib  ration nationale  algeria gained its independence  with algiers as its capital  since then  despite losing its entire  pied noir  population  the city has expanded massively  it now has about five million inhabitants  or    percent of algeria s population   and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding mitidja plain 

algiers also played a pivotal role in the algerian war                particularly during the battle of algiers when the   th parachute division of the french army  starting on january          and on the orders of the french minister of justice fran  ois mitterrand  who authorized any means  to eliminate the insurrectionists    led attacks against the algerian fighters for independence  algiers remains marked by this battle  which was characterized by merciless fighting between fln forces which carried out a guerrilla campaign against the french military and police and pro french algerian soldiers  and the french army which responded with a bloody repression  torture and blanket terrorism against the native population  the demonstrations of may    during the crisis of      provoked the fall of the fourth republic in france  as well as the return of general de gaulle to power 

algeria achieved independence on july          run by the fln that had secured independence  algiers became a member of non aligned movement during the cold war  in october       one year before the fall of the berlin wall  algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single party system and the creation of a  real  democracy baptized the  spring of algier   the demonstrators were repressed by the authorities  more than     dead   but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern algeria  in       a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the one party rule and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties  as well as official freedom of the press 

the city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until       in       a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the islamic salvation front engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities  in the      elections for the algerian national assembly  the islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round  helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned algerian voters by the turn of events  fearing an eventual win by the islamists  the army canceled the election process  setting off a civil war between the state and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade 

on december           two car bombs exploded in algiers  one bomb targeted two united nations buildings and the other targeted a government building housing the supreme court  the death toll was at least     with over two hundred injured in the attacks  however  only    remained hospitalized the following day    it is speculated that the attack was carried out by the al qaida cell within the city 

indigenous terrorist groups have been actively operating in algeria since around      

algiers has a mediterranean climate  k  ppen climate classification  csa    its proximity to the mediterranean sea aids in moderating the city s temperatures  as a result  algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior deserts  algiers on average receives roughly of rain per year  the bulk of which is seen between october and april  the precipitation is very similar to coastal mediterranean spain as opposed to the interior north african arid climate 

snow is very rare  in       the city received   its first snowfall in eight years 

there are many public buildings of interest  including the whole kasbah quarter  martyrs square   sahat ech chouhada                            the government offices  formerly the british consulate   the  grand    new   and ketchaoua mosques  the roman catholic cathedral of notre dame d afrique  the bardo museum  a former turkish mansion   the old  biblioth  que nationale d alger    a turkish palace built in               and the new national library  built in a style reminiscent of the british library 

the main building in the kasbah was begun in      on the site of an older building  and served as the palace of the deys until the french conquest  a road has been cut through the centre of the building  the mosque turned into barracks  and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin  there still remain a minaret and some marble arches and columns  traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey 

the great mosque   jamaa el kebir                             is the oldest mosque in algiers  it was first built by yusuf ibn tashfin  but reconstructed many times  the pulpit   minbar            bears an inscription showing that the building existed in       the minaret was built by the sultan of tlemcen  in       the interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by moorish arches 

the new mosque   jamaa el jedid                              dating from the   th century  is in the form of a greek cross  surmounted by a large white cupola  with four small cupolas at the corners  the minaret is high  the interior resembles that of the grand mosque 

the church of the holy trinity  built in       stands at the southern end of the  rue d isly  near the site of the demolished fort bab azoun                  the interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles  many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the british residents  voluntary and involuntary  of algiers from the time of john tipton  the first english consul  in       nb some sources give        one tablet records that in      two algerine pirate crews landed in ireland  sacked baltimore  and enslaved its inhabitants 

the ketchaoua mosque   djamaa ketchaoua                          at the foot of the casbah  was before independence in      the cathedral of st philippe  itself made in      from a mosque dating from       the principal entrance  reached by a flight of    steps  is ornamented with a portico supported by four black veined marble columns  the roof of the nave is of moorish plaster work  it rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns  several of these columns belonged to the original mosque  in one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of san geronimo  the building seems a curious blend of moorish and byzantine styles

ibn al haytham

hasan ibn al haytham  latinized alhazen   full name        was an arab mathematician  astronomer  and physicist of the islamic golden age  sometimes called  the father of modern optics   he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception in particular  his most influential work being his  kit  b al man     ir                             book of optics    written during              which survived in the latin edition  a polymath  he also wrote on philosophy  theology and medicine 

ibn al haytham was the first to explain that vision occurs when light bounces on an object and then is directed to one s eyes  and he was the first to point out that vision occurs in the brain  rather than in the eyes  he was also an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be proved by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidence   hence understanding the scientific method five centuries before renaissance scientists 

born in basra  he spent most of his productive period in the fatimid capital of cairo and earned his living authoring various treatises and tutoring members of the nobilities  ibn al haytham is sometimes given the byname  al ba   r    after his birthplace  or  al mi   r      of egypt    ibn al haytham was nicknamed the  second ptolemy  by abu l hasan bayhaqi  and the  the physicist  by john peckham  ibn al haytham paved the way for the modern science of physical optics 

ibn al haytham  alhazen  was born c      to an arab family in basra  iraq  
which was at the time part of the buyid emirate  
he held a position with the title  vizier  in his native basra  and made a name for himself for his knowledge of applied mathematics  
as he claimed to be able to regulate the flooding of the nile  he was invited to by fatimid caliph al hakim in order to realise a hydraulic project at aswan  however  ibn al haytham was forced to concede the impracticability of his project 
upon his return to cairo  he was given an administrative post  after he proved unable to fulfill this task as well  he contracted the ire of the caliph al hakim bi amr allah  and is said to have been forced into hiding until the caliph s death in       after which his confiscated possessions were returned to him 
legend has it that alhazen feigned madness and was kept under house arrest during this period  during this time  he wrote his influential  book of optics  
alhazen continued to live in cairo  in the neighborhood of the famous university of al azhar  and lived from the proceeds of his literary production until his death in c         a copy of apollonius   conics   written in ibn al haytham s own handwriting exists in aya sofya   ms aya sofya           fob   dated safar     a h           

among his students were sorkhab  sohrab   a persian from semnan  and abu al wafa mubashir ibn fatek  an egyptian prince 

alhazen s most famous work is his seven volume treatise on optics  kitab al manazir    book of optics    written from      to      

 optics  was translated into latin by an unknown scholar at the end of the   th century or the beginning of the   th century  it was printed by friedrich risner in       with the title  opticae thesaurus  alhazeni arabis libri septem  nuncprimum editi  eiusdem liber de crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus   english   thesaurus of optics  seven books of the arab alhazeni  first edition  concerning twilight and the advancement of clouds   risner is also the author of the name variant  alhazen   before risner he was known in the west as alhacen  this work enjoyed a great reputation during the middle ages  works by alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the biblioth  que nationale in paris in      by e  a  sedillot  in all  a  mark smith has accounted for    full or near complete manuscripts  and five fragments  which are preserved in    locations  including one in the bodleian library at oxford  and one in the library of bruges 

two major theories on vision prevailed in classical antiquity  the first theory  the emission theory  was supported by such thinkers as euclid and ptolemy  who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting rays of light  the second theory  the intromission theory supported by aristotle and his followers  had physical forms entering the eye from an object  previous islamic writers  such as al kindi  had argued essentially on euclidean  galenist  or aristotelian lines  the strongest influence on the  book of optics  was from ptolemy s  optics   while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on galen s account  alhazen s achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of euclid  the medical tradition of galen  and the intromission theories of aristotle  alhazen s intromission theory followed al kindi  and broke with aristotle  in asserting that  from each point of every colored body  illuminated by any light  issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point   this however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation  in particular  every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye  what alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye  he attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object   for any one point on the eye only saw the ray that reached it directly  without being refracted by any other part of the eye  would be perceived  he argued using a physical analogy that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays  in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board  whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off  perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays  and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye  as there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point  and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone  this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye  if only the perpendicular ray mattered  then he had a one to one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved  he later asserted  in book seven of the  optics   that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived  as if  perpendicular 

his arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why  only  perpendicular rays were perceived  why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly  his later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive  however  despite its weaknesses  no other theory of the time was so comprehensive  and it was enormously influential  particularly in western europe  directly or indirectly  his  de aspectibus   book of optics  inspired much activity in optics between the   th and   th centuries  kepler s later theory of the retinal image  which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye  built directly on the conceptual framework of alhazen 

alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines  and carried out various experiments with lenses  mirrors  refraction  and reflection  his analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately 

the camera obscura was known to the ancient chinese  and was described by the han chinese polymathic genius shen kuo in his scientific book  dream pool essays   published in the year      c e   aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his  problems   however alhazen s work also contained the first clear description  outside of china  of camera obscura in the areas of the middle east  europe  africa and india  and early analysis of the device 

alhazen studied the process of sight  the structure of the eye  image formation in the eye  and the visual system  ian p  howard argued in a       perception  article that alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to western europeans writing centuries later  for example  he described what became in the   th century hering s law of equal innervation  he wrote a description of vertical horopters     years before aguilonius that is actually closer to the modern definition than aguilonius s   and his work on binocular disparity was repeated by panum in       craig aaen stockdale  while agreeing that alhazen should be credited with many advances  has expressed some caution  especially when considering alhazen in isolation from ptolemy  with whom alhazen was extremely familiar  alhazen corrected a significant error of ptolemy regarding binocular vision  but otherwise his account is very similar  ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called hering s law  in general  alhazen built on and expanded the optics of ptolemy  in a more detailed account of ibn al haytham s contribution to the study of binocular vision based on lejeune and sabra  raynaud showed that the concepts of correspondence  homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in ibn al haytham s optics  but contrary to howard  he explained why ibn al haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why  by reasoning experimentally  he was in fact closer to the discovery of panum s fusional area than that of the vieth m  ller circle  in this regard  ibn al haytham s theory of binocular vision faced two main limits  the lack of recognition of the role of the retina  and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts 
alhazen s most original contribution was that after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed  he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system  his understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye  which he sought to avoid  he maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens  or glacial humor as he called it  were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye  he followed galen in believing that the lens was the receptive organ of sight  although some of his work hints that he thought the retina was also involved 

alhazen s synthesis of light and vision adhered to the aristotelian scheme  exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical  complete fashion 

an aspect associated with alhazen s optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation   i tibar   arabic                and controlled testing in his scientific inquiries  moreover  his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics   ilm tabi i   with mathematics   ta alim   geometry in particular   this mathematical physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in  kitab al manazir    the optics    de aspectibus  or  perspectivae   and grounded his theories of vision  light and colour  as well as his research in catoptrics and dioptrics  the study of the reflection and refraction of light  respectively   

according to matthias schramm  alhazen  was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner  in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light spot formed by the projection of the moonlight through two small apertures onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up   g  j  toomer expressed some skepticism regarding schramm s view  arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in alhazen s very large body of work  because at the time         his  book of optics  had not yet been fully translated from arabic  while acknowledging alhazen s importance in developing experimental techniques  toomer argued that alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other islamic and ancient thinkers  toomer does concede that  schramm sums up  alhazen s  achievement in the development of scientific method   toomer      lists  as a precondition  what is needed for historians to investigate schramm s claim        that ibn al haytham was the true founder of modern physics  is translations of ibn al haytham 

mark smith recounts alhazen s elaboration of ptolemy s experiments in double vision  reflection  and refraction  alhazen s  optics  book influenced the perspectivists in europe  roger bacon  witelo  and peckham   the optics  was incorporated into risner s      printing of  opticae thesaurus   through which kepler finally resolved the contradictions inherent in witelo s explanation of the imaging chain  from external object to the retina of the eye 

his work on catoptrics in book v of the book of optics contains a discussion of what is now known as alhazen s problem  first formulated by ptolemy in     ad  it comprises drawing lines from two points in the plane of a circle meeting at a point on the circumference and making equal angles with the normal at that point  this is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular billiard table at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point  thus  its main application in optics is to solve the problem   given a light source and a spherical mirror  find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer   this leads to an equation of the fourth degree  this eventually led alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of fourth powers  where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated  his method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers  although he did not himself do this  perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in   he used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an integration  where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a paraboloid  alhazen eventually solved the problem using conic sections and a geometric proof  his solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in latin translation  later mathematicians used descartes  analytical methods to analyse the problem  with a new solution being found in      by the oxford mathematician peter m  neumann  recently  mitsubishi electric research laboratories  merl  researchers amit agrawal  yuichi taguchi and srikumar ramalingam solved the extension of alhazen s problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic  parabolic and elliptical mirrors  they showed that the mirror reflection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case  if the camera  eye  is placed on the axis of the mirror  the degree of the equation reduces to six  alhazen s problem can also be extended to multiple refractions from a spherical ball  given a light source and a spherical ball of certain refractive index  the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is refracted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation 

 the kitab al manazir  book of optics  describes several experimental observations that alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies  he conducted experiments with projectiles and concluded that only the impact of perpendicular projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate  whereas surfaces tended to deflect oblique projectile strikes  for example  to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium  he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet  a perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through  whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not  he also used this result to explain how intense  direct light hurts the eye  using a mechanical analogy  alhazen associated  strong  lights with perpendicular rays and  weak  lights with oblique ones  the obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray  since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye 

sudanese psychologist omar khaleefa has argued that alhazen should be considered the founder of experimental psychology  for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and optical illusions  khaleefa has also argued that alhazen should also be considered the  founder of psychophysics   a sub discipline and precursor to modern psychology  although alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision  there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed 

alhazen offered an explanation of the moon illusion  an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval europe  many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky  alhazen argued against ptolemy s refraction theory  and defined the problem in terms of perceived  rather than real  enlargement  he said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer  when the moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects  so the moon appears close  the perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance  therefore  the moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky  and further and larger on the horizon  through works by roger bacon  john pecham and witelo based on alhazen s explanation  the moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon  with the refraction theory being rejected in the   th century  although alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation  he was not the first author to offer it  cleomedes    nd century  gave this account  in addition to refraction   and he credited it to posidonius          bc   ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his  optics   but the text is obscure  alhazen s writings were more widely available in the middle ages than those of these earlier authors  and that probably explains why alhazen received the credit 

besides the  book of optics   alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject  including his  risala fi l daw       treatise on light    he investigated the properties of luminance  the rainbow  eclipses  twilight  and moonlight  experiments with mirrors and the refractive interfaces between air  water  and glass cubes  hemispheres  and quarter spheres provided the foundation for his theories on catoptrics 

alhazen discussed the physics of the celestial region in his  epitome of astronomy   arguing that ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses   in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where  for example  none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other  the suggestion of mechanical models for the earth centred ptolemaic model  greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the ptolemaic system among the christians of the west   alhazen s determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important  however  because it meant astronomical hypotheses  were accountable to the laws of physics   and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms 

he also wrote  maqala fi daw al qamar    on the light of the moon   

in his work  alhazen discussed theories on the motion of a body  in his  treatise on place   alhazen disagreed with aristotle s view that nature abhors a void  and he used geometry in an attempt to demonstrate that place   al makan   is the imagined three dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body 

in his  on the configuration of the world  alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth 

the book is a non technical explanation of ptolemy s almagest  which was eventually translated into hebrew and latin in the   th and   th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as georg von peuerbach during the european middle ages and renaissance 

in his  al shuk  k    al   batlamy  s   variously translated as  doubts concerning ptolemy  or  aporias against ptolemy   published at some time between      and       alhazen criticized ptolemy s  almagest    planetary hypotheses   and  optics   pointing out various contradictions he found in these works  particularly in astronomy  ptolemy s  almagest  concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets  whereas the  hypotheses  concerned what ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets  ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other  arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error  but alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in ptolemy s works  he considered that some of the mathematical devices ptolemy introduced into astronomy  especially the equant  failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion  and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points  lines and circles 

having pointed out the problems  alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in ptolemy in a later work  alhazen believed there was a  true configuration  of the planets that ptolemy had failed to grasp  he intended to complete and repair ptolemy s system  not to replace it completely  in the  doubts concerning ptolemy  alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories 

he held that the criticism of existing theories   which dominated this book   holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge 

alhazen s  the model of the motions of each of the seven planets  was written       only one damaged manuscript has been found  with only the introduction and the first section  on the theory of planetary motion  surviving   there was also a second section on astronomical calculation  and a third section  on astronomical instruments   following on from his  doubts on ptolemy   alhazen described a new  geometry based planetary model  describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry  infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry  he kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular  which required the inclusion of epicycles to explain observed motion  but he managed to eliminate ptolemy s equant  in general  his model didn t try to provide a causal explanation of the motions  but concentrated on providing a complete  geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in ptolemy s model 

alhazen wrote a total of twenty five astronomical works  some concerning technical issues such as  exact determination of the meridian   a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation  a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the milky way  alhazen argued for a distant location  based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars  the fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory  including the  doubts  and  model of the motions  discussed above 

in mathematics  alhazen built on the mathematical works of euclid and thabit ibn qurra and worked on  the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry  

he developed a formula for summing the first     natural numbers  using a geometric proof to prove the formula 

alhazen explored what is now known as the euclidean parallel postulate  the fifth postulate in euclid s  elements   using a proof by contradiction  and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry  he formulated the lambert quadrilateral  which boris abramovich rozenfeld names the  ibn al haytham   lambert quadrilateral  

in elementary geometry  alhazen attempted to solve the problem of squaring the circle using the area of lunes  crescent shapes   but later gave up on the impossible task  the two lunes formed from a right triangle by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangle s sides  inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides  are known as the lunes of alhazen  they have the same total area as the triangle itself 

alhazen s contributions to number theory include his work on perfect numbers  in his  analysis and synthesis   he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form              where           is prime  but he was not able to prove this result  euler later proved it in the   th century 

alhazen solved problems involving congruences using what is now called wilson s theorem  in his  opuscula   alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences  and gives two general methods of solution  his first method  the canonical method  involved wilson s theorem  while his second method involved a version of the chinese remainder theorem 

alhazen discovered the sum formula for the fourth power  using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power  he used this to find the volume of a paraboloid  he could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula 

alhazen also wrote a  treatise on the influence of melodies on the souls of animals   although no copies have survived  it appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music  for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace 

in engineering  one account of his career as a civil engineer has him summoned to egypt by the fatimid caliph  al hakim bi amr allah  to regulate the flooding of the nile river  he carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual inundation of the nile river  and he drew plans for building a dam  at the site of the modern day aswan dam  his field work  however  later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme  and he soon feigned madness so he could avoid punishment from the caliph 

in his  treatise on place   alhazen disagreed with aristotle s view that nature abhors a void  and he used geometry in an attempt to demonstrate that place   al makan   is the imagined three dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body  abd el latif  a supporter of aristotle s philosophical view of place  later criticized the work in  fi al radd    ala ibn al haytham fi al makan    a refutation of ibn al haytham   s place   for its geometrization of place 

alhazen also discussed space perception and its epistemological implications in his  book of optics   in  tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience  alhazen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and  therefore  the autonomy of vision  without tangible notions of distance and size for
correlation  sight can tell us next to nothing about such things  

alhazen was a muslim  it is not certain to which school of islam he belonged  as a sunni  he may have been either a follower of the ash ari school  or a follower of the mu tazili school 
sabra        even suggested he might have been an adherent of shia islam 

alhazen wrote a work on islamic theology in which he discussed prophethood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time  
he also wrote a treatise entitled  finding the direction of qibla by calculation  in which he discussed finding the qibla  where prayers  salat  are directed towards  mathematically 

there are occasional references to theology or religious sentiment in his technical works  e g  
in  doubts concerning ptolemy  

in  the winding motion  
regarding the relation of objective truth and god 

alhazen made significant contributions to optics  number theory  geometry  astronomy and natural philosophy  alhazen s work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment 

his main work   kitab al manazir    book of optics    was known in the muslim world mainly  but not exclusively  through the thirteenth century commentary by kam  l al d  n al f  ris    the  tanq       al man     ir  li dhaw   l ab     r wa l ba      ir   in al andalus  it was used by the eleventh century prince of the banu hud dynasty of zaragossa and author of an important mathematical text  al mu taman ibn h  d  a latin translation of the  kitab al manazir  was made probably in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century  this translation was read by and greatly influenced a number of scholars in christian europe including  roger bacon  robert grosseteste  witelo  giambattista della porta  leonardo da vinci  galileo galilei  christiaan huygens  ren   descartes  and johannes kepler  his research in catoptrics  the study of optical systems using mirrors  centred on spherical and parabolic mirrors and spherical aberration  he made the observation that the ratio between the angle of incidence and refraction does not remain constant  and investigated the magnifying power of a lens  his work on catoptrics also contains the problem known as  alhazen s problem   meanwhile in the islamic world  alhazen s work influenced averroes  writings on optics  and his legacy was further advanced through the  reforming  of his  optics  by persian scientist kamal al din al farisi  died ca        in the latter s  kitab tanqih al manazir    the revision of   ibn al haytham s   optics    alhazen wrote as many as     books  although only    have survived  some of his treatises on optics survived only through latin translation  during the middle ages his books on cosmology were translated into latin  hebrew and other languages 

the impact crater alhazen on the moon is named in his honour  as was the asteroid       alhazen  in honour of alhazen  the aga khan university  pakistan  named its ophthalmology endowed chair as  the ibn e haitham associate professor and chief of ophthalmology   alhazen  by the name ibn al haytham  is featured on the obverse of the iraqi        dinar banknote issued in       and on    dinar notes from      

the      international year of light celebrated the     th anniversary of the works on optics by ibn al haytham 

in       the  hiding in the light  episode of     presented by neil degrasse tyson  focused on the accomplishments of ibn al haytham  he was voiced by alfred molina in the episode 

over forty years previously  jacob bronowski presented alhazen s work in a similar television documentary  and the corresponding book    the ascent of man   in episode     the music of the spheres    bronowski remarked that in his view  alhazen was  the one really original scientific mind that arab culture produced   whose theory of optics was not improved on till the time of newton and leibniz 

h  j  j  winter  a british historian of science  summing up the importance of ibn al haytham in the history of physics wrote 
after the death of archimedes no really great physicist appeared until ibn al haytham  if  therefore  we confine our interest only to the history of physics  there is a long period of over twelve hundred years during which the golden age of greece gave way to the era of muslim scholasticism  and the experimental spirit of the noblest physicist of antiquity lived again in the arab scholar from basra 

unesco declared      the international year of light and its director general irina bokova dubbed ibn al haytham  the father of optics   amongst others  this was to celebrate ibn al haytham s achievements in optics  mathematics and astronomy  an international campaign  created by the      inventions organisation  titled       inventions and the world of ibn al haytham  featuring a series of interactive exhibits  workshops and live shows about his work  partnering with science centers  science festivals  museums  and educational institutions  as well as digital and social media platforms  the campaign also produced and released the short educational film      inventions and the world of ibn al haytham 

 has noted that alhazen s treatment of refraction describes an experimental setup without publication of data  ptolemy published his experimental results for refraction  in contrast 

according to medieval biographers  alhazen wrote more than     works on a wide range of subjects  of which at least    of his scientific works are known  most of his works are now lost  but more than    of them have survived to some extent  nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics     of them are on astronomy  and    of them are on optics  with a few on other subjects  not all his surviving works have yet been studied  but some of the ones that have are given below 























alessandro allori

alessandro di cristofano di lorenzo del bronzino allori  florence     may        september       was an italian portrait painter of the late mannerist florentine school 

in       after the death of his father  he was brought up and trained in art by a close friend  often referred to as his  uncle   the mannerist painter agnolo bronzino  whose name he sometimes assumed in his pictures  in some ways  allori is the last of the line of prominent florentine painters  of generally undiluted tuscan artistic heritage  andrea del sarto worked with fra bartolomeo  as well as leonardo da vinci   pontormo briefly worked under andrea  and trained bronzino  who trained allori  subsequent generations in the city would be strongly influenced by the tide of baroque styles pre eminent in other parts of italy 

freedberg derides allori as derivative  claiming he illustrates  the ideal of maniera by which art  and style  are generated out of pre existing art   the polish of figures has an unnatural marble like form as if he aimed for cold statuary  it can be said of late phase mannerist painting in florence  that the city that had early breathed life into statuary with the works of masters like donatello and michelangelo  was still so awed by them that it petrified the poses of figures in painting  while by      the baroque elsewhere was beginning to give life to painted figures  florence was painting two dimensional statues  furthermore  in general  with the exception of the counter  maniera   counter mannerism  artists  it dared not stray from high themes or stray into high emotion 

among his collaborators was giovanni maria butteri and his main pupil was giovanni bizzelli  cristoforo del altissimo  cesare dandini  aurelio lomi  john mosnier  alessandro pieroni  giovanni battista vanni  and monanni also were his pupils  allori was one of the artists  working under vasari  included in the decoration of the studiolo of francesco  i 

he was the father of the painter cristofano allori               


in      the bbc foreign correspondent sir charles wheeler returned an original alessandro allori painting to the gem  ldegalerie  berlin  he had been given it in germany in       but only recently realized its origin and that it must have been looted in the wake of world war ii  the work is possibly a portrait of eleonora  dianora  di toledo de  medici  niece of eleonora di toledo  and measures     cm x     cm 






almoravid dynasty

the almoravid dynasty     imrab   en      al mur  bi     n   was an imperial berber muslim dynasty centered in morocco  it established an empire in the   th century that stretched over the western maghreb and al andalus  founded by abdallah ibn yasin  the almoravid capital was marrakesh  a city the ruling house founded in       the dynasty originated among the lamtuna and the gudala  nomadic berber tribes of the sahara  traversing the territory between the draa  the niger  and the senegal rivers 

the almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of al andalus to the iberian christian kingdoms  when they decisively defeated a coalition of the castilian and aragonese armies at the battle of sagrajas in       this enabled them to control an empire that stretched       kilometers         mi  north to south  however  the rule of the dynasty was relatively short lived  the almoravids fell   at the height of their power   when they failed to stop the masmuda led rebellion initiated by ibn tumart  as a result  their last king ishaq ibn ali was killed in marrakesh in april      by the almohad caliphate  who replaced them as a ruling dynasty both in morocco and al andalus 

the term  almoravid  comes from the arabic  al murabitun      which is the plural form of  al murabit    literally meaning  one who is tying  but figuratively meaning  one who is ready for battle at a fortress   the term is related to the notion of ribat  a frontier monastery fortress  through the root r b t    rabat    to tie to unite  or  raabat    to encamp   

the name  almoravid  was tied to a school of malikite law called  dar al murabitin  founded in sus al aksa  modern day morocco  by a scholar named waggag ibn zallu  ibn zallu sent his student abdallah ibn yasin to preach malikite islam to the sanhaja berbers of the sous and adrar  present day mauritania   hence  the name of the almoravids comes from the followers of the dar al murabitin   the house of those who were bound together in the cause of god   

it is uncertain exactly when or why the almoravids acquired that appellation  al bakri  writing in       before their apex  already calls them the  al murabitun   but does not clarify the reasons for it  writing three centuries later  ibn abi zar suggested it was chosen early on by abdallah ibn yasin because  upon finding resistance among the gudala berbers of adrar  mauritania  to his teaching  he took a handful of followers to erect a makeshift  ribat   monastery fortress  on an offshore island  possibly tidra island  in the bay of arguin   ibn idhari wrote that the name was suggested by ibn yasin in the  persevering in the fight  sense  to boost morale after a particularly hard fought battle in the draa valley c        in which they had taken many losses  whichever explanation is true  it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the almoravids for themselves  partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications 

the name might be related to the  ribat  of waggag ibn zallu in the village of aglu  near present day tiznit   where the future almoravid spiritual leader abdallah ibn yasin got his initial training  the   th century moroccan biographer ibn al zayyat al tadili  and qadi ayyad before him in the   th century  note that waggag s learning center was called  dar al murabitin   the house of the almoravids   and that might have inspired ibn yasin s choice of name for the movement 

contemporaries frequently referred to them as the  al mulathimun    the veiled ones   from  litham   arabic for  veil    the almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes with a tagelmust  a custom they adapted from southern sanhaja berbers   this can still be seen among the modern tuareg people  but it was unusual further north   although practical for the desert dust  the almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere  as a badge of  foreignness  in urban settings  partly as a way of emphasizing their puritan credentials  it served as the uniform of the almoravids  it was worn in remembrance of the sanhaja s escape from yemen disguised as women  thus making it simultaneously an indication of their faith  under their rule  sumptuary laws forbade anybody else from wearing the veil  thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class  in turn  the succeeding almohads made a point of mocking the almoravid veil as symbolic of effeminacy and decadence 

the berbers of the tamazgha in the early middle ages could be roughly classified into three major groups  the zenata across the north  the masmuda concentrated in central morocco  and the sanhaja  clustered in two areas  the western part of the sahara and the hills of the eastern maghreb  the eastern sanhaja included the kutama berbers  who had been the base of the fatimid rise in the early   th century  and the zirid dynasty  who ruled ifriqiya as vassals of the fatimids after the latter moved to egypt in      the western sanhaja were divided into several tribes  the gazzula and the lamta in the draa valley and the foothills of the anti atlas range  further south  encamped in the western sahara desert  were the massufa  the lamtuna and the banu warith  and most southerly of all  the gudala  or judala   in littoral mauritania down to the borderlands of the senegal river 

the western sanhaja had been converted to islam some time in the  th century  they were subsequently united in the   th century and  with the zeal of neophyte converts  launched several campaigns against the  sudanese   pagan peoples of sub saharan africa   under their king tinbarutan ibn usfayshar  the sanhaja lamtuna erected  or captured  the citadel of awdaghust  a critical stop on the trans saharan trade route  after the collapse of the sanhaja union  awdagust passed over to the ghana empire  and the trans saharan routes were taken over by the zenata maghrawa of sijilmassa  the maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the sanhaja gazzula and lamta out of their pasturelands in the sous and draa valleys  around       the lamtuna chieftain abu abdallah muhammad ibn tifat  alias tarsina   tried to reunite the sanhaja desert tribes  but his reign lasted less than three years 

around       yahya ibn ibrahim  a chieftain of the gudala  and brother in law of the late tarsina   went on pilgrimage to mecca  on his return  he stopped by kairouan in ifriqiya  where he met abu imran al fasi  a native of fes and a jurist and scholar of the sunni maliki school  at this time  ifriqiya was in ferment  the zirid ruler al muizz ibn badis  was openly contemplating breaking with his shi ite fatimid overlords in cairo  and the jurists of kairouan were agitating for him to do so  within this heady atmosphere  yahya and abu imran fell into conversation on the state of the faith in their western homelands  and yahya expressed his disappointment at the lack of religious education and negligence of islamic law among his southern sanhaja people  with abu imran s recommendation  yahya ibn ibrahim made his way to the  ribat  of waggag ibn zelu in the sous valley of southern morocco  to seek out a maliki teacher for his people  waggag assigned him one of his residents  abdallah ibn yasin 

abdallah ibn yasin was a gazzula berber  and probably a convert rather than a born muslim  his name can be read as  son of ya sin   the title of the   th sura of the qur an   suggesting he had obliterated his family past and was  re born  of the holy book  ibn yasin certainly had the ardor of a puritan zealot  his creed was mainly characterized by a rigid formalism and a strict adherence to the dictates of the qur an  and the orthodox tradition   chroniclers such as al bakri allege ibn yasin s learning was superficial   ibn yasin s initial meetings with the gudala people went poorly  as he had more ardor than depth  ibn yasin s arguments were disputed by his audience  he responded to questioning with charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations  the gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his protector  yahya ibn ibrahim  sometime in the     s 

ibn yasin  however  found a more favorable reception among the neighboring lamtuna people  probably sensing the useful organizing power of ibn yasin s pious fervor  the lamtuna chieftain yahya ibn umar al lamtuni invited the man to preach to his people  the lamtuna leaders  however  kept ibn yasin on a careful leash  forging a more productive partnership between them  invoking stories of the early life of muhammad  ibn yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to islamicization  that it was not enough to merely adhere to god s law  but necessary to also destroy opposition to it  in ibn yasin s ideology  anything and everything outside of islamic law could be characterized as  opposition   he identified tribalism  in particular  as an obstacle  he believed it was not enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences  and embrace the equality of all muslims under the sacred law  it was necessary to make them do so  for the lamtuna leadership  this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to refound the sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions  in the early     s  the lamtuna  under the joint leadership of yahya ibn umar and abdallah ibn yasin   soon calling themselves the  al murabitin   almoravids    set out on a campaign to bring their neighbors over to their cause 

from the year       the almoravids began to spread their religious way to the berber areas of the sahara  and to the regions south of the desert  after winning over the sanhaja berber tribe  they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route  seizing sijilmasa at the northern end in       and aoudaghost at the southern end in       yahya ibn umar was killed in a battle in       but abdullah ibn yasin  whose influence as a religious teacher was paramount  named his brother abu bakr ibn umar as chief  under him  the almoravids soon began to spread their power beyond the desert  and conquered the tribes of the atlas mountains  they then came in contact with the berghouata  a berber tribal confederation  who followed an islamic  heresy  preached by salih ibn tarif three centuries earlier  the berghouata resisted  abdullah ibn yasin was killed in battle with them in       in krifla  a village near rommani  morocco  they were  however  completely conquered by abu bakr ibn umar  and were forced to convert to orthodox islam  abu bakr married a noble and wealthy berber woman  zaynab an nafzawiyyat  who would become very influential in the development of the dynasty  zaynab was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from houara  who was said to be from kairouan 

in       abu bakr ibn umar made a division of the power he had established  handing over the more settled parts to his cousin yusuf ibn tashfin as viceroy  and also assigning to him his favourite wife zaynab  ibn umar kept the task of suppressing the revolts that had broken out in the desert  when he returned to resume control  he found his cousin too powerful to be superseded  in november       abu bakr was killed in battle   according to oral tradition by an arrow  while fighting in the historic region of the sudan 

yusuf ibn tashfin had in the meantime brought the large area of what is now known as morocco  western sahara  and mauritania into complete subjection  in      he founded the city of marrakech  in       he conquered the kingdom of tlemcen  in modern day algeria  and founded the present city of that name  his rule extending as far east as oran 

according to arab tradition  the almoravids conquered the ghana empire sometime around      ce  an example of this tradition is the record of historian ibn khaldun  who cited shaykh uthman  the faqih of ghana  writing in       according to this source  the almoravids weakened ghana and collected tribute from the sudan  to the extent that the authority of the rulers of ghana dwindled away  and they were subjugated and absorbed by the susu  a neighboring people of the sudan  traditions in mali related that the soso attacked and took over mali as well  and the ruler of the soso  sumaouro kant   took over the land 

however criticism from conrad and fisher        argued that the notion of any almoravid military conquest at its core is merely perpetuated folklore  derived from a misinterpretation or naive reliance on arabic sources  according to professor timothy insoll  the archaeology of ancient ghana simply does not show the signs of rapid change and destruction that would be associated with any almoravid era military conquests 

dierke lange agreed with the original military incursion theory but argues that this doesn t preclude almoravid political agitation  claiming that the main factor of the demise of ghana empire owed much to the latter  according to lange  the almoravid religious influence was gradual and not heavily involved in military strife  there the almoravids increased in power by marrying among the nation s nobility  lange attributes the decline of ancient ghana to numerous unrelated factors  only one of which can be likely attributable to internal dynastic struggles that were instigated by almoravid influence and islamic pressures  but devoid of military conversion and conquest 

this interpretation of events has been disputed by later scholars like sheryl l  burkhalter         who argued that  whatever the nature of the  conquest  in the south of the sahara  the influence and success of the almoravid movement in securing west african gold and circulating it widely necessitated a high degree of political control 

the traditional position says that the ensuing war with the almoravids pushed ghana over the edge  ending the kingdom s position as a commercial and military power by       it collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies  some of which later assimilated into the almoravids while others founded the mali empire 

the arab geographer al zuhri wrote that the almoravids ended ibadism in tadmekka in      and that abu bakr  arrived at the mountain of gold  in the deep south 
after the death of abu bakr         the confederation of berber tribes in the sahara was divided between the descendants of abu bakr and his brother yahya  and would have lost control of ghana  sheryl burkhalter suggests that abu bakr   s son yahya was the leader of the almoravid expedition that conquered ghana in       and that the almoravids would have survived the loss of ghana and the defeat in the maghreb by the almohads  and would have ruled the sahara until the end of the   th century 

in      yusuf ibn tashfin was invited by the muslim  taifa  princes of al andalus in the iberian peninsula to defend their territories from the encroachment of alfonso vi  king of le  n and castile  in that year  yusuf ibn tashfin crossed the strait of gibraltar to algeciras  and defeated castile at the battle of az zallaqah  battle of sagrajas   he was prevented from following up his victory by trouble in africa  which he chose to settle in person 

he returned to iberia in       avowedly for the purpose of annexing the  taifa  principalities of iberia  he was supported by most of the iberian people  who were discontented with the heavy taxation imposed upon them by their spendthrift rulers  their religious teachers  as well as others in the east   most notably  al ghazali in persia and al tartushi in egypt  who was himself an iberian by birth from tortosa   detested the  taifa  rulers for their religious indifference  the clerics issued a  fatwa   a non binding legal opinion  that yusuf was of sound morals and had the religious right to dethrone the rulers  whom he saw as heterodox in their faith  by       yusuf had annexed most of the major  taifas   with the exception of the one at saragossa  the almoravids were victorious at the battle of consuegra  during which the son of el cid  diego rodr  guez  perished  alfonso  with some le  nese  retreated into the castle of consuegra  which was besieged for eight days until the almoravids withdrew to the south 

after friendly correspondence with the caliph at baghdad  whom he acknowledged as  amir al mu minin    commander of the faithful    yusuf ibn tashfin in      assumed the title of  amir al muslimin    commander of the muslims    he died in       when he was reputed to have reached the age of      the almoravid power was at its height at yusuf s death  the moorish empire then included all of northwest africa as far eastward as algiers  and all of iberia south of the tagus and as far eastward as the mouth of the ebro  and including the balearic islands 

in      tamim al yusuf defeated the kingdom of castile at the battle of ucl  s  yusuf did not reconquer much territory from the christian kingdoms  except that of valencia  but he did hinder the progress of the christian reconquista by uniting al andalus  in      at the battle of fraga the almoravids dynasty was victorious and even succeeded in slaying alfonso i of aragon in the battle 

three years afterwards  under yusuf s son and successor  ali ibn yusuf  sintra and santar  m were added  and he invaded iberia again in      and       but the tide had turned  as the french had assisted the aragonese to recover zaragoza  in       ali ibn yusuf was defeated by alfonso vii of le  n  and in the battle of ourique         by afonso i of portugal  who thereby won his crown  lisbon was conquered by the portuguese in      

according to some scholars  ali ibn yusuf was a new generation of leadership that had forgotten the desert life for the comforts of the city  he was defeated by the combined action of his christian foes in iberia and the agitation of almohads  the muwahhids  in morocco  after ali ibn yusuf s death in       his son tashfin ibn ali lost ground rapidly before the almohads  in      he was killed in a fall from a precipice while attempting to escape after a defeat near oran 

his two successors were ibrahim ibn tashfin and ishaq ibn ali  but their reigns were short  the conquest of the city of marrakech by the almohads in      marked the fall of the dynasty  though fragments of the almoravids continued to struggle throughout the empire  among these fragments  there was the rebel yahya al sahr  wiyya  who resisted almohad rule in the maghrib for eight years after the fall of marrakech before surrendering in       also in       the remaining almoravids were forced to retreat to the balearic islands and later ifriqiya under the leadership of the banu ghaniya  who were eventually influential in the downfall of their conquerors  the almohads  in the eastern part of the maghrib 

abdallah ibn yassin imposed very strict discipline measures on his forces for every breach of his laws  the almoravids  first military leader  yahya ibn umar al lamtuni  gave them a good military organization  their main force was infantry  armed with javelins in the front ranks and pikes behind  which formed into a phalanx  and was supported by camelmen and horsemen on the flanks  they also had a flag carrier at the front who guided the forces behind him  when the flag was upright  the combatants behind would stand and when it was turned down  they would sit 

al bakri reports that  while in combat  the almoravids did not pursue those who fled in front of them  their fighting was intense and they did not retreat when disadvantaged by an advancing opposing force  they preferred death over defeat  these characteristics were possibly unusual at the time 

after the death of el cid  christian chronicles reported a legend of a turkish woman leading a band of      amazons   black female archers  this legend was possibly inspired by the ominous veils on the faces of the warriors and their dark skin colored blue by the indigo of their robes 






aloe

aloe        also written  alo     is a genus containing over     species of flowering succulent plants  the most widely known species is  aloe vera   or  true aloe   so called because it is cultivated as the standard source of so called  aloe vera  for assorted pharmaceutical purposes  other species  such as  aloe ferox   also are cultivated or harvested from the wild for similar applications 

the apg iv system        places the genus in the family asphodelaceae  subfamily asphodeloideae  within the subfamily it may be placed in the tribe aloeae  in the past  it has been assigned to the family aloaceae  now included in the asphodeloidae  or to a broadly circumscribed family liliaceae  the lily family   the plant  agave americana   which is sometimes called  american aloe   belongs to the asparagaceae  a different family 

the genus is native to tropical and southern africa  madagascar  jordan  the arabian peninsula  and various islands in the indian ocean  mauritius  r  union  comoros  etc    a few species have also become naturalized in other regions  mediterranean  india  australia  north and south america  hawaiian islands  etc   

most  aloe  species have a rosette of large  thick  fleshy leaves   aloe  flowers are tubular  frequently yellow  orange  pink  or red  and are borne  densely clustered and pendant  at the apex of simple or branched  leafless stems  many species of  aloe  appear to be stemless  with the rosette growing directly at ground level  other varieties may have a branched or unbranched stem from which the fleshy leaves spring  they vary in color from grey to bright green and are sometimes striped or mottled  some aloes native to south africa are tree like  arborescent  

the apg iv system        places the genus in the family asphodelaceae  subfamily asphodeloideae  in the past it has also been assigned to the families liliaceae and aloeaceae  as well as the family asphodelaceae sensu stricto  before this was merged into the asphodelaceae sensu lato 

the circumscription of the genus has varied widely  many genera  such as  lomatophyllum   have been brought into synonymy  species at one time placed in  aloe   such as  agave americana   have been moved to other genera  molecular phylogenetic studies  particularly from      onwards  suggested that as then circumscribed   aloe  was not monophyletic and should be divided into more tightly defined genera  in       john charles manning and coworkers produced a phylogeny in which  aloe  was divided into six genera   aloidendron    kumara    aloiampelos    aloe    aristaloe  and  gonialoe  

over     species are accepted in the genus  aloe   plus even more synonyms and unresolved species  subspecies  varieties  and hybrids  some of the accepted species are 

in addition to the species and hybrids between species within the genus  several hybrids with other genera have been created in cultivation  such as between  aloe  and  gasteria      gasteraloe    and between  aloe  and  astroloba      aloloba   

aloe species are frequently cultivated as ornamental plants both in gardens and in pots  many aloe species are highly decorative and are valued by collectors of succulents   aloe vera  is used both internally and externally on humans as folk or alternative medicine  the plants can also be made into types of special soaps or used in other skin care products  see natural skin care  

numerous cultivars with mixed or uncertain parentage are grown  of these   aloe     lizard lips    has gained the royal horticultural society   s award of garden merit 

historical use of various aloe species is well documented  documentation of the clinical effectiveness is available  although relatively limited 

of the      species  only a few were used traditionally as herbal medicines   aloe vera  again being the most commonly used species  also included are  a  perryi  and  a  ferox   the ancient greeks and romans used  aloe vera  to treat wounds  in the middle ages  the yellowish liquid found inside the leaves was favored as a purgative  unprocessed aloe that contains aloin is generally used as a laxative  whereas processed juice does not usually contain significant aloin 

some species  particularly  aloe vera   are used in alternative medicine and first aid  both the translucent inner pulp and the resinous yellow aloin from wounding the aloe plant are used externally for skin discomforts  as an herbal medicine   aloe vera  juice is commonly used internally for digestive discomfort 

according to cancer research uk  a potentially deadly product called t up is made of concentrated aloe  and promoted as a cancer cure  they say  there is currently no evidence that aloe products can help to prevent or treat cancer in humans  

on may          the us food and drug administration issued a final rule banning the use of aloin  the yellow sap of the aloe plant  for use as a laxative ingredient in over the counter drug products  most aloe juices today do not contain significant aloin 

according to w  a  shenstone  two classes of aloins are recognized      nataloins  which yield picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid  and do not give a red coloration with nitric acid  and     barbaloins  which yield aloetic acid  chno   chrysammic acid  chno   picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid  being reddened by the acid  this second group may be divided into a barbaloins  obtained from barbados  aloe   and reddened in the cold  and b barbaloins  obtained from  aloe socotrina  and zanzibar  aloe   reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold  nataloin   cho  ho  forms bright yellow scales  barbaloin  cho  prismatic crystals   aloe  species also contain a trace of volatile oil  to which their odour is due 

 aloe perryi    a  barbadensis    a  ferox   and hybrids of this species with  a  africana  and  a  spicata  are listed as natural flavoring substances in the us government  electronic code of federal regulations    aloe socotrina  is said to be used in yellow chartreuse 

 aloe rubrolutea  occurs as a charge in heraldry  for example in the civic heraldry of namibia 






alyattes of lydia

alyattes  reigned c       c     bc   sometimes described as alyattes ii  was the fourth king of the mermnad dynasty in lydia  the son of sadyattes and grandson of ardys  he was succeeded by his son croesus  a battle between his forces and those of cyaxares  king of media  was interrupted by the solar eclipse on    may     bc  after this  a truce was agreed and alyattes married his daughter aryenis to astyages  the son of cyaxares  the alliance preserved lydia for another generation  during which it enjoyed its most brilliant period  alyattes continued to wage a war against miletus for many years but eventually he heeded the delphic oracle and rebuilt a temple  dedicated to athena  which his soldiers had destroyed  he then made peace with miletus  

dates for the mermnad kings are uncertain and are based on a computation by j  b  bury and russell meiggs        who estimated c       c     bc for the reign of gyges  herodotus gave reign lengths for gyges  successors  but there is uncertainty about these as the total exceeds the timespan between      probable death of gyges  fighting the cimmerians  and          fall of sardis to cyrus the great   bury and meiggs concluded that ardys and sadyattes reigned through an unspecified period in the second half of the  th century bc  but they did not propose dates for alyattes except their assertion that croesus succeeded him in     bc  the timespan           bc for the reign of croesus is almost certainly accurate 

for several years alyattes continued the war against the greek colony of miletus begun by his father sadyattes  but was obliged to turn his attention towards the medes and babylonians  on    may     bc  during the battle of halys fought against cyaxares  king of media  a solar eclipse occurred  hostilities were suspended  peace concluded  and the halys river was fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms 

alyattes drove the cimmerians from asia minor  with the help of war dogs  he further subdued the carians  and took several ionian cities  including smyrna and colophon  smyrna was sacked and destroyed with its inhabitants forced to move into the countryside 

he created the first coins in history  marking them with the amount of precious metal  either gold or silver  they contained and an imprint that identified the issuer who guaranteed its contents  almost all coins used today descended from his coin  he standardised the weight of coins    stater       grains of wheat   the coins were produced using an anvil die technique and stamped with a lion s head  the symbol of the mermnadae 

alyattes  tomb still exists on the plateau between lake gygaea and the river hermus to the north of the lydian capital sardis     a large mound of earth with a substructure of huge stones  it was excavated by spiegelthal in       who found that it covered a large vault of finely cut marble blocks approached by a flat roofed passage of the same stone from the south  the sarcophagus and its contents had been removed by early plunderers of the tomb  all that was left were some broken alabaster vases  pottery and charcoal  on the summit of the mound were large phalli of stone 

herodotus described the tomb 

some authors have suggested that buddhist stupas were derived from a wider cultural tradition from the mediterranean to the indus valley  and can be related to the funeral conical mounds on circular bases that can be found in lydia or in phoenicia from the  th century bce  such as the tomb of alyattes 

in  the histories   herodotus recounts how alyattes continued his father s war against miletus  according to herodotus  sadyattes had invaded miletus annually to burn their crops over the course of six years  the troops left the horses and houses untouched so that the milesians could plant a new crop  which the lydians would then burn the following year  alyattes did the same over the next five years until the end of the war 

the end came about because of a lydian fire which  driven out of control by a strong wind  destroyed the temple of athene at assesos  soon afterwards  alyattes became seriously ill and decided to asked the delphic oracle for advice  the priestess refused to answer his emissary until the lydians had rebuilt the temple  alyattes immediately sent an embassy to miletus and agreed a peace treaty  the temple was rebuilt and alyattes recovered his health

age of consent

the age of consent is the age below which a minor is considered to be legally incompetent to consent to sexual acts  consequently  an adult who engages in sexual activity with a minor younger than the age of consent cannot claim that the sexual activity was consensual  and such sexual activity may be considered statutory rape  the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and their sex partner is regarded as the offender  unless both are underage  the purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage person from sexual advances 

the term  age of consent  rarely appears in legal statutes  generally  a law will instead establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with that person  it has sometimes been used with other meanings  such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to marriage  but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood  it should not be confused with other laws regarding age minimums including  but not limited to  the age of majority  age of criminal responsibility  voting age  drinking age  and driving age 

age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range    to     the laws may also vary by the type of sexual act  the gender of the participants or other considerations  such as involving a position of trust  some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other  rather than a single age  charges and penalties resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a misdemeanor  such as  corruption of a minor   to what is popularly called  statutory rape  

there are many  grey areas  in this area of law  some regarding unspecific and untried legislation  others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes  and others due to conflicts between federal and state laws  these factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject  and a topic of highly charged debates 


in traditional societies  the age of consent for a sexual union was a matter for the family to decide  or a tribal custom  in most cases  this coincided with signs of puberty  menstruation for a woman  and pubic hair for a man  the ancient greek poet hesiod in  works and days   c       bc  suggests that a man should marry around the age of thirty  and that he should take a wife who is five years past puberty 

reliable data for ages at marriage is scarce  in england  for example  the only reliable data in the early modern period comes from property records made after death  not only were the records relatively rare  but not all bothered to record the participants  ages  and it seems that the more complete the records are  the more likely they are to reveal young marriages  modern historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept evidence of young ages of marriage  dismissing it as a  misreading  by a later copier of the records 

in the   th century  gratian  the influential founder of canon law in medieval europe  accepted the age of puberty for marriage to be around twelve for girls and around fourteen for boys but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if both children were older than seven years of age  there were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier  marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty  or if they had already consummated the marriage  judges sometimes honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger than  seven  in contrast to established canon  there are recorded marriages of two  and three year olds 

the first  recorded  age of consent law dates from      in england  as part of its provisions on rape  the statute of westminster      made it a misdemeanor to  ravish  a  maiden within age   whether with or without her consent  the phrase  within age  was later interpreted by jurist sir edward coke  england    th century  as meaning the age of marriage  which at the time was twelve years of age 

the american colonies followed the english tradition  and the law was more of a guide  for example  mary hathaway  virginia        was only nine when she was married to william williams  sir edward coke  made it clear that the marriage of girls under    was normal  and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a dower from her husband s estate was   even though her husband be only four years old  

in the   th century  a small number of italian and german states set the minimum age for sexual intercourse for girls  setting it at twelve years  towards the end of the   th century  other european countries also began to enact similar laws  the first french constitution of      established the minimum age at eleven years  portugal  spain  denmark and the swiss cantons initially set the minimum age at ten to twelve years 

age of consent laws were  historically  difficult to follow and enforce  legal norms based on  age  were not  in general  common until the   th century  because clear proof of exact age and precise date of birth were often unavailable 

in christian societies  sex outside marriage was forbidden  older children were themselves often punished for being complicit in sexual interaction with an adult  western christianity also deemed that children were born into the original sin  and  as such  were perceived as inherently immoral  children had very few rights and were considered the chattel of the father  from the late   th century  and especially in the   th century  attitudes started to change  by the mid   th century there was increased concern over child sexual abuse 

a general shift in social and legal attitudes toward issues of sex occurred during the modern era  attitudes on the appropriate age of permission for females to engage in sexual activity drifted toward adulthood  while ages from ten to thirteen years were typically regarded as acceptable ages for sexual consent in western countries during the mid   th century  by the end of the   th century changing attitudes towards sexuality and childhood resulted in the raising of the age of consent 

english common law had traditionally set the age of consent within the range of ten to twelve years old  but the offences against the person act      raised this to thirteen in great britain and ireland  early feminists of the social purity movement  such as josephine butler and others  instrumental in securing the repeal of the contagious diseases acts  began to turn towards the problem of child prostitution by the end of the     s  sensational media revelations about the scourge of child prostitution in london in the     s then caused outrage among the respectable middle classes  leading to pressure for the age of consent to be raised again 

the investigative journalist william thomas stead of the  pall mall gazette  was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the london underworld through a publicity stunt  in      he  purchased  one victim  eliza armstrong  the thirteen year old daughter of a chimney sweep  for five pounds and took her to a brothel where she was drugged  he then published a series of four expos  s entitled  the maiden tribute of modern babylon   which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction  procurement  and sale of young english virgins to continental  pleasure palaces   the  maiden tribute  was an instant sensation with the reading public  and victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution  fearing riots on a national scale  the home secretary  sir william harcourt  pleaded in vain with stead to cease publication of the articles  a wide variety of reform groups held protest meetings and marched together to hyde park demanding that the age of consent be raised  the government was forced to propose the criminal law amendment act       which raised the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen and clamped down on prostitution 

in the united states  as late as the     s most states set the minimum age at ten to twelve  in delaware  it was seven in        inspired by the  maiden tribute  articles  female reformers in the u s  initiated their own campaign  which petitioned legislators to raise the legal minimum age to at least sixteen  with the ultimate goal to raise the age to eighteen  the campaign was successful  with almost all states raising the minimum age to sixteen to eighteen years by      

in france  portugal  denmark  the swiss cantons and other countries  the minimum age was raised to between thirteen and sixteen years in the following decades  though the original arguments for raising the age of consent were based on morality  since then the  raison d   tre  of the laws has changed to child welfare and a so called right to childhood or innocence 

in france  under the napoleonic code  the age of consent was set in      at eleven  and was raised to thirteen in       it was increased to fifteen in      

in spain  it was set in      at  puberty age   and changed to twelve in       which was kept until       when it became     and in      it was raised to    

in the   st century  concerns about child sex tourism and commercial sexual exploitation of children gained international prominence  and have resulted in legislative changes in several jurisdictions  as well as in the adoption of several international instruments 

the council of europe convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse  lanzarote     october        and the european union s  directive         eu of the european parliament and of the council  of    december      on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography were adopted 

the optional protocol on the sale of children  child prostitution and child pornography came into force in      

the protocol to prevent  suppress and punish trafficking in persons  especially women and children  which came into force in       prohibits commercial sexual exploitation of children 

the council of europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings  which came into force in       also deals with commercial sexual exploitation of children 

several western countries have raised their ages of consent recently  these include canada  in        from    to      and in europe  iceland  in        from    to      lithuania  in        from    to      croatia  in        from    to      and spain  in        from    to     

the international criminal court statute does not provide a specific age of consent in its rape sexual violence statute  but makes reference to sexual acts committed against persons   incapable of giving genuine consent    and the explicative footnote states   it is understood that a person may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural  induced or  age related incapacity     see note    

sexual relations with a person under the age of consent is a crime in most countries  exceptions to this include  yemen  and saudi arabia  jurisdictions use a variety of terms for the offense  including  child sexual abuse    statutory rape    illegal carnal knowledge    corruption of a minor   besides others 

the enforcement practices of age of consent laws vary depending on the social sensibilities of the particular culture  see above   often  enforcement is not exercised to the letter of the law  with legal action being taken only when a sufficiently socially unacceptable age gap exists between the two individuals  or if the perpetrator is in a position of power over the minor  e g  a teacher  minister  or doctor   the sex of each participant can also influence perceptions of an individual s guilt and therefore enforcement 

the threshold age for engaging in sexual activity varies between jurisdictions  see above   most jurisdictions have set a fixed age of consent  however  some jurisdictions permit sex with a person after the onset of their puberty  such as yemen  but only in marriage  ages can also vary based on the type of calendar used  such as the lunar calendar  how birth dates in leap years are handled  or even the method by which birth date is calculated 

the age of consent is a legal barrier to the minor s ability to consent and therefore obtaining consent is not in general a defense to having sexual relations with a person under the prescribed age  for example 


a growing number of countries have specific extraterritorial legislation that prosecutes their citizens in their homeland should they engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign country with children  in       ecpat reported that    countries had extraterritorial child sex legislation  for example  protect act of       a federal united states law bans sexual activity by its citizens with foreigners or with u s  citizens from another state  if the partner is under    and the activity is illegal under the federal  state  or local law  this applies in cases where any of the partners travels into or out of the united states  or from one state into another  for the purpose of an illegal sexual encounter 

there is debate as to whether the gender of those involved should lead to different treatment of the sexual encounter  in law or in practice  traditionally  age of consent laws regarding vaginal intercourse were often meant to protect the chastity of unmarried girls  many feminists and social campaigners in the     s have objected to the social importance of virginity  and have also attempted to change the stereotypes of female passivity and male aggression  demanding that the law protect children from exploitation regardless of their gender  rather than dealing with concerns of chastity  this has led to gender neutral laws in many jurisdictions  on the other hand  there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an  unequal act  for males and females  due to issues such as pregnancy  increased risk of stds  and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready  in the us  in  michael m  v  superior ct     u s              it was ruled that the double standard of offering more legal protection to girls is valid because  the equal protection clause does not mean that the physiological differences between men and women must be disregarded  

traditionally  many age of consent laws dealt primarily with men engaging in sexual acts with underage girls and boys  the latter acts often falling under sodomy and buggery laws   this means that in some legal systems  issues of women having sexual contact with underage partners were rarely acknowledged  for example  until       in the uk  before the sexual offences  amendment  act       there was no statutory age of consent for lesbian sex  in new zealand  before       there were no age of consent laws dealing with women having sex with underage boys  previously  in fiji  male offenders of child sexual abuse could receive up to life imprisonment  whilst female offenders would receive up to seven years  situations like these have been attributed to societal views on traditional gender roles  and to constructs of male sexuality and female sexuality  according to e martellozzo    v iewing females as perpetrators of sexual abuse goes against every stereotype that society has of women  women as mothers and caregivers and not as people who abuse and harm   alissa nutting argues that women are not acknowledged as perpetrators of sex crimes because society does not accept that women have an autonomous sexuality of their own 

the age at which a person can be legally married can differ from the age of consent  in jurisdictions where the marriageable age is lower than the age of consent  those laws usually override the age of consent laws in the case of a married couple where one or both partners are below the age of consent  some jurisdictions prohibit all sex outside of marriage irrespective of age  as in the case of yemen 

in many countries  there are specific laws dealing with child prostitution 

in some countries  states  or other jurisdictions  the age of consent may be lower than the age at which a person can appear in pornographic images and films  in many jurisdictions  the minimum age for participation and even viewing such material is     as such  in some jurisdictions  films and images showing individuals under the age of     but above the age of consent  that meet the legal definition of child pornography are prohibited despite the fact that the sexual acts depicted are legal to engage in otherwise under that jurisdiction s age of consent laws  in those cases  it is only the filming of the sex act that is the crime as the act itself would not be considered a sex crime  for example  in the united states under federal law it is a crime to film minors below    in sexual acts  even in states where the age of consent is below     in those states  charges such as child pornography can be used to prosecute someone having sex with a minor  who could not be otherwise be prosecuted for statutory rape  provided they filmed or photographed the act 

jailbait images can be differentiated from child pornography  as they do not feature minors before the onset of puberty  nor do they contain nudity  the images are  however  usually sexualized  often featuring tween or young teen girls in bikinis  skirts  underwear or lingerie  whether or not these images are legal is debated  when questioned regarding their legality legal analyst jeffrey toobin stated he thought it was not illegal  though legal expert sunny hostin was more skeptical  describing jailbait images as  borderline  child pornography which may be illegal 

the human immune system continues to develop after puberty  the age of exposure has an influence upon if the immune system can fend off infections in general  and this is also true in the case of some sexually transmitted diseases  for example  a risk factor for hpv strains causing genital warts is sexual debut at a young age  if this extends to the cancer causing strains  then sexual debut at a young age would potentially also increase risk of persistence of hpv infections that cause the very hpv induced cancers that are being diagnosed in spiking numbers of relatively young people 

age of consent reform refers to the efforts of some individuals or groups  for different reasons  to alter or abolish age of consent laws  these efforts advocate five main positions 






alypius of antioch

alypius of antioch was a geographer and a vicarius of roman britain  probably in the late    s ad  he replaced flavius martinus after that vicarius  suicide  his rule is recorded is ammianus xxiii      

he came from antioch and served under constantius ii and was probably appointed to ensure that nobody with western associations was serving in britain during a time of mistrust  rebellion and suppression symbolised by the brutal acts of the imperial notary paulus catena  he may have had to deal with the insurrection of the usurper named carausius ii 

alypius was afterwards commissioned to rebuild the temple in jerusalem as part of julian s systematic attempt to reverse the christianization of the roman empire by restoring pagan and  in this case  jewish practices  among the letters of julian are two     and     addressed to alypius  one inviting him to rome  the other thanking him for a geographical treatise  which no longer exists 





amalasuntha

amalasuntha  also known as amalasuentha  amalaswintha  amalasuintha  amalswinthe  amalasontha or amalsenta      april          was a regent of the ostrogoths during the minority of her son from     to      and ruling queen regnant from     to      she was the youngest daughter of theoderic the great  and firmly believed in the upholding of roman virtues and values  she is best known for her diplomatic relationship with justinian i  who would invade italy in response to her assassination 

in      amalasuntha married eutharic        an ostrogoth noble of the old amali dynasty who had been previously living in the arian kingdom of hispania  her husband was the son of widerich  born    grandson of berismund  born    and great grandson of thorismund  died after       king of the ostrogoths   it was important to amalasuntha s father  theoderic the great  that she marry into a legitimate royal family  lest her own family s legitimacy be questioned 

she was very much an intellectual  and was well known for her extensive knowledge  which included the study of three languages  latin  greek and gothic  in addition  she was a student of philosophy and was said to possess the wisdom of solomon  amalasuntha was also described in her day as possessing all of the central roman virtues expected of a noble woman  happiness  fertility  and patience  although more emphasis was placed on her virtues within the political realm versus the feminine  something that separates her from other ostrogoth princesses 

her husband died  apparently in the early years of her marriage  leaving her with two children  athalaric and matasuntha  after       wife of germanus  on the death of her father on    august      her son succeeded him at the age of ten  but she held the power as regent for her son  her tremendous influence in her position as regent can be seen in a diptych she appears in alongside her son  athalaric  in      deeply imbued with the old roman culture  she gave to that son s education a more refined and literary turn than suited the ideas of her gothic subjects  conscious of her unpopularity she banished     and afterwards put to death     three gothic nobles whom she suspected of conspiring against her rule  at the same time  she opened negotiations with the byzantine emperor justinian i with the view of removing herself and the gothic treasure to constantinople  her son s death on   october     initially made little apparent change in the posture of affairs 

after athalaric s death  amalasuntha became queen  ruling independently only for a short while before making her cousin theodahad partner of her throne  not  as sometimes stated  her husband  for his wife was still living   with the intent of strengthening her position  theodahad was a prominent leader of the gothic military aristocracy  the very group that so opposed her pro roman stances  amalasuntha believed this pairing would help to make supporters out of her harshest critics  the choice was unfortunate  for theodahad fostered the disaffection of the goths  and either by his orders or with his permission  amalasuntha was imprisoned in the island of martana in the tuscan lake of bolsena  where on    april in the spring of         she was murdered in her bath 

the death of amalasuntha would give justinian a reason to go to war with the ostrogoths and attempt to take italy  according to the eastern roman historian procopius  it is believed that amalasuntha and justinian i had a very close diplomatic relationship  more specifically  procopius believed that amalasuntha was thinking about handing over italy to justinian around the time of her death  shortly after amalasuntha s murder  theodahad was replaced by witigis  amalasuntha s son in law  with the people s support  witigis had theodahad put to death 

the letters of cassiodorus  chief minister and literary adviser of amalasuntha  and the histories of procopius and jordanes  give us our chief information as to the character of amalasuntha  cassiodorus was a part of a greater pro roman party that desired to romanize the traditional ostrogothic kingship  further evidence of the pro roman circle that amalasuntha surrounded herself with 

the life of amalasuntha was made the subject of a tragedy  the first play written by the young carlo goldoni and presented at milan in      

asteroid     amalasuntha is named in her honour 




amalric of bena

amalric of bena      died             ad  was a french theologian and sect leader  after whom the amalricians are named 

amalric was born in the latter part of the   th century at bennes  a village between oll   and chauffours in the diocese of chartres 

amalric taught philosophy and theology at the university of paris and enjoyed a great reputation as a subtle dialectician  his lectures developing the philosophy of aristotle attracted a large circle of hearers  in      his doctrines were condemned by the university and  on a personal appeal to pope innocent iii  the sentence was ratified  amalric being ordered to return to paris and recant his errors 

his death was caused  it is said  by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected 
in       ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of paris and amalric s own body was exhumed and burnt and the ashes given to the winds  the doctrines of his followers  known as the amalricians  were formally condemned by the fourth lateran council in      

amalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from eriugena  whose principles he developed in a one sided and strongly pantheistic form 

three propositions only can with certainty be attributed to him 

because of the first proposition  god himself is thought as invisible and only recognizable in his creation 

these three propositions were further developed by his followers  who maintained that god revealed himself in a threefold revelation  the first in the biblical patriarch abraham  marking the  epoch of the father   the second in jesus christ  who began the  epoch of the son   and the third in amalric and his disciples  who inaugurated the  era of the holy ghost  

amalricians taught 

due to persecutions  this sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder  not long after the burning of ten of their members         the sect itself lost its importance  while some of the surviving amalricians became brethren of the free spirit 

according to hosea ballou  then pierre batiffol and george t  knight        amalric was a believer that all people would eventually be saved and this was one of the counts upon which he was declared a heretic by pope innocent iii

afonso i of portugal

afonso i       july             or august              december        nicknamed the conqueror     the founder    or the great    by the portuguese  and  el bortukali   in arabic     the portuguese   and  ibn arrink   in arabic or     son of henry    henriques   by the moors whom he fought  was the first king of portugal  he achieved the independence of the southern part of the kingdom of galicia  the county of portugal  from galicia s overlord  the king of le  n  in       establishing a new kingdom and doubling its area with the  reconquista   an objective that he pursued until his death in       after forty six years of wars against the moors 

afonso was the son of henry of burgundy and teresa  the natural daughter of king alfonso vi of le  n and castile  according to fern  o lopes   cr  nica de portugal de        the future portuguese king was born in guimar  es  which was at the time the most important political center of his parents  this was accepted by most portuguese scholarship until in      torquato de sousa soares proposed coimbra  the center of the county of coimbra and another political center of afonso s progenitors  as his birthplace  which caused outrage in guimar  es and a polemic between this historian and jos   hermano saraiva  almeida fernandes later proposed viseu as the birthplace of afonso basing himself on the  chronica gothorum   which states afonso was born in       a position followed by jos   mattoso in his biography of the king  abel estef  nio has suggested a different date and thesis  proposing      as the birth date and the region of tierra de campos or even sahag  n as likely birth places based on the known itineraries of counts henry and teresa 

the pair reigned jointly as count and countess of portugal until henry s death on    may      during the siege of astorga  after which teresa reigned alone 

it is not known who was the tutor of afonso  later traditions  probably started with jo  o soares coelho  a bastard descendant of egas moniz through a female line  in the mid   th century and ampliated by later chronicles such as the  cr  nica de portugal de        asserted he had been egas moniz de ribadouro  possibly with the help of oral memories that associated the tutor to the house of ribadouro  yet  contemporary documents  namely from the chancery of afonso in his early years as count of portucale  indicate according to jos   mattoso that the most likely tutor of afonso henriques was egas moniz s oldest brother  erm  gio moniz  who  besides being the senior brother within the family of ribadouro  became the  dapifer  and  majordomus  of afonso i from      until his death in       which indicates his closer proximity to the prince 

in an effort to pursue a larger share in the leonese inheritance  his mother teresa joined forces with fernando p  rez de trava  the most powerful count in galicia  the portuguese nobility disliked the alliance between galicia and portugal and rallied around afonso  the archbishop of braga was also concerned with the dominance of galicia  apprehensive of the ecclesiastical pretensions of his new rival the galician archbishop of santiago de compostela  diego gelm  rez  who had claimed an alleged discovery of relics of saint james in his town  as a way to gain power and riches over the other cathedrals in the iberian peninsula  in       afonso turned fourteen  the adult age in the   th century  in symmetry with his cousin he made himself a knight on his own account in the cathedral of zamora in       with the permission of his mother  after the military campaign of alfonso vii against his mother in       afonso revolted against her and proceeded to take control of the county from its queen 

in       near guimar  es at the battle of s  o mamede  afonso and his supporters overcame troops under both his mother and her lover  count fernando peres de trava of galicia  afonso exiled his mother to galicia  and took over rule of the county of portucale  thus the possibility of re incorporating portucale into a kingdom of portugal and galicia as before was eliminated and afonso became sole ruler following demands for greater independence from the county s church and nobles  the battle was mostly ignored by the leonese suzerain who was occupied at the time with a revolt in castille  he was also  most likely  waiting for the reaction of the galician families  after teresa s death in       afonso vii of le  n and castille proceeded to demand vassalage from his cousin  on   april       afonso henriques dictated the writ in which he proclaimed himself prince of portugal or prince of the portuguese  an act informally allowed by afonso vii  as it was thought to be afonso henriques s right by blood  as one of two grandsons of the emperor of hispania 

afonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the moors in the south  his campaigns were successful and  on    july       he obtained an overwhelming victory in the battle of ourique  and straight after was  possibly unanimously  proclaimed king of the portuguese by his soldiers  establishing his equality in rank to the other realms of the peninsula  although the first reference to his royal title dates from       the first assembly of the portuguese cortes convened at lamego  wherein he would have been given the crown from the archbishop of braga  to confirm his independence  is a   th century embellishment of portuguese history 

complete independence from alfonso vii of le  n s suzerainty  however  was not a thing he just could achieve militarily  the county of portugal still had to be acknowledged diplomatically by the neighboring lands as a kingdom and  most importantly  by the roman catholic church and the pope  afonso wed mafalda of savoy  daughter of amadeus iii  count of savoy  and sent ambassadors to rome to negotiate with the pope  he succeeded in renouncing the suzerainty of his cousin  alfonso vii of le  n  becoming instead a vassal of the papacy  as the kings of sicily and aragon had done before him  

in portugal he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders  he is notably the builder of alcoba  a monastery  to which he called the cistercian order of his uncle bernard of clairvaux of burgundy  in       he wrote to pope innocent ii to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the church  swearing to pursue driving the moors out of the iberian peninsula  bypassing any king of le  n  afonso declared himself the direct liege man of the papacy  afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the moors  from whom he wrested santar  m  see conquest of santar  m  and lisbon in       see siege of lisbon   he also conquered an important part of the land south of the tagus river  although this was lost again to the moors in the following years 

meanwhile  king alfonso vii of le  n  afonso s cousin  regarded the independent ruler of portugal as nothing but a rebel  conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years  afonso became involved in a war  taking the side of the aragonese king  an enemy of castile  to ensure the alliance  his son sancho was engaged to dulce  sister of the count of barcelona and infanta of aragon  finally after winning the battle of valdevez  the treaty of zamora        established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the kingdom of le  n that portugal was a sovereign kingdom 

in      the now old dom afonso was possibly disabled in an engagement near badajoz by a fall from his horse  and made prisoner by the soldiers of the king of le  n fernando ii also his son in law  from this time onward  the portuguese king never rode a horse again  but it is not certain this was because of the disability  according to the later portuguese chronistic tradition  this happened because afonso would have to surrender himself again to fernando ii of le  n or risk war between the two kingdoms if he rode a horse  portugal was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests afonso had made in galicia  north of the minho river  in the previous years 
in      the privileges and favours given to the roman catholic church were compensated  with consistent effort by several parties  such as the primate archpishop of braga paio mendes  in the papal court  the papal bull  manifestis probatum  was promulgated accepting the new king as vassal to the pope exclusively  in it pope alexander iii also acknowledged afonso as king and portugal as an independent crown with the right to conquer lands from the moors  with this papal blessing  portugal was at last secured as a kingdom 

in       the almohad caliph abu yaqub yusuf rallied a great almohad force to retaliate against the portuguese raids done since the end of a five year truce in      and besieged santar  m  which was defended by the heir sancho  the almohad siege failed when news arrived the archbishop of compostela had come to the defense of the city and fernando ii of le  n himself with his army  the almohads ended the siege and their retreat turned into a rout due to panic in their camp  with the almohad caliph being injured in the process  according to one version  because of a crossbow bolt  and dying on the way back to seville  afonso died shortly after  probably out of a sudden cause of death  on   december       the portuguese revere him as a hero  both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their nation  there are mythical stories that it took    men to carry his sword  and that afonso wanted to engage other monarchs in personal combat  but no one would dare accept his challenge  it is also told  despite his honourable character  that he had a temper  several chronicles give the example of a papal legate that brought a message from the pope paschal ii refusing to acknowledge afonso s claim as king  either after committing or saying a small offense against him or after being simply read the letter  afonso almost killed  in his rage  the papal representative  taking several portucalense nobles and soldiers to physically restrain the young would be king 

in july       the tomb of the king  which is located in the santa cruz monastery in coimbra  was to be opened for scientific purposes by researchers from the university of coimbra  portugal  and the university of granada  spain   the opening of the tomb provoked considerable concern among some sectors of portuguese society and portuguese state agency for architectural patrimony   instituto portugu  s do patrim  nio arquitect  nico    ippar  halted the opening  requesting more protocols from the scientific team because of the importance of the king in the nation s heart and public thought 

these are the known ancestors of afonso henriques  going back five generations 

in       afonso married mafalda  daughter of amadeus iii  count of savoy and mahaut of albon  both appearing together for the first time in may of that year confirming royal charters  they had the following issue 


before his marriage to mafalda  king afonso fathered his first son with chamoa g  mez  daughter of count g  mez n    ez and elvira p  rez  sister of fernando and bermudo p  rez de traba 


the extramarital offspring by elvira g  lter were 

king afonso was also the father of 






afonso ii of portugal

afonso ii    english   alphonzo    or  affonso   archaic portuguese    alfonso  or  alphonso   portuguese galician  or  alphonsus   latin version   nicknamed the fat  portuguese  o gordo    king of portugal  was born in coimbra on    april      and died on    march      in the same city  he was the second but eldest surviving son of sancho i of portugal by his wife  dulce   infanta  of aragon  afonso succeeded his father on    march      

as a king  afonso ii set a different approach of government  hitherto  his father sancho i and his grandfather afonso i were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring kingdom of castile or against the moorish lands in the south  afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to ensure peace with castile during his reign  despite this  some towns  like alc  cer do sal in       were conquered from the moors by the private initiative of noblemen  this does not mean that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man  the first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between afonso and his brothers and sisters  the king managed to keep security within portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin 

since military issues were not a government priority  afonso established the state s administration and centralized power on himself  he designed the first set of portuguese written laws  these were mainly concerned with private property  civil justice  and minting  afonso also sent ambassadors to european kingdoms outside the iberian peninsula and began amicable commercial relations with most of them 

other reforms included the always delicate matters with the pope  in order to get the independence of portugal recognized by rome  his grandfather  afonso i  had to legislate an enormous number of privileges to the church  these eventually created a state within the state  with portugal s position as a country firmly established  afonso ii endeavoured to weaken the power of the clergy and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the roman catholic church to purposes of national utility  these actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the pope and portugal  after being excommunicated for his audacities by pope honorius iii  afonso ii promised to make amends to the church  but he died in coimbra on    march      before making any serious attempts to do so 

king afonso was buried originally at the monastery of santa cruz in coimbra where his body remained for nearly ten years  his remains were transferred subsequently to alcoba  a monastery  as he had stipulated in his will  he and his wife  queen urraca  were buried at its royal pantheon 

in       he married his fourth cousin infanta urraca of castile  daughter of alfonso viii of castile and eleanor of england  both being descendants of king alfonso vi of le  n  the offspring of this marriage were 


out of wedlock  he had two illegitimate sons 





afonso iii of portugal

afonso iii    rare english alternatives   alphonzo  or  alphonse    or  affonso   archaic portuguese    alfonso  or  alphonso   portuguese galician  or  alphonsus   latin   the boulonnais  port   o bolonh  s    king of portugal    may        february       was the first to use the title  king of portugal and the algarve   from       he was the second son of king afonso ii of portugal and his wife  urraca of castile  he succeeded his brother  king sancho ii of portugal  who died on   january      

afonso was born in coimbra  as the second son of king afonso ii of portugal  he was not expected to inherit the throne  which was destined to go to his elder brother sancho 

he lived mostly in france  where he married matilda  the heiress of boulogne  in       thereby becoming count of boulogne  mortain  aumale and dammartin en go  le  jure uxoris  

in       conflicts between his brother  the king  and the church became unbearable  in       pope innocent iv ordered sancho ii to be removed from the throne and to be replaced by the count of boulogne  afonso  of course  did not refuse the papal order and consequently marched to portugal  since sancho was not a popular king the order was not hard to enforce  and he fled in exile to toledo  castile  where he died on   january       until his brother s death and his own eventual coronation  afonso retained and used the title of  visitador  curador e defensor do reino   overseer  curator and defender of the kingdom  

in order to ascend the throne afonso abdicated his rights to the county of boulogne in       in       he divorced matilde in order to marry beatrice of castile  illegitimate daughter of alfonso x  king of castile  and mayor guill  n de guzm  n 

determined not to make the same mistakes as his brother  afonso iii paid special attention to what the middle class  composed of merchants and small land owners  had to say  in       in the city of leiria  he held the first session of the  cortes   a general assembly comprising the nobility  the middle class and representatives of all municipalities  he also made laws intended to restrain the upper classes from abusing the least favored part of the population  remembered as a notable administrator  afonso iii founded several towns  granted the title of city to many others and reorganized public administration 

afonso showed extraordinary vision for the time  progressive measures taken during his kingship include  representatives of the commons  besides the nobility and clergy  were involved in governance  the end of preventive arrests such that henceforward all arrests had to be first presented to a judge to determine the detention measure  and fiscal innovation  such as negotiating extraordinary taxes with the mercantile classes and direct taxation of the church  rather than debasement of the coinage  these may have led to his excommunication by the holy see and possibly precipitated his death  and his son denis s premature rise to the throne at only    years old 

secure on the throne  afonso iii then proceeded to make war with the muslim communities that still thrived in the south  in his reign the algarve became part of the kingdom  following the capture of faro 

following his success against the moors  afonso iii had to deal with a political situation concerning the country s borders with castile  the neighbouring kingdom considered that the newly acquired lands of the algarve should be castilian  not portuguese  which led to a series of wars between the two kingdoms  finally  in       the treaty of badajoz        was signed in badajoz  determining that the southern border between castile and portugal should be the river guadiana  as it is today 

afonso died in alcoba  a  coimbra or lisbon  aged

afonso v of portugal

afonso v        january             august        called the african     was king of portugal and of the algarves  his sobriquet refers to his conquests in northern africa 

as of       afonso v was the first king of portugal to claim dominion over a plural  kingdom of the algarves   instead of the singular  kingdom of the algarve   territories added to the portuguese crown lands in north africa during the   th century came to be referred to as possessions of the kingdom of the algarve  now a region of southern portugal   not the kingdom of portugal  the  algarves  then were considered to be the southern portuguese territories on both sides of the strait of gibraltar 

afonso was born in sintra  the second son of king edward of portugal by his wife eleanor of aragon  following the death of his older brother  infante jo  o              afonso acceded to the position of heir apparent and was made the first prince of portugal by his father  who sought to emulate the english court s custom of a dynastic title that distinguished the heir apparent from the other children of the monarch  he was only six years old when he succeeded his father in      

during his minority  afonso v was placed under the regency of his mother in accordance with a will of his late father  as both a foreigner and a woman  the queen was not a popular choice for regent  opposition rose and without any important ally among the portuguese aristocracy other than afonso  count of barcelos  the illegitimate half brother of king edward  the queen s position was untenable  in       the portuguese cortes  assembly of the kingdom  decided to replace the queen with peter  duke of coimbra  dom pedro   the young king s oldest uncle 

peter s main policies were concerned with restricting the political power of the great noble houses and expanding the powers of the crown  the country prospered under his rule  but not peacefully  as his laws interfered with the ambition of powerful nobles  the count of barcelos  a personal enemy of the duke of coimbra  despite being half brothers  eventually became the king s favourite uncle and began a constant struggle for power  in       the king made afonso the first duke of braganza  with this title and its lands  he became the most powerful man in portugal and one of the richest men in europe  to secure his position as regent  peter had afonso marry his daughter  isabella of coimbra  in      

but on   june       when the king came of age  peter had to surrender his power to afonso v  the years of conspiracy by the duke of braganza finally came to a head  on    september of the same year  afonso v nullified all the laws and edicts approved under the regency  in the following year  led by what were later discovered to be false accusations  afonso declared peter a rebel and defeated his army in the battle of alfarrobeira  in which his uncle  and father in law  was killed  after this battle and the loss of one of portugal s most remarkable infantes  the duke of braganza became the  de facto  ruler of the country 

afonso v then turned his attentions to north africa  in the reign of his grandfather john i  ceuta had been conquered from the king of morocco  and now the new king wanted to expand the conquests  the king s army conquered alc  cer ceguer in      and arzila in       tangiers  on the other hand  was won and lost several times between      and       these achievements granted the king the nickname of  the african  or  africano   the king also supported the exploration of the atlantic ocean led by prince henry the navigator but after henry s death in       he did nothing to continue henry s work  administratively  afonso v was a passive king  he chose not to pursue the revision of laws or development of commerce  preferring instead to preserve the legacy of his father edward and grandfather john i 

in       pope nicholas v issued the papal bull  dum diversas   which granted afonso v the right to reduce  saracens  pagans and any other unbelievers  to hereditary slavery  this was reaffirmed and extended in the romanus pontifex bull of       also by nicholas v   these papal bulls came to be seen by some as a justification for the subsequent era of slave trade and european colonialism 

when the campaigns in africa were over  afonso v found new grounds for battle in neighboring castile  on december          king henry iv of castile died without a male heir  leaving just one daughter  joanna la beltraneja  however  her paternity was questioned  it was rumored that his wife  queen joan of portugal had an affair with a nobleman named beltr  n de la cueva  the death of henry ignited a war of succession with one faction supporting joanna and the other supporting isabella  henry s half sister  afonso v was persuaded to intervene on behalf of joanna  his niece  he betrothed himself to her  proclaimed himself king of castile and led troops into the kingdom  because of their close blood relationship  a formal marriage had to wait for papal dispensation 

on may          afonso and his son  prince jo  o  entered castile with an army of       cavalry and        foot soldiers  in march        after several skirmishes and much maneuvering  afonso faced a major castilian force at the battle of toro  castile was led by isabella s husband  prince ferdinand of aragon  the fighting was bloody with over       casualties for the portuguese  the battle ended with afonso s retreat  leaving castile holding the field  afterwards both sides claimed victory but afonso s prospects for obtaining the castilian crown were severely damaged 

after the battle  afonso sailed to france hoping to obtain the assistance of king louis xi in his fight against castile  but finding himself deceived by the french monarch  he returned to portugal in       disillusioned  he abdicated for a few days in november      in favor of his son john ii  then after returning to the throne  he retired to a monastery in sintra  where he died in      

afonso married firstly  in       with isabella of coimbra  with whom he had three children  


afonso married secondly  in       with joanna of castile  known as  la beltraneja

alphonso i of spain

several precursor kingdoms have had an alfonso i  you may be looking for 




alfonso ii of asturias

alfonso ii of asturias        nicknamed the chaste     was the king of asturias during two different periods  first in the year     and later from     until his death in      upon his death  nepociano  a family member of undetermined relation  attempted to usurp the crown in place of the future ramiro i 

during his reign  which covered a span of    years  alfonso discovered the supposed tomb of apostle santiago in the town of compostela  which later became known as the city of santiago de compostela 

he was the son of fruela i and the basque munia 

he was born in oviedo in     or      he was put under the guardianship of his aunt adosinda after his father s death  but one tradition relates his being put in the monastery of samos  he was the governor of the palace during the reign of adosinda s husband silo  on silo s death  he was elected king by adosinda s allies  but the magnates raised his uncle mauregatus to the throne instead  alfonso fled to   lava where he found shelter with his maternal relatives  mauregatus was succeeded by bermudo  alfonso s cousin  who abdicated after his defeat at the battle of the burbia river 

alfonso was subsequently elected king on september          poets of a later generation invented the story of the secret marriage between his sister ximena and sancho  count of saldana  and the feats of their son bernardo del carpio  bernardo is the hero of a  cantar de gesta    chanson de geste   written to please the anarchical spirit of the nobles 

on accession to the throne  hisham i  son of abd al rahman i  commenced a string of military campaigns in the eastern pyrenees and to the north west  in      a raid spearheaded by abd al karim dealt a major military blow to alfonso ii on the eastern fringes of the kingdom of asturias  cantabria and castile   the asturian king asked for the assistance of the basque frankish vassal belasco  master of   lava and bordering regions at the time  abd al karim advanced deeper west into asturias and pillaged the region  while his brother abd al malik ventured into the western asturian lands 

confronted with heavy fire  alfonso ii reached out to charlemagne s franks  he sent delegations to toulouse and aix la chapelle in           and      these diplomacy efforts may have aimed to strengthen his legitimacy and the government structures of asturias against ongoing internal unrest      troubles in galicia      and external attacks of the ibn mugait brothers  i e  generals abd al karim and abd al malik 

alfonso was acknowledged as a king by charlemagne and the pope  and asturias as a kingdom for the first time  the king showed an interest in the frankish cult of saint martin of tours  and most notably he encouraged carolingian church influence into asturias  also during alfonso s reign was the alleged resting place of st  james revealed  alfonso s envoys to charlemagne s courts may have also dealt with the adoptionist controversy  which had brought bermudo s kingdom into charlemagne s view  it seems that carolingian support did much to spur his military raid into andalusian territory up to lisbon  the andalusian city in turn was captured and sacked by his troops in     

in     he defeated cordovan forces at nar  n and anceo       and  thanks to these victories  the  repopulation  of parts of galicia  le  n  and castile was started   charter granting that confirmed the possession of the territories 

alfonso also moved the capital from pravia  where silo had located it  to oviedo  the city of his father s founding and his birth  there he constructed churches and a palace  he built san tirso  where he is buried  and santullano  on the outskirts  the  cr  nica sebastianense  records his death in      saying 

tradition relates that in      the body of saint james the greater was discovered in compostela and that alfonso was the first pilgrim to that famous medieval  and modern  shrine

alfonso xii of spain

alfonso xii  alfonso francisco de as  s fernando p  o juan mar  a de la concepci  n gregorio pelayo     november        november       was king of spain  reigning from      to       after a revolution deposed his mother isabella ii from the throne in       alfonso studied in austria and france  his mother abdicated in his favour in       and he returned to spain as king in      following a military coup against the first republic  alfonso died aged    in       and was succeeded by his unborn son  who became alfonso xiii on his birth the following year 

to date  he is the last monarch of spain who died whilst on the throne 

alfonso was born in madrid as the eldest son of queen isabella ii  officially  his father was her husband  infante francis  alfonso s biological paternity is uncertain  there is speculation that his biological father may have been enrique puigmolt   y mayans  a captain of the guard   these rumours were used as political propaganda against alfonso by the carlists 

his mother s accession created the second cause of instability  which was the carlist wars  the supporters of the count of molina as king of spain rose to have him enthroned  in addition  within the context of the post napoleonic restorations and revolutions which engulfed the west both in europe and the americas  both the carlistas as well as the isabelino conservatives were opposed to the new napoleonic constitutional system  much like in britain  which subtracted itself from the liberal constitutional process  spanish conservatives wanted to continue with the traditional spanish organic laws such as the fuero juzgo  the nov  sima recopilaci  n and the partidas of alfonso x  this led to the third cause of instability of note  the  independence of the american kingdoms   recognized between      and      

when queen isabella and her husband were forced to leave spain by the revolution of       alfonso accompanied them to paris  from there  he was sent to the theresianum at vienna to continue his studies  on    june       he was recalled to paris  where his mother abdicated in his favour  in the presence of a number of spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to that of the exiled queen  he assumed the name alfonso xii  for although no king of united spain had borne the name  alfonso xi   the spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy represented by the    kings of asturias  le  n and castile also named alfonso 

after amadeo s abandonment in       parliament declared the federal republic  including cuba  puerto rico and the pacific archipelagos   the first act of president estanislao figueras was to extend the abolition act to puerto rico  cuban slaves would have to wait until      

but the republicans were not in agreement either  and they had to contend with the war in cuba  and muslim uprisings in spanish morocco  in the midst of the crisis during and after the first spanish republic  the carlist party made itself strong in areas with claims over their national and institutional specificity  such as catalonia or the basque districts  by       the third carlist war erupted  this unrest led to the creation of a group in favor of the bourbon restoration  made by some sectors of the conservatives led by canovas del castillo 

the prince of asturias  alfonso  was the person chosen to develop the new road map proposed by canovas  which led to the june      abdication of queen isabel ii in favour of her son prince alfonso  the new road map  which indeed ended the eternal crisis begun in      was called  alfonsismo   and the moderate centrist c  novas del castillo became the spokesman  as having alfonso in spain would be a problem  c  novas became responsible for his education  he sent alfonso to the royal military college  sandhurst  in england  where the training alfonso received was severe but more cosmopolitan than in spain  given the current atmosphere 

on   december       alfonso issued the sandhurst manifesto  where he set the ideological basis of the bourbon restoration  it was drafted in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers  a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the spanish monarchy  at the end of       brigadier mart  nez campos  who had long been working more or less openly for the king  led some battalions of the central army to sagunto  rallied to his own flag the troops sent against him  and entered valencia in the king s name  thereupon the president resigned  and his power was transferred to the king s plenipotentiary and adviser  antonio c  novas  the    december      military coup of gen  martinez campos in sagunto ended the failed republic and meant the rise of the young prince alfonso 

within a few days after canovas del castillo took power as premier  the new king  proclaimed on    december       arrived at madrid  passing through barcelona and valencia and was acclaimed everywhere         in       a vigorous campaign against the carlists  in which the young king took part  resulted in the defeat of don carlos and the duke s abandonment of the struggle 

initially led by canovas del castillo as moderate prime minister  what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the political administrative positions of power  in reality ushered in a civilian regime that lasted until primo de rivera s      coup d   tat  c  novas was the real architect of the new regime of the restoration 

in order to eliminate one of the problems of the reign of isabel ii  the single party and its destabilizing consequences  the liberal party was allowed to incorporate and participate in national politics  and the  turnismo  or alternation was to become the new system  turnismo would be endorsed in the constitution of      and the pact of pardo palace         it meant that liberal and conservative prime ministers would succeed each other ending thus the troubles 

this led to the end of the carlist revolts and the victory over the new york backed cuban revolutionaries  and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular spaniards of alfonso as a wise and able king 

alfonso s short reign established the foundations for the final socioeconomic recuperation of spain after the             crisis  both european  the coastal regions  such as the basque country  catalonia  and asturias  and overseas     antilles and pacific were able to grow steadily  cuba and puerto rico prospered to the point that spain s first train was between havana and camag  ey  and the first telegraph in latin america was in puerto rico  established by samuel morse  whose daughter lived there with her husband  upon the american invasion of puerto rico  ten us dollars were needed to buy one puerto rican peso 

on    january      at the basilica of atocha in madrid  alfonso married his first cousin  princess maria de las mercedes  daughter of antoine  duke of montpensier  but she died within six months of the marriage 

on    november      at the basilica of atocha in madrid  alfonso married a much more distant relative  maria christina of austria  daughter of archduke karl ferdinand and archduchess elisabeth of austria  during the honeymoon  a pastry cook named otero fired at the young sovereign and his wife as they were driving in madrid 

the children of this marriage were 

alfonso had two sons by elena armanda nicolasa sanz y mart  nez de arizala  castell  n de la plana     december     paris     december       

in      alfonso refused to sanction a law by which the ministers were to remain in office for a fixed term of    months  upon the consequent resignation of canovas del castillo  he summoned pr  xedes mateo sagasta  the liberal leader  to form a new cabinet 

in november       alfonso died  just short of his   th birthday  at the royal palace of el pardo near madrid  he had been suffering from tuberculosis  but the immediate cause of his death was a recurrence of dysentery 

in       his widow maria cristina initiated a national contest to build a monument in memory of alfonso  the winning design  by jos   grases riera  was erected in an artificial lake in madrid s parque del buen retiro in      

coming to the throne at such an early age alfonso had served no apprenticeship in the art of ruling  benevolent and sympathetic in disposition  he won the affection of his people by fearlessly visiting districts ravaged by cholera or devastated by earthquake in       his capacity for dealing with men was considerable  and he never allowed himself to become the instrument of any particular party  during his short reign  peace was established both at home and abroad  finances were well regulated  and the various administrative services were placed on a basis that afterwards enabled spain to pass through the disastrous war with the united states without the threat of a revolution

by       alfonso was looking for a suitable consort  on a state visit to the united kingdom  he stayed at buckingham palace with king edward vii  there he met princess victoria eugenie of battenberg  the scottish born daughter of edward s youngest sister princess beatrice  and a granddaughter of queen victoria  he found her attractive  and she returned his interest  there were obstacles to the marriage  victoria was a protestant  and would have to become a catholic  victoria s brother leopold was a haemophiliac  so there was a    percent chance that victoria was a carrier of the trait  finally  alfonso s mother maria christina wanted him to marry a member of her family  the house of habsburg lorraine or some other catholic princess  as she considered the battenbergs to be non dynastic 

victoria was willing to change her religion  and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility  maria christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition  in january      she wrote an official letter to princess beatrice proposing the match  victoria met maria christina and alfonso in biarritz  france  later that month  and converted to catholicism in san sebasti  n in march 
in may  diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage  alfonso and victoria were married at the royal monastery of san jer  nimo in madrid on    may       with british royalty in attendance  including victoria s cousins the prince and princess of wales  later king george v and queen mary   the wedding was marked by an assassination attempt on alfonso and victoria by catalan anarchist mateu morral  as the wedding procession returned to the palace  he threw a bomb from a window which killed or injured several bystanders and members of the procession 

on    may       the couple s first child  alfonso  prince of asturias  was born  however  victoria was in fact a haemophilia carrier  and alfonso inherited the condition 

neither of the two daughters born to the king and queen were haemophilia carriers  but another of their sons  gonzalo                had the condition  alfonso distanced himself from his queen for transmitting the condition to their sons 

from      on  he had several mistresses  and fathered five illegitimate children  a sixth illegitimate child had been born before his marriage 

during world war i  because of his family connections with both sides and the division of popular opinion  spain remained neutral  the king established an office for assistance to prisoners of war on all sides  this office used the spanish diplomatic and military network abroad to intercede for thousands of pows     transmitting and receiving letters for them  and other services  the office was located in the royal palace 

alfonso became gravely ill during the      flu pandemic  spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions  so his illness and subsequent recovery were reported to the world  while flu outbreaks in the belligerent countries were concealed  this gave the misleading impression that spain was the most affected area and led to the pandemic being dubbed  the spanish flu  

following world war i  spain entered the lengthy yet victorious rif war               to preserve its colonial rule over northern morocco  critics of the monarchy thought the war was an unforgivable loss of money and lives  and nicknamed alfonso  el africano    the african    alfonso had not acted as a strict constitutional monarch  and supported the africanists who wanted to conquer for spain a new empire in africa to compensate for the lost empire in the americas and asia  the rif war had starkly polarized spanish society between the africanists who wanted to conquer an empire in africa vs  the  abandonistas  who wanted to abandon morocco as not worth the blood and treasure  alfonso liked to play favourites with his generals  and one of his most favored generals was manuel fern  ndez silvestre  in       when silvestre advanced up into the rif mountains of morocco  alfonso sent him a telegram whose first line read  hurrah for real men    urging silvestre not to retreat at a time when silvestre was experiencing major difficulties  silvestre stayed the course  leading his men into the battle of annual  one of spain s worst defeats  alfonso  who was on holiday in the south of france at the time  was informed of the  disaster of the annual  while he was playing golf  reportedly  alfonso s response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say  chicken meat is cheap   before resuming his game of golf  alfonso remained in france and did not return to spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost at the  disaster of the annual   which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act  a sign that the king couldn t care less about the lives of his soldiers  in       the  cortes  started an investigation into the responsibility for the annual disaster and soon discovered evidence that the king had been one of the main supporters of silvestre s advance into the rif mountains 

after the  disaster of the annual   spain s war in the rif went from bad to worse  and as the spanish were barely hanging onto morocco  support for the  abandonistas  grew as many people could see no point to the war  in august       spanish soldiers embarking for morocco mutinied  other soldiers in malaga simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to morocco  while in barcelona huge crowds of left wingers had staged anti war protests at which spanish flags were burned while the flag of the rif republic was waved about  with the africanists comprising only a minority  it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the  abandonistas  forced the spanish to give up on the rif  which was part of the reason for the military coup d   tat later in       on september           general miguel primo de rivera  seized power in a military coup  he ruled as a dictator with alfonso s support until       it is believed that one of alfonso s main reasons for supporting the coup was his desire to suppress the publication of the damning  cortes  report into the annual disaster  the poetic generation of     as well as catalan and basque nationalism grew in this era 

in january       due to economic problems and general unpopularity  miguel primo de rivera resigned as prime minister  alfonso  as the prime minister s ally  shared the popular dislike  the king had so closely associated with the primo de rivera dictatorship that it was difficult for him to distance himself from the regime he had supported for almost   years  in april       general jos   sanjurjo told him even the army was not loyal  on    april  the republican parties won a landslide victory in municipal elections  the municipal elections were fought as a virtual referendum on the future of the monarchy  alfonso fled the country on    april as the second spanish republic was proclaimed  but did not formally abdicate  he eventually settled in rome 

by a law of    november       alfonso was accused by the cortes of high treason  this law would later be repealed by a new law dated    december       signed by francisco franco 

in       his two eldest sons  alfonso and jaime  renounced their claims to the throne  and in      his youngest son gonzalo died  this left his third son juan  count of barcelona his only male heir  juan later was the father of juan carlos i 

when the army rose up against the democratically elected republican government  war broke out  alfonso made it clear he favoured the  nationalist  military rebels against the republic  but in september      the nationalist leader  general francisco franco  declared that the nationalists would not restore alfonso as king   the nationalist army included many carlist supporters of a rival pretender  

nevertheless  he sent his son juan to spain in       to participate in the uprising  however  general mola had juan arrested near the french border and expelled from the country 

on    september       upon the death of infante alfonso carlos  duke of san jaime  the carlist pretender   alfonso also became the senior heir of hugh capet and so was hailed by some french legitimists as king alphonse i of france and navarre 

on    january       alfonso xiii abdicated his rights to the defunct spanish throne in favour of juan  he died in rome on    february of that year 

in spain  the  caudillo  franco ordered three days of national mourning  his funeral was held in rome in the church of santa maria degli angeli e dei martiri  alfonso was buried in the church of santa maria in monserrato degli spagnoli  the spanish national church in rome  immediately below the tombs of pope callixtus iii and pope alexander vi  in january      his remains were transferred to el escorial in spain 

alfonso was a promoter of tourism in spain  the need for the lodging of his wedding guests prompted the construction of the luxury hotel palace in madrid  he also supported the creation of a network of state run lodges  parador  in historic buildings of spain  his fondness for the sport of football led to the patronage of several  royal    real  in spanish  football clubs  the first being real club deportivo de la coru  a in       selected others include real madrid  real sociedad  real betis  real uni  n  espanyol and real zaragoza 

an avenue in the northern madrid neighbourhood of chamart  n  avenida de alfonso xiii  is named after him  a plaza or town center in iloilo city  philippines  now plaza libertad  was named in his honour called plaza alfonso xiii  a street in merthyr tydfil  in wales  was built especially to house spanish immigrants in the mining industry and named alphonso street after alfonso xiii 

alfonso xiii appears as  king buby  in luis coloma s story of ratoncito p  rez         which was written for the king when he was   years old  the story of ratoncito p  rez has been adapted into further literary works and movies since then  with the character of alfonso xiii appearing in some  alfonso xiii is also mentioned on the plaque to ratoncito p  rez on the second floor of  la calle del arenal  

on    may       alfonso married scottish born princess victoria eugenie of battenberg                only entitled to the style of  serene highness  by birth  ena  as she was known  was granted the higher honorific of  royal highness  one month before her wedding 

alfonso and ena had six surviving children

alfonso the battler

alfonso i             september        called the battler or the warrior     was the king of aragon and pamplona from      until his death in       he was the second son of king sancho ram  rez and successor of his brother peter i  with his marriage to urraca  queen regnant of castile  le  n and galicia  in       he began to use  with some justification  the grandiose title emperor of spain  formerly employed by his father in law  alfonso vi  alfonso the battler earned his sobriquet in the reconquista  he won his greatest military successes in the middle ebro  where he conquered zaragoza in      and took ejea  tudela  calatayud  borja  tarazona  daroca  and monreal del campo  he died in september      after an unsuccessful battle with the muslims at the battle of fraga 

his nickname comes from the aragonese version of the  chronicle of san juan de la pe  a   c         which says that  they called him lord alfonso the battler because in spain there wasn t as good a knight who won twenty nine battles    clamabanlo don alfonso batallador porque en espayna no ovo tan buen cavallero que veynte nueve batallas ven  i     

his earliest years were passed in the monastery of siresa  learning to read and write and to practice the military arts under the tutelage of lope garc  s the pilgrim  who was repaid for his services by his former charge with the county of pedrola when alfonso came to the throne 

during his brother s reign  he participated in the taking of huesca  the battle of alcoraz         which became the largest city in the kingdom and the new capital  he also joined el cid s expeditions in valencia  his father gave him the lordships of biel  luna  ardenes  and bailo 

a series of deaths put alfonso directly in line for the throne  his brother s children  isabella and peter  who married mar  a rodr  guez  daughter of el cid   died in      and      respectively 

a passionate fighting man  he fought twenty nine battles against christian or moor   he was married  when well over    years and a habitual bachelor  in      to the ambitious queen urraca of le  n  widow of raymond of burgundy  a passionate woman unsuited for a subordinate role  the marriage had been arranged by her father alfonso vi of le  n in      to unite the two chief christian states against the almoravids  and to supply them with a capable military leader  but urraca was tenacious of her right as queen regnant and had not learnt chastity in the polygamous household of her father  husband and wife quarrelled with the brutality of the age and came to open war  even placing urraca under siege at astorga in       alfonso had the support of one section of the nobles who found their account in the confusion  being a much better soldier than any of his opponents he won the battle of candespina and the battle of viadangos  but his only trustworthy supporters were his aragonese  who were not numerous enough to keep castile and le  n subjugated  the marriage of alfonso and urraca was declared null by the pope  as they were second cousins  in       but he ignored the papal nuncio and clung to his liaison with urraca until       during his marriage  he had called himself  king and emperor of castile  toledo  arag  n  pamplona  sobrarbe  and ribagorza  in recognition of his rights as urraca s husband  of his inheritance of the lands of his father  including the kingdom of his great uncle gonzalo  and his prerogative to conquer andalusia from the muslims  he inserted the title of  imperator  on the basis that he had three kingdoms under his rule 

alfonso s late marriage and his failure to remarry and produce the essential legitimate heir that should have been a dynastic linchpin of his aggressive territorial policies have been adduced as a lack of interest in women  ibn al athir               describes alfonso as a tireless soldier who would sleep in his armor without benefit of cover  whom when asked why he did not take his pleasure from one of the captives of muslim chiefs  responded that the man devoted to war needs the companionship of men not women 

the king quarrelled with the church  and particularly the cistercians  almost as violently as with his wife  as he defeated her  so he drove archbishop bernard into exile and expelled the monks of sahag  n  he was finally compelled to give way in castile and le  n to his stepson  alfonso vii of castile  son of urraca and her first husband  the intervention of pope calixtus ii brought about an arrangement between the old man and his young namesake 

in      in belchite  he founded a confraternity of knights to fight against the almoravids  it was the start of the military orders in aragon  years later  he organised a branch of the  militia christi  of the holy land at monreal del campo 

alfonso spent his first four years as king in near constant war with the muslims  in       he conquered ejea and tauste and refortified castellar and juslibol  in       he defeated ahmad ii al musta in of zaragoza at valtierra  in       he took tamarite de litera and esteban de la litera  then followed a period dominated by his relations with castile and le  n through his wife  urraca  he resumed his conquest in      by conquering fitero  corella  cintru  nigo  murchante  monteagudo  and cascante 

in       the council of toulouse declared a crusade to assist in the conquest of zaragoza  many frenchmen consequently joined alfonso at ayerbe  they took almud  var  gurrea de g  llego  and zuera  besieging zaragoza itself by the end of may  the city fell on    december  and the forces of alfonso occupied the azuda  the government tower  the great palace of the city was given to the monks of bernard  promptly  the city was made alfonso s capital  two years later  in       he defeated a muslim army intent on reconquering his new capital at the battle of cutanda  he promulgated the  fuero  of  tortum per tortum   facilitating taking the law into one s own hands  which among others reassumed the muslim right to dwell in the city and their right to keep their properties and practice their religion under their own jurisdiction as long as they maintained tax payment and relocated to the suburbs 
in       he retook cervera  tudejen  castell  n  tarazona    greda  magall  n  borja  alag  n  novillas  mall  n  rueda    pila and populated the region of soria  he began the siege of calatayud  but left to defeat the army at cutanda trying to retake zaragoza  when calatayud fell  he took bubierca  alhama de arag  n  ariza  and daroca         in       he besieged and took lleida  which was in the hands of the count of barcelona  from the winter of      to september       he was on a risky expedition to pe  a cadiella deep in andalusia 

in the great raid of       he carried away a large part of the subject christians from granada  and in the south west of france  he had claims as usurper king of navarre  from      to       he was on campaign against granada  where he was trying to install a christian prince  and c  rdoba  where got only as far as motril  in       he reconquered longares  but simultaneously lost all his castilian possessions to alfonso vii  he confirmed a treaty with castile the next year        with the peace of t  mara  which fixed the boundaries of the two realms 

he conquered molina de arag  n and populated monz  n in       before besieging valencia  which had fallen again upon the cid s death 

he went north of the pyrenees in october      to protect the val d aran  early in       he besieged bayonne  it is said he ruled  from belorado to pallars and from bayonne to monreal  

at the siege of bayonne in october       three years before his death  he published a will leaving his kingdom to three autonomous religious orders based in palestine and politically largely independent   the knights templars  the hospitallers  and the knights of the holy sepulchre  whose influences might have been expected to cancel one another out  the will has greatly puzzled historians  who have read it as a bizarre gesture of extreme piety uncharacteristic of alfonso s character  one that effectively undid his life s work  elena lourie        suggested instead that it was alfonso s attempt to neutralize the papacy s interest in a disputed succession     aragon had been a fief of the papacy since          and to fend off urraca s son from her first marriage  alfonso vii of castile  for the papacy would be bound to press the terms of such a pious testament  generous bequests to important churches and abbeys in castile had the effect of making the noble churchmen there beneficiaries who would be encouraged by the will to act as a brake on alfonso vii s ambitions to break it     and yet among the magnates witnessing the will in      there is not a single cleric  in the event it was a will that his nobles refused to carry out     instead bringing his brother ramiro from the monastery to assume royal powers     an eventuality that lourie suggests was alfonso s hidden intent 

his final campaigns were against mequinenza        and fraga         where garc  a ram  rez  the future king of navarre  and a mere     other knights fought with him  it fell on    july  he was dead by september  his tomb is in the monastery of san pedro in huesca 

the testament of alfonso leaving his kingdom to the three orders was dismissed out of hand by the nobility of his kingdoms  and possible successors were sought  alfonso s only brother  ramiro  had been a benedictine monk since childhood  and his commitment to the church  his temperament and vow of celibacy made him ill suited to rule a kingdom under constant military threat and in need of a stable line of succession  the step son of the deceased king  alfonso vii of le  n  as reigning monarch and legitimate descendant of sancho iii of navarre  put himself forward but garnered no local support  the nobility of navarre aligned behind pedro de atar  s  the grandson of alfonso s illegitimate uncle  while the aragonese nobility rallied around the abbot bishop ramiro  a convention was called at borja to develop a consensus  but there peter so alienated his own partisans with perceived arrogance that they abandoned him  yet were unwilling to accept ramiro  the convention broke up without arriving at a compromise and the two regional factions then acted independently 

the choice of the navarrese lords fell on garc  a ram  rez  lord of monz  n  descendant of an illegitimate son of garc  a s  nchez iii and prot  g   of alfonso vii to be their king  the aragonese took ramiro out of a monastery and made him king  marrying him without papal dispensation to agnes  sister of the duke of aquitaine  then betrothing their newborn daughter to ramon berenguer iv  count of barcelona  who was then named ramiro s heir   the result of the crisis produced by the result of alfonso i s will was a major reorientation of the peninsula s kingdoms  the separation of aragon and navarre  the union of aragon and catalonia and     a moot point but stressed particularly by some castilian historians     the affirmation of  castilian hegemony  in spain  by the rendering of homage for zaragoza by alfonso s eventual heir  ramon berenguer iv of barcelona 

sometime during the reign of alfonso ii of aragon  the battler s grandnephew  a man came forward claiming to be alfonso the battler  the only contemporary references to this event are two letters of alfonso ii addressed to louis vii of france  they were carried to louis by berengar  the bishop of lleida  but are not dated  according to the second of these  the pretender was then living in louis s domains  meaning the principality of catalonia  which was ruled by alfonso under louis s suzerainty  this pretender was an old man  appropriately  since the battler had died some decades earlier  and alfonso ii expressed confidence that louis would arrest him at the earliest possible moment and bring him to justice  the first letter supplies sufficient information to date it approximately  since the bishop sojourned at the court of louis on his way to rome  it is known from other sources that berengar attended the third lateran council in march       the letters were probably written towards the end of      or in january      at the latest  according to an annalist source for the years              the pretender was received with honour and pomp in zaragoza  calatayud  and daroca  which the battler had conquered  but after it was found out that he was false he was executed before the city of barcelona in       modern historian antonio ubieto arteta has hypothesised that the aragonese lords of the tenencies of zaragoza  calatayud  and daroca     pedro de luesia  loferrench de luna  pedro de castillazuelo  lord of calatayud   pedro cornel  lord of murillo de g  llego   and the majordomo jimeno de artusilla  all of whom disappear between      and      in the documentation of their tenencies     supported  at least initially  the pretender  these lords also appear in the later legend of the bell of huesca  which has no historical basis  as the victims of ramiro ii         since  historically  they were not active in the     s  it is possible that the historically based legend of the pseudo alfonso had some influence on the genesis of the bell of huesca 

the earliest chronicle source for the imposture is rodrigo jim  nez de rada  writing in the middle of the thirteenth century  who records that there were several legends then current about the death of alfonso the battler  some believed he perished in the battle of fraga  some that his body had never been recovered  others that he was buried in the monastery of montearag  n  and still others that he had fled from fraga in shame after his defeat and became a pilgrim as an act of penance  some years later  rodrigo writes  though he does not give a year  an impostor arose and was received by many as the battler  though alfonso ii had him arrested and hanged  this is the earliest reference to the impostor s end  the legend was amplified in later years  according to the fourteenth century  cr  nica de los estados peninsulares   the battler went on a pilgrimage to jerusalem  where he lived for many years  the  cr  nica de san juan de la pe  a  also recounts the incident  but it depends entirely on rodrigo and the  estados peninsulares   it is not until the seventeenth century historian jer  nimo zurita penned his  anales de la corona de arag  n  that new details were added to the legend  zurita dates the impostor s appearance to the death of raymond berengar iv of barcelona  who had been exercising power in aragon  and the succession of the child alfonso ii in       the death of the impostor  by hanging  must have occurred in      





amaryllis

amaryllis    is the only genus in the subtribe amaryllidinae  tribe amaryllideae   it is a small genus of flowering bulbs  with two species  the better known of the two   amaryllis belladonna   is a native of the western cape region of south africa  particularly the rocky southwest area between the olifants river valley to knysna  for many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names  amaryllis  and  hippeastrum   one result of which is that the common name  amaryllis  is mainly used for cultivars of the genus  hippeastrum   widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors  plants of the genus  amaryllis  are known as belladonna lily  jersey lily  naked lady  amarillo  easter lily in southern australia or  in south africa  march lily due to its propensity to flower around march  this is one of numerous genera with the common name  lily  due to their flower shape and growth habit  however  they are only distantly related to the true lily   lilium   in the victorian language of flowers  see plant symbolism   amaryllis means  pride  

 amaryllis  is a bulbous plant  with each bulb being in diameter  it has several strap shaped  green leaves  long and broad  arranged in two rows 

each bulb produces one or two leafless stems          cm tall  each of which bears a cluster of two to twelve funnel shaped flowers at their tops  each flower is diameter with six tepals  three outer sepals  three inner petals  with similar appearance to each other   the usual color is white with crimson veins  but pink or purple also occur naturally 

the single genus in subtribe amaryllidinae  in the amaryllideae tribe  the taxonomy of the genus has been controversial  in      carl linnaeus created the name  amaryllis belladonna   the type species of the genus  amaryllis   at the time both south african and south american plants were placed in the same genus  subsequently they were separated into two different genera  the key question is whether linnaeus s type was a south african plant or a south american plant  if the latter   amaryllis  would be the correct name for the genus  hippeastrum   and a different name would have to be used for the genus discussed here  alan w  meerow et al  have briefly summarized the debate  which took place from      onwards and involved botanists on both sides of the atlantic  the outcome was a decision by the   th international botanical congress in      that  amaryllis  should be a conserved name  i e  correct regardless of priority  and ultimately based on a specimen of the south african  amaryllis belladonna  from the clifford herbarium at the natural history museum in london 

amaryllidinae are placed within amaryllideae as follow 

these are phylogenetically related as follows 

the name  amaryllis  is taken from a shepherdess in virgil s pastoral  eclogues    from the greek       meaning  to sparkle   and also from  amarella  for the bitterness of the bulb 

although the      decision settled the question of the scientific name of the genus  the common name  amaryllis  continues to be used differently  bulbs sold as amaryllis and described as  ready to bloom for the holidays  belong to the allied genus  hippeastrum   the common name  naked lady  used for  amaryllis  is also used for other bulbs with a similar growth and flowering pattern  some of these have their own widely used and accepted common names  such as the resurrection lily   lycoris squamigera    the common name  naked lady  comes from the plant s pattern of flowering when the foliage has died down 

in areas of its native habitat with mountainous fynbos flowering tends to be suppressed until after bush fires as dense overhead vegetation prevents growth  in more open sandy areas of the western cape  the plant flowers annually  plants tend to be very localized in dense concentrations due to the seeds  large size and heavy weight  strong winds shake loose the seeds  which fall to ground and immediately start to germinate  aided by the first winter rains 

the leaves are produced in the autumn or early spring in warm climates depending on the onset of rain and eventually die down by late spring  the bulb is then dormant until late summer  the plant is not frost tolerant  nor does it do well in tropical environments since they require a dry resting period between leaf growth and flower spike production 

one or two leafless stems arise from the bulb in the dry ground in late summer  march in its native habitat and august in usda zone    

the plant has a symbiotic relationship with carpenter bees  it is also visited by noctuid moths at night  the relative importance of these animals as pollinators has not yet been established  however  carpenter bees are thought to be the main pollinators of amaryllis on the cape peninsula  the plant s main parasite is the lily borer  brithys crini  and or  diaphone eumela  

 amaryllis belladonna  was introduced into cultivation at the beginning of the eighteenth century  it reproduces slowly by either bulb division or seeds and has gradually naturalized from plantings in urban and suburban areas throughout the lower elevations and coastal areas in much of the west coast of the usa since these environments mimic their native south african habitat  hardiness zones      it is also naturalized in australia 

there is an  amaryllis belladonna  hybrid which was bred in the     s in australia  no one knows the exact species it was crossed with to produce color variations of white  cream  peach  magenta and nearly red hues  the hybrids were crossed back onto the original  amaryllis belladonna  and with each other to produce naturally seed bearing crosses that come in a very wide range of flower sizes  shapes  stem heights and intensities of pink  pure white varieties with bright green stems were bred as well  the hybrids are quite distinct in that the many shades of pink also have stripes  veining  darkened edges  white centers and light yellow centers  also setting them apart from the original light pink  in addition  the hybrids often produce flowers in a fuller circle rather than the  side facing  habit of the  old fashioned  pink  the hybrids are able to adapt to year round watering and fertilization but can also tolerate completely dry summer conditions if need be 

 a   belladonna  has gained the royal horticultural society s award of garden merit 

 amaryllis belladonna  has been crossed in cultivation with  crinum moorei  to produce a hybrid called      amarcrinum   which has named cultivars  hybrids said to be between  amaryllis belladonna  and  brunsvigia josephinae  have been called      amarygia   neither hybrid genus name is accepted by the  world checklist of selected plant families  





alfonso iii of aragon

alfonso iii    november       in valencia        june        called the liberal   el liberal   or the free  also  the frank   from  el franc    was the king of aragon and count of barcelona  as alfons ii  from       he conquered the kingdom of majorca between his succession and      

he was a son of king peter iii of aragon and constance  daughter and heiress of king manfred of sicily 

soon after assuming the throne  he conducted a campaign to reincorporate the balearic islands into the kingdom of aragon   which had been lost due to the division of the kingdom by his grandfather  james i of aragon  thus in      he declared war on his uncle  james ii of majorca  and conquered both majorca        and ibiza         effectively reassuming suzerainty over the kingdom of majorca  he followed this with the conquest of menorca   until then  an autonomous muslim state  man  rqa  within the kingdom of majorca   on    january       the anniversary of which now serves as menorca s national holiday 

he initially sought to maintain aragonese control over sicily early in his reign by supporting the claims to the island of his brother  james ii of aragon  however  he later retracted the support for his brother shortly before his death and instead tried to make peace with the papal states france 

his reign was marred by a constitutional struggle with the aragonese nobles  which eventually culminated in the articles of the union of aragon   the so called  magna carta of aragon   which devolved several key royal powers into the hands of lesser nobles  his inability to resist the demands of his nobles was to leave a heritage of disunity in aragon and further dissent amongst the nobility  who increasingly saw little reason to respect the throne  and brought the kingdom of aragon close to anarchy 

during his lifetime a dynastic marriage with eleanor  daughter of king edward i of england  was arranged  however alfonso died before meeting his bride  he died at the age of    in       and was buried in the franciscan convent in barcelona  since      his remains have been buried in barcelona cathedral 

dante alighieri  in the divine comedy  recounts that he saw alfonso s spirit seated outside the gates of purgatory with the other monarchs whom dante blamed for the chaotic political state of europe during the   th century 





alfonso iv of aragon

alfonso iv  called the kind  also  the gentle  or  the nice        november             january       was the king of aragon and count of barcelona  as alfonso iii  from      to his death  his reign saw the incorporation of the county of urgell  duchy of athens  and duchy of neopatria into the crown of aragon 

alfonso was born in naples  the second son of james ii and blanche of anjou  in       aged     he married teresa d enten  a y cabrera  heiress of urgell  who was the same age as him  teresa s granduncle ermengol x of urgell had died childless in la llitera  before his death  he had agreed to make alfonso his heir  on condition that alfonso would marry teresa  who was his nearest kin  alfonso was at this time only the second son  and not the heir  of the king of aragon  he and his father readily agreed to ermengol s condition  and alfonso married teresa in      in the cathedral of lerida  the teenage bridegroom is reputed to have been so liberal in the expenses during the wedding  that the local counsels imposed restrictions on how much he could spend  alfonso and teresa became the parents of seven children 

alfonso became heir to the throne in december      after his older brother james renounced his rights to become a monk  during the reign of his father  alfonso was the procurator general of the crown  and in              he undertook the conquest of sardinia 

alfonso s father and first wife teresa died within a few days of each other in       teresa died in childbirth on    october       and james ii died on   november       whereupon alfonso became king  in       he began a long war with the republic of genoa  the city of sassari ahd previously surrendered to alfonso in       but rebelled three more times  its possession was contested by genoa  which led to the protracted war 

in february       alfonso married eleanor of castile                the sister of king alfonso xi of castile  eleanor had been briefly married to alfonso s elder brother james the monk  that marriage  which james had refused to consummate  had been annulled in          eleanor had thereafter retired to a convent  although she never took the veil  and had remained unmarried  by december the same year  the couple were rejoiced to become the parents of a son  ferdinand  who was followed five years later by another son  john 

eleanor earnestly sought to advance the interests of her own infant sons over those of her stepson  the  infante  peter  who was the heir apparent  she convinced her husband to grant very large and significant territories to her sons  on    december       alfonso granted his new born son ferdinand the marquisate of tortosa and the cities of albarrac  n  orihuela  callosa d en sarri    guardamar  alicante  monforte  elda  la mola  novelda and aspe  eleanor s younger son john  who was born five years later  was also granted several lordships when he was only a toddler  elche  biel and bolsa were all bestowed upon him  these territories would be controlled by eleanor  who had also received the city of huesca and some other villages and castles belonging to the aragonese crown at the time of her wedding  nor was this all  while all of the above grants had been made from among the possessions of the aragonese crown  the king also sought to bestow estates located within the kingdom of valencia upon the toddler ferdinand  but he was prevented from doing so  when the king granted ferdinand the cities of x  tiva  alzira  sagunto  morella  burriana and castell  n de la plana  all located in the kingdom of valencia  the local subjects protested  and for this reason the king decided to revoked these patents  these grants of land diminished the territorial patrimony of the crown and mainly affected the  infante  peter  alfonso s son by his first wife  who however was too young to make any significant protest  however  the issue agitated the court  created a climate of resentment and divided the nobility into two camps 

alfonso died in january       aged only     he was succeeded by peter iv  his    year old son from his first marriage

amasis ii

amasis ii    or ahmose ii was a pharaoh  reigned     bce    bce  of the twenty sixth dynasty of egypt  the successor of apries at sais  he was the last great ruler of egypt before the persian conquest 

most of our information about him is derived from herodotus       ff  and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence  according to the greek historian  he was of common origins  he was originally an officer in the egyptian army  his birthplace was siuph at sa  s  he took part in a general campaign of pharaoh psamtik ii in     bc in nubia 

a revolt which broke out among native egyptian soldiers gave him his opportunity to seize the throne  these troops  returning home from a disastrous military expedition to cyrene in libya  suspected that they had been betrayed in order that apries  the reigning king  might rule more absolutely by means of his greek mercenaries  many egyptians fully sympathized with them  general amasis  sent to meet them and quell the revolt  was proclaimed king by the rebels instead  and apries  who had now to rely entirely on his mercenaries  was defeated  apries fled to the babylonians and was captured and killed mounting an invasion of his native homeland in     bce with the aid of a babylonian army  an inscription confirms the struggle between the native egyptian and the foreign soldiery  and proves that apries was killed and honourably buried in the third year of amasis   bce   amasis then married chedebnitjerbone ii  one of the daughters of his predecessor apries  in order to legitimise his kingship 

some information is known about the family origins of amasis  his mother was a certain tashereniset  as a bust of her  today located in the british museum  shows  a stone block from mehallet el kubra also establishes that his maternal grandmother   tashereniset s mother   was a certain tjenmutetj 

his court is relatively well known  the head of the gate guard ahmose sa neith appears on numerous monuments  including the location of his sarcophagus  he was referenced on monuments of the   th dynasty and apparently had a special significance in his time  wahibre was  leader of the southern foreigners  and  head of the doors of foreigners   so he was the highest official for border security  under amasis the career of the doctor udjahorresnet began  who was of particular importance to the persians  several  heads of the fleet  are known  psamtek meryneit and pasherientaihet   padineith are the only known viziers 
herodotus describes how amasis ii would eventually cause a confrontation with the persian armies  according to herodotus  amasis was asked by cambyses ii or cyrus the great for an egyptian ophthalmologist on good terms  amasis seems to have complied by forcing an egyptian physician into mandatory labor  causing him to leave his family behind in egypt and move to persia in forced exile  in an attempt to exact revenge for this  the physician grew very close to cambyses and suggested that cambyses should ask amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the egyptians  cambyses complied and requested a daughter of amasis for marriage 

amasis  worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the persian king  refused to give up his offspring  amasis also was not willing to take on the persian empire  so he concocted a deception in which he forced the daughter of the ex pharaoh apries  whom herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by amasis  to go to persia instead of his own offspring 

this daughter of apries was none other than nitetis  who was  as per herodotus s account   tall and beautiful   nitetis naturally betrayed amasis and upon being greeted by the persian king explained amasis s trickery and her true origins  this infuriated cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it  amasis died before cambyses reached him  but his heir and son psamtik iii was defeated by the persians 

first  cyrus the great signed alliance agreements with the lydian king croesus and nabonidus the babylonian king in     bc  the actual aim of the agreements was to prevent aid between egypt and her allies  with both now deprived of egyptian support  the persians conquered  first  croesus s empire in     bce  and  then  the neo babylonian empire in     bce 

herodotus also describes that just like his predecessor  amasis relied on greek mercenaries and councilmen  one such figure was phanes of halicarnassus  who would later on leave amasis  for reasons herodotus does not clearly know but suspects were personal between the two figures  amasis sent one of his eunuchs to capture phanes  but the eunuch was bested by the wise councilman and phanes fled to persia  meeting up with cambyses and providing advice in his invasion of egypt  egypt was finally lost to the persians during the battle of pelusium in     bc 

although amasis appears first as champion of the disparaged native  he had the good sense to cultivate the friendship of the greek world  and brought egypt into closer touch with it than ever before  herodotus relates that under his prudent administration  egypt reached a new level of wealth  amasis adorned the temples of lower egypt especially with splendid monolithic shrines and other monuments  his activity here is proved by existing remains   for example  a temple built by him was excavated at tell nebesha 

amasis assigned the commercial colony of naucratis on the canopic branch of the nile to the greeks  and when the temple of delphi was burnt  he contributed       talents to the rebuilding  he also married a greek princess named ladice daughter of king battus iii and made alliances with polycrates of samos and croesus of lydia 

under amasis  egypt s agricultural based economy reached its zenith  herodotus  who visited egypt less than a century after amasis ii s death  writes that 
his kingdom consisted probably of egypt only  as far as the first cataract  but to this he added cyprus  and his influence was great in cyrene  libya  in his fourth year   bce   amasis was able to defeat an invasion of egypt by the babylonians under nebuchadnezzar ii  henceforth  the babylonians experienced sufficient difficulties controlling their empire that they were forced to abandon future attacks against amasis  however  amasis was later faced with a more formidable enemy with the rise of persia under cyrus who ascended to the throne in     bce  his final years were preoccupied by the threat of the impending persian onslaught against egypt  with great strategic skill  cyrus had destroyed lydia in     bce and finally defeated the babylonians in     bce which left amasis with no major near eastern allies to counter persia s increasing military might  amasis reacted by cultivating closer ties with the greek states to counter the future persian invasion into egypt but was fortunate to have died in     bce shortly before the persians attacked  the final assault instead fell upon his son psamtik iii  whom the persians defeated in     bce after a reign of only six months 

amasis ii died in     bc  he was buried at the royal necropolis of sais  and while his tomb was never discovered  herodotus describes it for us 

herodotus also relates the desecration of ahmose ii amasis  mummy when the persian king cambyses conquered egypt and thus ended the   th saite dynasty 

from the fifth century bce  there is evidence of stories circulating about amasis  in egyptian sources  including a demotic papyrus of the third century bce   herodotus  hellanikos  and plutarch s  convivium septem sapientium    in those tales amasis was presented as a non conventional pharaoh  behaving in ways unbecoming to a king but gifted with practical wisdom and cunning  a trickster on the throne or a kind of comic egyptian solomon  






alfonso v of aragon

alfonso the magnanimous kg  also alphonso                june       was the king of aragon  as alfonso v   valencia  as alfonso iii   majorca  sardinia and corsica  as alfonso ii   sicily  as alfonso i  and count of barcelona  as alfonso iv  from       and king of naples  as alfonso i  from      until his death  he was one of the most prominent figures of the early renaissance and a knight of the order of the dragon 

born at medina del campo  he was the son of ferdinand i of aragon and eleanor of alburquerque  he represented the old line of the counts of barcelona through the female line  and was on his father s side descended from the house of trastamara  the reigning house of castile  by hereditary right he was king of sicily and claimed the island of sardinia for himself  though it was then in the possession of genoa  alfonso was also in possession of much of corsica by the     s 
in      the childless queen joanna ii of naples adopted and named him as heir to the kingdom of naples  and alfonso went to naples  here he hired the condottiero braccio da montone with the task of reducing the resistance of his rival claimant  louis iii of anjou  and his forces led by muzio attendolo sforza  with pope martin v supporting sforza  alfonso switched his religious allegiance to the aragonese antipope benedict xiii  when sforza abandoned louis  cause  alfonso seemed to have all his problems solved  however  his relationship with joanna suddenly worsened  and in may      he had her lover  gianni caracciolo  a powerful figure in the neapolitan court  arrested 

after an attempt to arrest the queen herself had failed  joan called on sforza who defeated the aragonese militias near castel capuano in naples  alfonso fled to castel nuovo  but the help of a fleet of    galleys led by giovanni da cardona improved his situation  sforza and joanna ransomed caracciolo and retreated to the fortress of aversa  here she repudiated her earlier adoption of alfonso and  with the backing of martin v  named louis iii as her heir instead 

the duke of milan  filippo maria visconti  joined the anti aragonese coalition  alfonso requested support from braccio da montone  who was besieging joanna s troops in l aquila  but had to set sail for spain  where a war had broken out between his brothers and the kingdom of castile  on his way towards barcelona  alfonso destroyed marseille  a possession of louis iii 

in late      the genoese fleet of filippo maria visconti moved in the southern tyrrhenian sea  rapidly conquering gaeta  procida  castellammare and sorrento  naples  which was held by alfonso s brother  pedro de aragon  was besieged in      by the genoese ships and joanna s troops  now led by francesco sforza  the son of muzio sforza  who had met his death at l aquila   the city fell in april       pedro  after a short resistance in castel nuovo  fled to sicily in august  joanna ii and louis iii again took possession of the realm  although the true power was in the hands of gianni caracciolo 

an opportunity for alfonso to reconquer naples occurred in       when caracciolo was killed in a conspiracy  alfonso tried to regain the favour of the queen  but failed  and had to wait for the death of both louis  at cosenza in       and joanna herself  february        in her will  she bequeathed her realm to ren   of anjou  louis iii s younger brother  this solution was opposed by the new pope  eugene iv  who nominally was the feudal lord of the king of naples  the neapolitans having called in the french  alfonso decided to intervene and  with the support of several barons of the kingdom  captured capua and besieged the important sea fortress of gaeta  his fleet of    galleys was met by the genoese ships sent by visconti  led by biagio assereto  in the battle of ponza that ensued  alfonso was defeated and taken prisoner 

in milan  however  he impressed his captor with his cultured demeanor and persuaded him to let him go by making it plain that it was not in milan s interest to prevent the victory of the aragonese party in naples  helped by a sicilian fleet  alfonso recaptured capua and set his base in gaeta in february       meanwhile  papal troops had invaded the neapolitan kingdom  but alfonso bribed their commander  cardinal giovanni vitelleschi  and their successes waned 

in the meantime  ren   had managed to reach naples on    may       alfonso tried to besiege the city in the following september  but failed  his brother pedro was killed during the battle  castel nuovo  where an aragonese garrison resisted  fell to the angevine mercenaries in august       after the death of his condottiero jacopo caldora  however  ren   s fortune started to decline  alfonso could easily capture aversa  salerno  benevento  manfredonia and bitonto  ren    whose possession included now only part of the abruzzi and naples  obtained        men from the pope  but the cardinal leading them signed a truce with alfonso  giovanni sforza came with a reduced corps  as troops sent by eugene iv had halted his father francesco in the marche 

alfonso  provided with the most impressive artillery of the times  again besieged naples  the siege began on    november       ending on   june the following year  after the return of ren   to provence  alfonso easily reduced the remaining resistance and made his triumphal entrance in naples on    february       as the monarch of a pacified kingdom  in      he also conquered sardinia 

alfonso  by formally submitting his reign to the papacy  obtained the consent of pope eugene iv that the kingdom of naples would go to his illegitimate son ferdinand  he died in castel dell ovo in       while he was planning the conquest of genoa  at the time  alfonso was at odds with callixtus iii  who died shortly afterwards 

his spanish possessions were ruled for him by his brother john  later king john ii of aragon  sicily and sardinia were also inherited by his brother 

alfonso was also a powerful and faithful supporter of skanderbeg  whom he decided to take under his protection as a vassal in       shortly after the latter had scored his second victory against murad ii  in addition to financial assistance  he supplied the albanian leader with troops  military equipment  and sanctuary for himself and his family if such a need should arise  this was because in       while skanderbeg was victoriously fighting off the turkish invasions  three military columns  commanded by demetrio reres along with his sons giorgio and basilio  had been dispatched to help alfonso v defeat the barons of naples who had rebelled against him 

alfonso had been betrothed to maria of castile               sister of john ii of castile  in valladolid in       the marriage was celebrated in valencia on    june       they failed to produce children  alfonso had been in love with a woman of noble family named lucrezia d alagno  who served as a  de facto  queen at the neapolitan court as well as an inspiring muse 

genealogical records in the old occitan chronicle of montpellier in  le petit thalamus de montpellier  indicate that alphonso s relationship with his mistress  giraldona carlino  produced three children 


giraldona was the daughter of enrique carlino and his wife  isabel 

like many renaissance rulers  alfonso v was a patron of the arts  he founded the academy of naples under giovanni pontano  and for his entrance into the city in      had a magnificent triumphal arch added to the main gate of castel nuovo 
alfonso was particularly attracted to classical literature  he reportedly brought copies of the works of livy and julius caesar on his campaigns  the poet antonio beccadelli even claimed that alfonso was cured of a disease by the reading of a few pages from quintus curtius rufus  history of alexander the great  although this reputed erudition attracted scholars to his court  alfonso apparently enjoyed pitting them against each other in spectacles of bawdy latin rhetoric 

after his conquest of naples in       alfonso ruled primarily through his mercenaries and political lackeys  in his italian kingdom  he maintained the former political and administrative institutions  his holdings in spain were governed by his brother john 

a unified general chancellorship for the whole aragonese realm was set up in naples  although the main functionaries were of aragonese nationality  apart from financial  administrative and artistic improvements  his other accomplishments in the sicilian kingdom include the restoration of the aqueducts  the drainage of marshy areas  and the paving of streets 

alfonso was the object of diplomatic contacts from the empire of ethiopia  in       he received a letter from yeshaq i of ethiopia  borne by two dignitaries  which proposed an alliance against the muslims and would be sealed by a dual marriage that would require the infante peter to bring a group of artisans to ethiopia where he would marry yeshaq s daughter 

in return  alfonso sent a party of    craftsmen  all of whom perished on the way to ethiopia  he later sent a letter to yeshaq s successor zara yaqob in       in which he wrote that he would be happy to send artisans to ethiopia if their safe arrival could be guaranteed  but it probably never reached the emperor 




amathus

amathus or amathous    was an ancient city and one of the ancient royal cities of cyprus until about     bc  some of its impressive remains can be seen today on the southern coast in front of agios tychonas  about    miles west of larnaca and   miles east of limassol  its ancient cult sanctuary of aphrodite was the second most important in cyprus  her homeland  after paphos 

archaeological work has recently been continued at the site and many finds are exhibited in the limassol museum 

the pre history of amathus mixes myth and archaeology  archaeology has detected human activity from the earliest iron age  bc  
the city s legendary founder was cinyras  linked with the birth of adonis  who called the city after his mother amathous  according to a version of the ariadne legend noted by plutarch  theseus abandoned ariadne at amathousa  where she died giving birth to her child and was buried in a sacred tomb  according to plutarch s source  amathousians called the sacred grove where her shrine was situated the wood of aphrodite ariadne  more purely hellenic myth would have amathus settled instead by one of the sons of heracles  thus accounting for the fact that he was worshiped there 
it was said in antiquity that the people of amathus were autochthonous  or  pelasgian   their non greek language is confirmed on the site by eteocypriot inscriptions in the cypriot syllabary which alone in the aegean world survived the bronze age collapse and continued to be used down to the  th century bc 
amathus was built on the coastal cliffs with a natural harbour and flourished at an early date  soon requiring several cemeteries  greeks from euboea left their pottery at amathus from the   th century bc  during the post phoenician era of the  th century bc  a palace was erected and a port was also constructed  which served the trade with the greeks and the levantines  a special burial ground for infants  a  tophet  served the culture of the phoenicians  for the hellenes  high on the cliff a temple was built  which became a worship site devoted to aphrodite  in her particular local presence as  aphrodite amathusia  along with a bearded male aphrodite called  aphroditos   the excavators discovered the final stage of the temple of aphrodite  also known as aphrodisias  which dates approximately to the  st century bc  according to the legend  it was where festive adonia took place  in which athletes competed in hunting wild boars during sport competitions  they also competed in dancing and singing  all to the honour of adonis 
the earliest remains hitherto found on the site are tombs of the early iron age period of graeco phoenician influences           bc   amathus is identified with  kartihadasti   phoenician  new town   in the cypriote tribute list of esarhaddon of assyria      bc   it certainly maintained strong phoenician sympathies  for it was its refusal to join the philhellene league of onesilos of salamis which provoked the revolt of cyprus from achaemenid persia in         bc  when amathus was besieged unsuccessfully and avenged itself by the capture and execution of onesilos  herodotus reports

amathus was a rich and densely populated kingdom with a flourishing agriculture  grain and sheep  and copper mines situated very close to the northeast kalavasos 

about         bc  the philhellene evagoras of salamis was similarly opposed by amathus  allied with citium and soli  and even after alexander the city resisted annexation  and was bound over to give hostages to seleucus  its political importance was now ended but its temple of adonis and aphrodite amathusia remained famous in roman times  the epithet  amathusia  in roman poetry often means little more than  cypriote   but attesting to the fame of the city 

from the  th century bc the pedestals of two sculptures donated by the last basileus of amathous  androkles  representing his two sons  orestheus and andragoras  have survived  their inscriptions are in both eteozypric and greek languages 

the decline of amathous is often measured by the ptolemaic gifts to argos  where amathous donated only    drachmas in         bc  but kition and salamis gave      kourion      and paphos      however  this figure contradicts the archaeologic evidence of new buildings in this period including a balneion  a bath  a gymnasium  as well as fortifications of the acropolis  including a new tower  however  the port of paphos lost traffic compared to amathous in the ptolemaic period  an indication that paphos as the capital of the island perhaps offered fewer drachmas than the other cities for different reasons  like amathous 

in the roman era amathus became the capital of one of the four administrative regions of cyprus 

a roman temple was built in the  st century ad on top of the hellenistic predecessor  the temple facilities remained so important in roman times that  amathusia  was used as a synonym for  cypriot  

later  in the  th century ad  amasus became the see of a christian bishop and continued to flourish until the byzantine period  of its bishops  heliodorus was at the council of chalcedon in     and alexander at the second council of nicaea in      in the late  th century  saint ioannis eleimonas  john the charitable   protector of the knights of st  john  was born in amathus and after     sent theodorus  bishop of amathus  to jerusalem to ransom some slaves 

today  amathus is a see of the church of cyprus and is also listed  under the name  amathus in cypro   to distinguish it from  amathus in transjordan   as a titular see by the catholic church  which however  in line with the practice adopted after the second vatican council  has made no appointments to the bishopric since the death of the last latin titular bishop in      

anastasius sinaita  the famous  th century prolific monk of saint catherine s monastery  was born here  it is thought that he left cyprus after the     arab conquest of the island  setting out for the holy land  and eventually becoming a monk on sinai 

amathus declined and was already almost deserted when richard plantagenet won cyprus by a victory there over isaac comnenus in       the tombs were plundered and the stones from the beautiful edifices were brought to limassol to be used for new constructions  much later  in       a great number of blocks of stone from amathus were used for the construction of the suez canal  a ruined byzantine church marks its site 

a new settlement close to amathus but further inland  agios tychonas  is named after the bishop saint tychon of amathus  the site of the ruins is within the borders of this village  though the expansion of the limassol tourist area has threatened the ruins  it is speculated that some of the hotels are on top of the amathus necropolis 

the city had vanished  except for fragments of wall and of a great stone urn on the acropolis  dating from the  th century bc of which a similar vessel was taken to the mus  e du louvre in       it is tall and weighs    tons  it was made from a single piece of stone and has four curved handles carved with bulls  in the     s  luigi palma di cesnola excavated the necropolis of amathus  as elsewhere in cyprus  enriching the early collections of the metropolitan museum of art  some objects went to the british museum  more modern archaeological joint cypriote french excavations started in      and still continue  the acropolis  the temple of aphrodite  the agora  the city s walls  the basilica and the port have all been excavated 

further archaeological objects found during the excavations are preserved at both the cyprus museum in nicosia and the limassol district archaeological museum 
in the agora there are marble columns decorated with spirals and a huge paved squares  on the coastal side of the city there is an early christian basilica with mosaic floors decorated with semi precious stones  further  near the terraced road leading to the temple  situated on the top of the cliff  several houses built in a row dating to the hellenistic period have been discovered  at the east and west extremes of the city the two acropoleis are situated where a number of tombs have been found  many of which are intact 

two small sanctuaries  with terracotta votive offerings of graeco phoenician age  lie not far off  but the location of the great shrines of adonis and aphrodite have not been identified  m  ohnefalsch richter   kypros   i  ch

amati is the last name of a family of italian violin makers who lived at cremona from about      to       their importance is considered equal to those of the bergonzi  guarneri  and stradivari families  today  violins created by nicol   amati are valued at around          

andrea amati    designed and created the violin  viola and cello known as the  violin family   he standardized the basic form  shape  size  materials and method of construction  makers from nearby brescia experimented  such as gasparo da sal    micheli  zanetto and pellegrino  but it was andrea amati in cremona  italy  who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile 

the first violin was ordered by lorenzo de  medici in       his letter to amati stated the instrument was to be  made of the highest quality materials like that of a lute  but simple to play   what became of this first violin is not known  a number of his instruments survived for some time  dating between       amati made the first cello called  the king  in           and       the largest number these are from       a set for an entire orchestra of    ordered by catherine de m  dicis the regent queen of france and bore hand painted royal french decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son charles ix of france  of these    instruments ordered  amati created violins of two sizes  violas of two sizes and large sized cellos  they were in use until the french revolution of      and only    of these instruments survived  his work is marked by selection of the finest materials  great elegance in execution  soft clear amber  soft translucent varnish  and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design 
andrea amati was succeeded by his sons antonio amati           and girolamo amati             the brothers amati   as they were known  implemented far reaching innovations in design  including the perfection of the shape of the f holes  they are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of viola  in contrast to older tenor violas  but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that gasparo da salo made violas ranging from altos of     cm to tenors of       cm 

nicol   amati  december        april           was the son of girolamo amati  he was the most eminent of the family  he improved the model adopted by the rest of the amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of tone  his pattern was unusually small  but he also made a wider model now known as the  grand amati   which have become his most sought after violins 

of his pupils  the most famous were antonio stradivari and andrea guarneri  the first of the guarneri family of violin makers   there is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of antonio stradivari  while the label on stradivari s first known violin states that he was a pupil of amati  the validity of his statement is questioned  

the last maker of the family was nicol   s son  girolamo amati  known as hieronymus ii  february         february            although he improved on the arching of his father s instruments  by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest maker of his day  antonio stradivari 

instruments in the uk include andrea amati violins from the set delivered to charles ix of france in

amazons

in greek mythology  the amazons       singular      were a tribe of women warriors related to scythians and sarmatians  apollonius rhodius  at argonautica  mentions that amazons were the daughters of ares and harmonia  a nymph of the akmonian wood   they were brutal and aggressive  and their main concern in life was war 

herodotus and strabo place them on the banks of the thermodon  while diodorus giving the account of dionysius of mitylene  who  on his part  drew on thymoetas  states that before the amazons of the thermodon there were  much earlier in time  the amazons of libya  these amazons started from libya  passed through egypt and syria  and stopped at the ca  cus in aeolis  near which they founded several cities  later  he says  they established mytilene a little way beyond the ca  cus  aeschylus  in prometheus bound  places the original home of the amazons in the country about lake maeotis and they later moved to themiscyra on the thermodon  homer tells that the amazons were sought and found somewhere near lycia 

notable queens of the amazons are penthesilea  who participated in the trojan war  and her sister hippolyta  whose magical girdle  given to her by her father ares  was the object of one of the labours of heracles  diodorus mentions that the amazons traveled from libya under queen myrina  amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with greek warriors in amazonomachies in classical art 

archaeological discoveries of burial sites with female warriors on the eurasian steppes suggest that the scythian women may have inspired the myth  from the early modern period  their name has become a term for female warriors in general  amazons were said to have founded the cities and temples of smyrna  sinope  cyme  gryne  ephesus  pitania  magnesia  clete  pygela  latoreria and amastris  according to legend  the amazons also invented the cavalry 

palaephatus  who was trying to rationalize the greek myths in his work  on unbelievable tales  or  on incredible tales      stated that the amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet  tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards  and also  since they did not exist during his time  most probably they did n  t exist in the past either 

the origin of the word is uncertain  it may be derived from an iranian ethnonym   ha mazan    warriors   a word attested indirectly through a derivation  a denominal verb in hesychius of alexandria s gloss        to make war  in persian    where it appears together with the indo iranian root   kar    make   from which sanskrit  karma  is also derived  

it may also be derived from     manless  without husbands    a   privative and a derivation of   man   also found in slavic  muzh   has been proposed  an explanation deemed  unlikely  by hjalmar frisk    th century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym amazigh  a further explanation proposes iranian   ama janah   virility killing  as source 

among classical greeks   amazon  was given a folk etymology as originating from      and        without breast   connected with an etiological tradition once claimed by marcus justinus who alleged that amazons had their right breast cut off or burnt out  there is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art  in which the amazons are always represented with both breasts  although one is frequently covered  adrienne mayor suggests the origin of this myth was due to the word s etymology 

greeks also used some descriptive phrases for them  herodotus used the  androktones     singular        killers of men   and  androleteirai     singular        destroyers of men  murderesses    in the iliad they are also called  antianeirai     singular         against men   and aeschylus  in his work  prometheus bound   used  styganor       those who loathe all men   

herodotus and strabo placed them on the banks of the thermodon and themiscyra  herodotus also mentions that some amazons lived at scythia because after the greeks defeated the amazons in battle  they sailed away carrying in three ships as many amazons as they had been able to take alive  but out at sea the amazons attacked the crews and killed them  then these amazons landed at scythian lands  strabo writes that the original home of the amazons was in themiscyra and the plains about thermodon and the mountains that lie above them  but were later driven out of these places  and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above caucasian albania  not to be confused with the modern albania   but he also states that some others  among them metrodorus of scepsis and hypsicrates  say that after themiscyra  the amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the gargarians  in the northerly foothills of those parts of the caucasian mountains which are called ceraunian  diodorus giving the account of dionysius of mitylene  who  on his part  drew on thymoetas states that before the amazons of the thermodon there were  much earlier in time  the amazons of libya  these amazons started from libya passed through egypt and syria  and stopped at the ca  cus in aeolis  near which they founded several cities  later  he says  they established mitylene a little way beyond the ca  cus  aeschylus  in  prometheus bound   places the original home of the amazons in the country about lake maeotis and they later moved to themiscyra on the thermodon  according to pseudo plutarch  the amazons lived in and about the tanais    river  modern don river   formerly called the amazonian or amazon    river  because the amazons bathed themselves therein  the amazons later moved to themiscyra  speculated to be modern terme  though no ruins exist  on the river thermodon  the terme river in northern turkey  
plutarch mentions that the campaign s  of heracles and theseus against the amazons was at euxine sea  modern black sea   homer tells that the amazons were sought and found somewhere near lycia 
the amazons were supposed to have founded many towns  amongst them smyrna  ephesus  cyme  myrina  sinope  paphos  mitylene  at patmos there was a place called amazonium  also  on the island of lemnos  there was another myrina  the cities of myrina had this name after the amazon myrina 

apollonius rhodius  at argonautica  mentions that at thermodon the amazons were not gathered together in one city  but scattered over the land  parted into three tribes  in one part dwelt the themiscyreians     in another the lycastians     and in another the chadesians    

greeks also used other descriptive phrases for them  herodotus used the  androktones     singular        killers slayers of men   and  androleteirai     singular        destroyers of men  murderesses    in the iliad they are also called  antianeirai     singular         equivalent to men   and aeschylus used the  styganor       those who loathe all men   in his work prometheus bound 

herodotus stated that in the scythian language they were called  oiorpata    oior  meaning  man   and  pata  meaning  to slay  

in some versions of the myth  no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in amazon country  but once a year  in order to prevent their race from dying out  they visited the gargareans  a neighbouring tribe 

strabo  giving credits to metrodorus of scepsis and hypsicrates  mentions that at his time the amazons were believed to live on the borders of the gargareans  there were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the gargareans  the gargareans also  in accordance with an ancient custom  would go there to offer sacrifice with the amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children  they did this in secrecy and darkness  any gargareans at random with any amazon  and after making them pregnant they would send them away  any females that were born are retained by the amazons themselves  but the males would be taken to the gargareans to be brought up  and each gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own  regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty  he also stated that the gargareans went up from themiscyra into this region with the amazons  then  in company with some thracians and euboeans who had wandered thus far  waged war against them  they later ended the war against the amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children  and that each people should live independent of the other 
in addition  he states that the right breasts of all amazons are seared when they are infants  so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose  and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow 
herodotus mentions that when greeks defeated the amazons at war  they sailed away carrying in three ships as many amazons as they had been able to take alive  but out at sea the amazons attacked the crews and killed them  but the amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the scythians  there they met first with a troop of horses feeding  they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the scythians  the scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged  and they thought that they were men  scythians fought a battle against them  and after the battle the scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead  and thus they discovered that they were women  after the battle scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the amazons and to do whatsoever they should do  if the women should come after them  they were not to fight but to retire before them  and when the women stopped  they were to approach near and encamp  this plan was adopted by the scythians because they desired to have children born from them  when the amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm  they let them alone  and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day  and the young men  like the amazons  had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living  as the amazons did  by hunting and by taking booty  one day a scythian and an amazon came close  they could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the amazon made signs to him with her hand to come  later the young scythians and the amazons joined their camps and lived together  each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first  the men were not able to learn the language of the amazons  but the women learned scythian 
apollonius rhodius  at argonautica  mentions that amazons were the daughters of ares and harmonia  a nymph of the akmonian wood   they were brutal and aggressive  and their main concern in life was war  according to him  the amazons were not gathered together in one city  but scattered over the land  parted into three tribes  in one part dwelt the themiscyreians     in another the lycastians     and in another the chadesians     also  he mention that on an island  the queens of the amazons  otrere    and antiope     built a marble temple of ares  on this desert island there were ravening birds  which in countless numbers haunt it  the island mentioned is the aretias  argonauts passed by themiscyra on their journey to colchis  zeus sent boreas  the north wind   and with his help the argonauts stood out from the shore near themiscyra where the themiscyreian amazons were arming for battle 

the king iobates sent bellerophon against amazons  hoping that they would kill him  but bellerophon killed them all 

the amazons appear in greek art of the archaic period and in connection with several greek legends  the tomb of myrine is mentioned in the  iliad   later interpretation made of her an amazon  according to diodorus 

according to diodorus  the amazons under the rule of queen myrina  invaded the lands of the atlantians  amazons defeated the army of the atlantian city of cerne  treated the captives savagely  killed all the men  led into slavery the children and women  and razed the city  when the terrible fate of the inhabitants of cerne became known among the other atlantians  they were struck with terror  surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them  queen myrina bearing herself honourably towards the atlantians  established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of cerne which had been razed  and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired  atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours  and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation  diodorus also mentions that the amazons of queen myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes  from libya  to protect themselves at battle  later queen myrine led her amazons to victory against the gorgons  after the battle against the gorgons  myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs  which are called  amazon mounds     

one of the tasks imposed upon hercules by eurystheus was to obtain possession of the girdle of the amazonian queen hippolyta  he was accompanied by his friend theseus  who carried off the princess antiope  sister of hippolyta  an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of attica  in which antiope perished fighting by the side of theseus  in some versions  however  theseus marries hippolyta and in others  he marries antiope and she does not die  by this marriage with the amazon theseus had a son hippolytus  
in another version of this myth  theseus made this voyage on his own account  after the time of heracles 
the battle between the athenians and amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art  amazonomachy  in marble bas reliefs such as from the parthenon or the sculptures of the mausoleum of halicarnassus 
plutarch  in his work parallel lives the life of theseus  mentions that bion said that the amazons  were naturally friendly to men  and did not fly from theseus when he touched upon their coasts 

amazons attacked the phrygians  who were assisted by priam  then a young man  in his later years  however  towards the end of the trojan war  his old opponents took his side against the greeks under their queen penthesilea  of thracian birth   who was slain by achilles 

the god dionysus and his entourage fought the amazons at ephesus  the amazons fled to samos  but dionysus pursued them and at samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was  from that occurrence  called panaema     which means blood soaked field  in another myth dionysus united with the amazons to fight against cronus and the titans 

the amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the island of leuke  at the mouth of the danube  where the ashes of achilles had been deposited by thetis  the ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses  that they threw and trampled upon the invaders  who were forced to retire  pompey is said to have found them in the army of mithridates 

they are heard of in the time of alexander  when some of the king s biographers make mention of amazon queen thalestris visiting him and becoming a mother by him  the story is known from the  alexander romance    however  several other biographers of alexander dispute the claim  including the highly regarded secondary source  plutarch  in his writing he makes mention of a moment when alexander s secondary naval commander  onesicritus  was reading the amazon passage of his alexander history to king lysimachus of thrace who was on the original expedition  the king smiled at him and said  and where was i  then  

the roman writer virgil s characterization of the volscian warrior maiden camilla in the  aeneid  borrows heavily from the myth of the amazons 

jordanes   getica      purporting to give the earliest history of the goths  relates that the goths  ancestors  descendants of magog  originally dwelt within scythia  on the sea of azov between the dnieper and don rivers  after a few centuries  following an incident where the goths  women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe  while the menfolk were off campaigning against pharaoh vesosis  the women formed their own army under marpesia and crossed the don  invading asia  her sister lampedo remained in europe to guard the homeland  they procreated with men once a year  these amazons conquered armenia  syria  and all of asia minor  even reaching ionia and aeolia  holding this vast territory for     years  jordanes also mentions that they fought with hercules  and in the trojan war  and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the caucasus mountains until the time of alexander  he mentions by name the queens menalippe  hippolyta  and penthesilea 

in the grottaferrata version of  digenes akritas   the twelfth century medieval epic of basil  the greek syrian knight of the byzantine frontier  the hero battles with and kills the female warrior maximo 


there are several  conflicting  lists of names of amazons 

other names of amazons from various sources include 


according to ancient sources  plutarch  theseus  pausanias   amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient greek world  some are found in megara  athens  chaeronea  chalcis  thessaly at skotousa  in cynoscephalae  and statues of amazons are all over greece  stephanus of byzantium  quoting ephorus  mention that the tomb of the amazon anaea    was at the city of anaea     which also has this name after the amazon 

at both chalcis and athens  plutarch tells us that there was an amazoneum or shrine of amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult  at the entrance of athens there was a monument to the amazon antiope  on the day before the thesea at athens there were annual sacrifices to the amazons  in historical times greek maidens of ephesus performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by hippolyta and her amazons  they had initially set up wooden statues of artemis  a  bretas   pausanias       description of greece   book i  attica  

in works of art  battles between amazons and greeks are placed on the same level as     and often associated with     battles of greeks and centaurs  the belief in their existence  however  having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art  it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings  amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of scythian or sarmatian horsemen  their occupation was hunting and war  their arms the bow  spear  axe  a half shield  nearly in the shape of a crescent  called  pelta   and in early art a helmet  the model in the greek mind had apparently been the goddess athena  in later art they approach the model of artemis  wearing a thin dress  girt high for speed  while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly persian     that is  close fitting trousers and a high cap called the  kidaris   they were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot 
this depiction of amazons demonstrates just how closely  in the greek mind  the amazons were linked to the scythians  their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the crimea to mongolia  amazons were described by herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps  the double sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons  amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring  the battle between theseus and the amazons  amazonomachy  is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples  e g  the reliefs from the frieze of the temple of apollo at bassae  now in the british museum   vases and sarcophagus reliefs  at athens it was represented on the shield of the statue of athena parthenos  on wall paintings in the theseum and in the  stoa poikile   there were also three standard amazon statue types 

later in the renaissance  as amazon myth evolved  artists started to depict warrior women in a new light  queen elizabeth was often thought of as an amazon like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such  though  as explained in  divinia viagro  by winfried schleiner  celeste t  wright  has given a detailed account of the bad press amazons had in the renaissance  with respect to their unwomanly conduct and scythian cruelty   she notes that she has not found any elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an amazon  and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of amazons with enfranchisement of women  which was considered contemptible  

peter paul rubens and jan brueghel depicted the battle of the amazons around       showing many attributes of renaissance styled paintings  amazons also appear in the rococo period in another painting titled  battle of the amazons  by johann georg platzer  as a part of the romantic period revival  german artist anselm feuerbach painted the amazons as well  his paintings    engendered all the aspirations of the romantics  their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world  their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul  their search for a national identity  and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the germanic nation  finally  their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past    

herodotus reported that the sarmatians were descendants of amazons and scythians  and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs   frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands  in war taking the field  and wearing the very same dress as the men   moreover  said herodotus   no girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle   in the story related by herodotus  a group of amazons was blown across the maeotian lake  the sea of azov  into scythia near the cliff region  today s southeastern crimea   after learning the scythian language  they agreed to marry scythian men  on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of scythian women  according to herodotus  this band moved toward the northeast  settling beyond the tanais  don  river  and became the ancestors of the sauromatians  according to herodotus  the sarmatians fought with the scythians against darius the great in the  th century bc 

hippocrates describes them as   they have no right breasts   for while they are yet babies their mothers make red hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it  so that its growth is arrested  and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm  

amazons came to play a role in roman historiography  caesar reminded the senate of the conquest of large parts of asia by semiramis and the amazons  successful amazon raids against lycia and cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by lydian cavalry against the invaders  strabo        nicholas damascenus   gnaeus pompeius trogus pays particularly detailed attention to the amazons  the story of the amazons as deriving from a cappadocian colony of two scythian princes ylinos and scolopetos is due to him  pliny the elder records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the terme river as possibly being their home  a mountain named for them  the modern mason dagi   as well as a settlement amazonium  herodotus  vi     first mentions their capital themiscyra  which pliny locates near the terme  philostratus places the amazons in the taurus mountains  ammianus places them east of tanais  as neighbouring the alans  procopius places them in the caucasus  diodorus siculus   bibliotheca historica  iii  chapter     mentioned that besides pontus amazons existed much older race  at that time entirely disappeared  of amazons from western libya  and retells their mythological story which includes atlantis and greek mythology 

although strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity  the amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout late antiquity  several church fathers speak of the amazons as of a real people  solinus embraces the account of pliny  under aurelianus  captured gothic women were identified as amazons  claudianus   the account of justinus was influential  and was used as a source by orosius who continued to be read during the european middle ages  medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the amazons in the north  adam of bremen placing them at the baltic sea and paulus diaconus in the heart of germania 

amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the european renaissance  and with the age of exploration  they were located in ever more remote areas  in       francisco de orellana reached the amazon river   amazonas  in spanish   naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the nhamund   river  a tributary of the amazon  afterwards the whole basin and region of the amazon   amaz  nia  in portuguese   amazon  a  in spanish  were named after the river  amazons also figure in the accounts of both christopher columbus and walter raleigh  famous medieval traveller john mandeville mentions them in his book 

medieval and renaissance authors credit the amazons with the invention of the battle axe  this is probably related to the  sagaris   an axe like weapon associated with both amazons and scythian tribes by greek authors  see also thracian tomb of aleksandrovo kurgan   paulus hector mair expresses astonishment that such a  manly weapon  should have been invented by a  tribe of women   but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority  johannes aventinus 

ariosto s  orlando furioso  contains a country of warrior women  ruled by queen orontea  the epic describes an origin much like that in greek myth  in that the women  abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers  rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced  to prevent them from regaining power  the amazons and queen hippolyta are also referenced in geoffrey chaucer s  canterbury tales  in  the knight s tale  

classicist peter walcot wrote   wherever the amazons are located by the greeks  whether it is somewhere along the black sea in the distant north east  or in libya in the furthest south  it is always beyond the confines of the civilized world  the amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience  

nevertheless  there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the amazons of greek historiography  the most obvious candidates being historical scythia and sarmatia in line with the account by herodotus  but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of asia minor or even minoan crete 

speculation that the idea of amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials  pointing to the possibility that some sarmatian women may have participated in battle  these findings have led scholars to suggest that the amazonian legend in greek mythology may have been  inspired by real warrior women  

evidence of high ranking warrior women comes from kurgans in southern ukraine and russia 
david anthony notes   about     of scythian sarmatian  warrior graves  on the lower don and lower volga contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress  a phenomenon that probably inspired the greek tales about the amazons  
up to     of military burials were of armed sarmatian women usually including bows  russian archaeologist vera kovalevskaya points out that when scythian men were away fighting or hunting  nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves  their animals and pasture grounds competently  during the time that the scythians advanced into asia and achieved near hegemony in the near east  there was a period of twenty eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods  during this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves  but to reproduce  and this could well be the origin of the idea that amazons mated once a year with their neighbours  if herodotus actually based his accounts on fact 

before modern archaeology uncovered some of the scythian burials of warrior maidens entombed under kurgans in the region of altai mountains and sarmatia 

when minoan archeology was still in its infancy  nevertheless  a theory raised in an essay regarding the amazons contributed by lewis richard farnell and john myres to robert ranulph marett s  anthropology and the classics          placed their possible origins in minoan civilization  drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures  according to myres  the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in minoan culture  

francisco de orellana gave the amazon river its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors  whom he likened to the amazons 

the city of samsun in modern day turkey features a recently constructed  amazon village  museum  created to bring attention to the legacy of the amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism  a festival is also held every year in the terme district of samsun province to celebrate the amazons 

in greece  female equestrians are also called  amazons     

amazons became an important subject of the fine arts around       especially in the work of the munich painter and sculptor franz stuck                

in nazi germany open air events called  nacht der amazonen   night of the amazons  were performed at nymphenburg palace in munich between      and       these revues with bare breasted girls presented an allegedly emancipated female role as part of the    new race    intended to be realized by racial fanatics

ambergris

ambergris   or         ambergrease   or  grey amber   is a solid  waxy  flammable substance of a dull grey or blackish colour produced in the digestive system of sperm whales  freshly produced ambergris has a marine  fecal odor  however  it acquires a sweet  earthy scent as it ages  commonly likened to the fragrance of rubbing alcohol without the vaporous chemical astringency 

ambergris used to be very highly valued by perfumers as a fixative that allowed the scent to last much longer  but it has been replaced by synthetic ambroxan  dogs are known to be attracted to the smell of ambergris and are therefore sometimes used by ambergris searchers 

the word  ambergris  comes from the old french  ambre gris  or  grey amber   the word  amber  comes from the same source  but it has been applied almost exclusively to fossilised tree resins from the baltic region since the late   th century in europe 

ambergris is formed from a secretion of the bile duct in the intestines of the sperm whale  and can be found floating on the sea or washed up on the coast  it is also sometimes found in the abdomens of dead sperm whales  because the beaks of giant squids have been discovered within lumps of ambergris  scientists have theorized that the substance is produced by the whale s gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard  sharp objects that it may have eaten  the sperm whale usually vomits these  but if one travels further down the gut  it will be covered in ambergris 

ambergris is usually passed in the fecal matter  it is speculated that an ambergris mass too large to be passed through the intestines is expelled via the mouth  leading to the reputation of ambergris as primarily coming from whale vomit  ambergris takes years to form  christopher kemp  the author of  floating gold  a natural  and unnatural  history of ambergris   says that it is only produced by sperm whales  and only by an estimated one percent of them  ambergris is rare  once expelled by a whale  it often floats for years before making landfall  the very small chance of finding ambergris  and the legal ambiguity involved led perfume makers away from ambergris and led chemists on a quest to find viable alternatives 

ambergris is primarily found in the atlantic ocean and on the coasts of south africa  brazil  madagascar  the east indies  the maldives  china  japan  india  australia  new zealand  and the molucca islands  most commercially collected ambergris comes from the bahamas in the atlantic  particularly new providence  fossilised ambergris from      million years ago has also been found 

a lump of ambergris  found on a beach at anglesey  wales  was sold to a french buyer for          at an auction in macclesfield  england  on    september       a piece of ambergris was found by two omanis  washed up on a beach on the fooshi shores of sadah province in southern oman  in november      

ambergris is found in lumps of various shapes and sizes  usually weighing from     g       oz  to     kg       pounds   sometimes more  when initially expelled by or removed from the whale  the fatty precursor of ambergris is pale white in colour  sometimes streaked with black   soft  with a strong fecal smell  following months to years of photodegradation and oxidation in the ocean  this precursor gradually hardens  developing a dark grey or black colour  a crusty and waxy texture  and a peculiar odour that is at once sweet  earthy  marine  and animalic  its smell has been generally described as a vastly richer and smoother version of isopropanol without its stinging harshness  in this developed condition  ambergris has a specific gravity ranging from       to        it melts at about       c           f  to a fatty  yellow resinous liquid  and at it is volatilised into a white vapour  it is soluble in ether  and in volatile and fixed oils 

ambergris is relatively nonreactive to acid  white crystals of a terpene known as ambrein can be separated from ambergris by heating raw ambergris in alcohol  then allowing the resulting solution to cool  breakdown of the relatively scentless ambrein through oxidation produces ambroxan and ambrinol  the main odor components of ambergris 

ambroxan is now produced synthetically and used extensively in the perfume industry 

ambergris has been mostly known for its use in creating perfume and fragrance much like musk  perfumes can still be found with ambergris around the world  it is collected from remains found at sea and on beaches  although its precursor originates from the sperm whale  which is a vulnerable species 

ancient egyptians burned ambergris as incense  while in modern egypt ambergris is used for scenting cigarettes  the ancient chinese called the substance  dragon s spittle fragrance   during the black death in europe  people believed that carrying a ball of ambergris could help prevent them from getting the plague  this was because the fragrance covered the smell of the air which was believed to be a cause of plague 

this substance has also been used historically as a flavoring for food and is considered an aphrodisiac in some cultures  during the middle ages  europeans used ambergris as a medication for headaches  colds  epilepsy  and other ailments 

from the   th to the mid   th century  the whaling industry prospered  by some reports  nearly        whales  including sperm whales  were killed each year  due to studies showing that the whale populations were being threatened  the international whaling commission instituted a moratorium on commercial whaling in       although ambergris is not harvested from whales  many countries also ban the trade of ambergris as part of the more general ban on the hunting and exploitation of whales 

urine  faeces and ambergris  that has been naturally excreted by a sperm whale  are waste products not considered parts or derivatives of a cites species and are therefore not covered by the provisions of the convention

ambiorix

ambiorix  gaulish  king in all directions   was  together with cativolcus  prince of the eburones  leader of a belgic tribe of north eastern gaul  gallia belgica   where modern belgium is located  in the nineteenth century ambiorix became a belgian national hero because of his resistance against julius caesar  as written in caesar s  commentarii de bello gallico  

in    bc julius caesar conquered parts of gaul and also belgica  belgium  modern day northern france  luxembourg  part of present day netherlands below the rhine river  and the north western portion of north rhine westphalia  germany   there were several tribes in the country who fought against each other frequently  the eburones were ruled by ambiorix and catuvolcus  in    bc caesar s troops urgently needed more food  and so the local tribes were forced to give up part of their harvest  which had not been good that year  understandably the starving eburones were reluctant to do so and caesar ordered that camps be built near the eburones  villages  each centurion was ordered to make sure the food supplies were delivered to the roman soldiers  this created resentment among the eburones 

although julius caesar had freed him from paying tribute to the atuatuci  ambiorix joined catuvolcus in the winter of    bc in an uprising against the roman forces under q  titurius sabinus and l  aurunculeius cotta 

because a drought had disrupted his grain supply  caesar was forced to winter his legions among the rebellious belgic tribes  roman troops led by q  titurius sabinus and l  aurunculeius cotta were wintering among the eburones when they were attacked by them  led by ambiorix and cativolcus  ambiorix deceived the romans  telling them the attack was made without his consent  and further advised them to flee as a large germanic force was preparing to cross the rhine  trusting ambiorix  sabinus and cotta s troops left the next morning  a short distance from their camp  the roman troops were ambushed by the eburones and massacred 

elsewhere  another roman force under q  tullius cicero  brother of the orator marcus  were wintering amongst the nervii  leading a coalition of rebellious belgic tribes  ambiorix surrounded cicero s camp  after a long while  a roman messenger was finally able to slip through the belgic lines and get word of the uprising to caesar  mobilizing his legions  caesar immediately marched to cicero s aid  as they approached the besieged roman camp  the belgae moved to engage caesar s troops  vastly outnumbered  caesar ordered his troops to appear confused and frightened  and they successfully lured the belgae to attack them on ground favourable to the romans  caesar s forces launched a fierce counterattack  and soon put the belgae to flight  later  caesar s troops entered cicero s camp to find most of the men wounded 

meanwhile  indutiomarus  a leader of the treveri  began to harass labienus s camp daily  eventually provoking labienus to send out his cavalry with specific orders to kill indutiomarus  they did so  and routed the remnants of indutiomarus s army  caesar personally remained in gaul for the remainder of winter due to the renewed gallic threat 

when the roman senate heard what had happened  caesar swore to put down all the belgic tribes  ambiorix had killed a whole roman legion and five cohorts  a belgic attack on q  tullius cicero  then stationed with a legion in the territory of the nervii  failed due to the timely appearance of caesar  the roman campaigns against the belgae took a few years  but eventually the tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned  the eburones disappeared from history after this genocidal event  according to the writer florus  ambiorix and his men succeeded in crossing the rhine and disappeared without a trace 

caesar wrote about ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the gauls   de bello gallico   in this text he also wrote the famous line   of these  three regions   the belgae are the bravest           horum omnium fortissimi sunt belgae         

ambiorix remained a relatively obscure figure until the nineteenth century  when belgium became independent in      the national government started searching through their historical archives for people who could serve as national heroes  in caesar s  de bello gallico   ambiorix and his deeds were rediscovered  in      the belgian poet joannes nolet de brauwere van steeland wrote a lyrical epic about ambiorix and on september         a statue of ambiorix was erected on the main market square in tongeren  belgium  referred to by caesar as atuatuca  i e  atuatuca tungrorum 

today  ambiorix is one of the most famous characters in belgian history  many companies  bars and friteries have named themselves after him  and in many belgian comics such as suske en wiske and jommeke he plays a guest role  there was also a short lived comic called  ambionix   which featured a scientist teleporting a belgic chief  loosely based on ambiorix  to modern day belgium 

in the french comic asterix  in the album  asterix in belgium   asterix  obelix  dogmatix and vitalstatistix go to belgium because they are angry with caesar about his remark that the belgians are the bravest of all the gauls

amazon river

the amazon river      spanish and   in south america is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world  and by some definitions it is the longest 
the headwaters of the apur  mac river on nevado mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the amazon s most distant source  until a      study found it to be the cordillera rumi cruz at the headwaters of the mantaro river in peru  the mantaro and apur  mac join  and with other tributaries form the ucayali river  which in turn meets the mara    n river upstream of iquitos  peru  to form what countries other than brazil consider to be the main stem of the amazon  brazilians call this section the solim  es river above its confluence with the rio negro to form what brazilians call the amazon at the meeting of waters    at manaus  the river s largest city 

at an average discharge of about    approximately   greater than the next seven largest independent rivers combined   the amazon represents     of the global riverine discharge to the ocean  the amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world  with an area of approximately   the portion of the river s drainage basin in brazil alone is larger than any other river s basin  the amazon enters brazil with only one fifth of the flow it finally discharges into the atlantic ocean  yet already has a greater flow at this point than the discharge of any other river 

the river was initially known by europeans as the mara    n and the peruvian part of the river is still known by that name today  it later became known as the rio amazonas in spanish and portuguese  or the amazon in english 

the name rio amazonas was given after native warriors attacked a   th century expedition by francisco de orellana  the warriors were led by women  reminding de orellana of the amazon warriors  a tribe of women warriors related to iranian scythians and sarmatians mentioned in greek mythology 

the word amazon itself may be derived from the iranian compound  ha maz an    one  fighting together  or ethnonym   ha mazan    warriors   a word attested indirectly through a derivation  a denominal verb in hesychius of alexandria s gloss        to make war  in persian    where it appears together with the indo iranian root   kar    make   from which sanskrit  karma  is also derived  

during what many archaeologists call the  formative stage   amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of south america s highland agrarian systems  the trade with andean civilisations in the terrains of the headwaters in the andes  formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of the higher altitude civilisations of among others the muisca and incas  early human settlements were typically based on low lying hills or mounds 

shell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation  they represent piles of human refuse and are mainly dated between      and      years bp  they are associated with ceramic age cultures  no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists  artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds  they are best represented by the marajoara culture  figurative mounds are the most recent types of occupation 

there is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the amazon river were home to complex and large scale indigenous societies  mainly chiefdoms who developed large towns and cities  archaeologists estimate that by the time the spanish conquistador de orellana traveled across the amazon in       more than   million indigenous people lived around the amazon  these pre columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations  for instance  pre columbian indigenous people on the island of maraj   may have developed social stratification and supported a population of         people  in order to achieve this level of development  the indigenous inhabitants of the amazon rainforest altered the forest s ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire  scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repetitiously  the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients  this created dark soil areas known as  terra preta de   ndio    indian dark earth    because of the terra preta  indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures  further research has hypothesized that this practice began around        years ago  some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the amazon basin 

many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare  james stuart olson wrote   the munduruku expansion dislocated and displaced the kawah  b  breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups       munduruku  first came to the attention of europeans in      when they began a series of widespread attacks on brazilian settlements along the amazon river  

in march       spanish conquistador vicente y    ez pinz  n was the first documented european to sail up the amazon river  pinz  n called the stream  r  o santa mar  a del mar dulce   later shortened to  mar dulce   literally   sweet sea   because of its fresh water pushing out into the ocean  another spanish explorer  francisco de orellana  was the first european to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins  situated in the andes  to the mouth of the river  in this journey  orellana baptised some of the affluents of the amazonas like rio negro  napo and jurua  the name amazonas is taken from the native warriors that attacked this expedition  mostly women  that reminded de orellana of the mythical female amazon warriors from the ancient hellenic culture in greece 

gonzalo pizarro set off in      to explore east of quito into the south american interior in search of  el dorado   the  city of gold  and la canela  the  valley of cinnamon   he was accompanied by his second in command francisco de orellana  after   the coca river joined the napo river  at a point now known as puerto francisco de orellana   the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence  they continued downriver through an uninhabited area  where they could not find food  orellana offered and was ordered to follow the napo river  then known as  r  o de la canela    cinnamon river   and return with food for the party  based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named delicola  they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north 

de orellana took about    men  the boat  and some canoes and left pizarro s troops on    december       however  de orellana apparently missed the confluence  probably with the aguarico  where he was searching supplies for his men  by the time he and his men reached another village  many of them were sick from hunger and eating  noxious plants   and near death  seven men died at that village  his men threatened to mutiny if he followed his orders and the expedition turned back to join pizarro s larger party  he accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of spain  and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream  after a journey of      km down the napo river they reached a further major confluence  at a point near modern iquitos  and then followed the upper amazon  now known as the solim  es  for a further to its confluence with the rio negro  near modern manaus   which they reached on   june       on the nhamunda river  a tributary of the amazon downstream from manaus  orellana s party had a fierce battle with warriors who  they reported  were led by fierce female warriors who beat the men to death with clubs if they tried to retreat  orellana s men began referring to the women as amazons  a reference to the tribe of women warriors from greek mythology 

regarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon  pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees  but that they could not be profitably harvested  in fact  true cinnamon   cinnamomum verum   is not native to south america  other related cinnamon containing plants  of the family  lauraceae   are fairly common in that part of the amazon and pizarro probably saw some of these  the expedition reached the mouth of the amazon on    august       demonstrating the practical navigability of the great river 

in      another spanish conquistador  lope de aguirre  may have made the second descent of the amazon  historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the amazon or the orinoco river  which runs more or less parallel to the amazon further north 

portuguese explorer pedro teixeira was the first european to travel up the entire river  he arrived in quito in       and returned via the same route 

from      to       portuguese brazilian  bandeirante  ant  nio raposo tavares led an expedition from s  o paulo overland to the mouth of the amazon  investigating many of its tributaries  including the rio negro  and covering a distance of more than  

in what is currently brazil  ecuador  bolivia  colombia  peru  and venezuela  a number of colonial and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for the purpose of trade  slaving and evangelisation among the indigenous peoples of the vast rainforest  such as the urarina  in the late     s czech jesuit father samuel fritz  apostle of the omaguas  established some forty mission villages  fritz proposed that the mara    n river must be the source of the amazon  noting on his      map that the mara    n  has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called lauricocha  near hu  nuco   fritz reasoned that the mara    n is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream  and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the amazon  for most of the   th     th centuries and into the   th century  the mara    n was generally considered the source of the amazon 

early scientific  zoological and botanical exploration of the amazon river and basin took place from the   th century through the first half of the   th century 

the cabanagem revolt               was directed against the white ruling class  it is estimated that from    to     of the population of gr  o par    estimated at         people  died 

the total population of the brazilian portion of the amazon basin in      was perhaps          of whom about two thirds were europeans and slaves  the slaves amounting to about         the brazilian amazon s principal commercial city  par    now bel  m   had from        to        inhabitants  including slaves  the town of man  os  now manaus  at the mouth of the rio negro  had a population between       and        all the remaining villages  as far up as tabatinga  on the brazilian frontier of peru  were relatively small 

on   september       emperor pedro ii of brazil sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the amazon and gave the viscount of mau    irineu evangelista de sousa  the task of putting it into effect  he organised the  companhia de navega    o e com  rcio do amazonas  in rio de janeiro in       in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers  the  monarca    monarch    the  camet     the  maraj    and the  rio negro  

at first  navigation was principally confined to the main river  and even in      a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between par   and manaus  with steamers of     tons cargo capacity  a second line to make six round voyages a year between manaus and tabatinga  and a third  two trips a month between par   and camet    this was the first step in opening up the vast interior 

the success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the amazon  and a second company soon opened commerce on the madeira  pur  s and negro  a third established a line between par   and manaus  and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams  in that same period  the amazonas company was increasing its fleet  meanwhile  private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries 

on    july      the government of brazil  constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the upper amazon basin  especially peru  decreed the opening of the amazon to all countries  but they limited this to certain defined points  tabatinga     on the amazon  camet       on the tocantins  santar  m     on the tapaj  s  borba     on the madeira  and manaus     on the rio negro  the brazilian decree took effect on   september      

thanks in part to the mercantile development associated with steamboat navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for natural rubber  the peruvian city of iquitos became a thriving  cosmopolitan centre of commerce  foreign companies settled in iquitos  from whence they controlled the extraction of rubber  in      iquitos had a population of      and by      its population reached         in the     s  approximately       tons of rubber were being exported annually  and by      annual exports had grown to        tons  representing      of peru s exports  during the rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants  such as typhus and malaria  killed        native amazonians 

the first direct foreign trade with manaus commenced around       local trade along the river was carried on by the english successors to the amazonas company   the amazon steam navigation company   as well as numerous small steamboats  belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade  navigating the negro  madeira  pur  s and many other tributaries  such as the mara    n  to ports as distant as nauta  peru 

by the turn of the   th century  the exports of the amazon basin were india rubber  cacao beans  brazil nuts and a few other products of minor importance  such as pelts and exotic forest produce  resins  barks  woven hammocks  prized bird feathers  live animals  and extracted goods  such as lumber and gold 

since colonial times  the portuguese portion of the amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of european diseases 

four centuries after the european discovery of the amazon river  the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than   excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters  this situation changed dramatically during the   th century 

wary of foreign exploitation of the nation s resources  brazilian governments in the     s set out to develop the interior  away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land  the original architect of this expansion was president get  lio vargas  with the demand for rubber from the allied forces in world war ii providing funding for the drive 

in the     s  economic exploitation of the amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the  economic miracle  occurring at the time  this resulted in the development of  operation amazon   an economic development project that brought large scale agriculture and ranching to amazonia  this was done through a combination of credit and fiscal incentives 

however  in the     s the government took a new approach with the national integration programme  a large scale colonization programme saw families from northeastern brazil relocated to the  land without people  in the amazon basin  this was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the trans amazonian highway   transamaz  nica   

the trans amazonian highway s three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise  large portions of the trans amazonian and its accessory roads  such as br      manaus porto velho   are derelict and impassable in the rainy season  small towns and villages are scattered across the forest  and because its vegetation is so dense  some remote areas are still unexplored 

many settlements grew along the road from bras  lia to bel  m with the highway and national integration programme  however  the programme failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem  this  although the government believed it could sustain millions  instead could sustain very few 

with a population of     million people in       manaus is the largest city on the amazon  manaus alone makes up approximately     of the population of the largest brazilian state of amazonas  the racial makeup of the city is     pardo  mulatto and mestizo  and     white 

although the amazon river remains largely undammed  around     dams are in operation in the amazon s tributary rivers  from these     dams      are constructed over six of the main tributary rivers that drain into the amazon  since only four percent of the amazon s hydropower potential has been developed in countries like brazil  more damming projects are underway and hundreds more are planned  after witnessing the negative effects of environmental degradation  sedimentation  navigation and flood control caused by the three gorges dam in the yangtze river  scientists are worried that constructing more dams in the amazon will harm its biodiversity in the same way by    blocking fish spawning runs  reducing the flows of vital oil nutrients and clearing forests     damming the amazon river could potentially bring about the    end of free flowing rivers    and contribute to an    ecosystem collapse    that will cause major social problems 

the most distant source of the amazon was thought to be in the apur  mac river drainage for nearly a century  such studies continued to be published even recently  such as in                   and       where various authors identified the snowcapped nevado mismi peak  located roughly west of lake titicaca and southeast of lima  as the most distant source of the river  from that point  quebrada carhuasanta emerges from nevado mismi  joins quebrada apacheta and soon forms r  o lloqueta which becomes r  o hornillos and eventually joins the r  o apur  mac 

a      study by americans james contos and nicolas tripcevich in  area   a peer reviewed journal of the royal geographical society  however  identifies the most distant source of the amazon as actually being in the r  o mantaro drainage  a variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the mantaro river vs  the apur  mac river from their most distant source points to their confluence  showing the longer length of the mantaro  then distances from lago jun  n to several potential source points in the uppermost mantaro river were measured  which enabled them to determine that the cordillera rumi cruz was the most distant source of water in the mantaro basin  and therefore in the entire amazon basin   the most accurate measurement method was direct gps measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence  performed by contos   obtaining these measurements was difficult given the class iv   v nature of each of these rivers  especially in their lower  abyss  sections  ultimately  they determined that the most distant point in the mantaro drainage is nearly     km farther upstream compared to mt  mismi in the apur  mac drainage  and thus the maximal length of the amazon river is about     km longer than previously thought  contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the amazon river from its newly identified source  finishing november        a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread 

after about   the apur  mac then joins r  o mantaro to form the ene  which joins the perene to form the tambo  which joins the urubamba river to form the ucayali  after the confluence of apur  mac and ucayali  the river leaves andean terrain and is surrounded by floodplain  from this point to the confluence of the ucayali and the mara    n  some   the forested banks are just above the water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage  the low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills  and the river enters the enormous amazon rainforest 

although the ucayali   mara    n confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the amazon river proper  in brazil the river is known at this point as the  solim  es das   guas   the river systems and flood plains in brazil  peru  ecuador  colombia and venezuela  whose waters drain into the  solim  es  and its tributaries  are called the  upper amazon  

the amazon proper runs mostly through brazil and peru  and is part of the border between colombia and per    it has a series of major tributaries in colombia  ecuador and peru  some of which flow into the mara    n and ucayali  and others directly into the amazon proper  these include rivers putumayo  caquet    vaup  s  guain  a  morona  pastaza  nucuray  urituyacu  chambira  tigre  nanay  napo  and huallaga 

at some points the river divides into anabranches  or multiple channels  often very long  with inland and lateral channels  all connected by a complicated system of natural canals  cutting the low  flat  igap    lands  which are never more than above low river  into many islands 

from the town of canaria at the great bend of the amazon to the negro  vast areas of land are submerged at high water  above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear  near the mouth of the rio negro to serpa  nearly opposite the river madeira  the banks of the amazon are low  until approaching manaus  they rise to become rolling hills 

the lower amazon begins where the darkly coloured waters of the rio negro meet the sandy coloured rio solim  es  and for over these waters run side by side without mixing  at   bidos  a bluff above the river is backed by low hills  the lower amazon seems to have once been a gulf of the atlantic ocean  the waters of which washed the cliffs near   bidos 

only about ten percent of the amazon s water enters downstream of   bidos  very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley  the drainage area of the amazon basin above   bidos city is about   and  below  only about  around       exclusive of the of the tocantins basin  the tocantins river enters the southern portion of the amazon delta 

in the lower reaches of the river  the north bank consists of a series of steep  table topped hills extending for about from opposite the mouth of the xingu as far as monte alegre  these hills are cut down to a kind of terrace which lies between them and the river 

on the south bank  above the xingu  a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to santar  m in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest  and  abutting upon the lower tapaj  s  merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the tapaj  s river valley 

bel  m is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the atlantic ocean  the definition of where exactly the mouth of the amazon is located  and how wide it is  is a matter of dispute  because of the area s peculiar geography  the par   and the amazon are connected by a series of river channels called  furos  near the town of breves  between them lies maraj    the world s largest combined river sea island 

if the par   river and the maraj   island ocean frontage are included  the amazon estuary is some wide  in this case  the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from cabo norte  the cape located straight east of pracu  ba in the brazilian state of amap    to ponta da tijoca near the town of curu      in the state of par   

a more conservative measurement excluding the par   river estuary  from the mouth of the araguari river to ponta do navio on the northern coast of maraj    would still give the mouth of the amazon a width of over   if only the river s main channel is considered  between the islands of curu    state of amap    and jurupari  state of par     the width falls to about  

the plume generated by the river s discharge covers up to     million square kilometres and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north atlantic in terms of salinity  ph  light penetration  and sedimentation 

there are no bridges across the entire width of the river  this is not because the river would be too wide to bridge  for most of its length  engineers could build a bridge across the river easily  for most of its course  the river flows through the amazon rainforest  where there are very few roads and cities  most of the time  the crossing can be done by a ferry  so there is no need to build a bridge  the manaus iranduba bridge linking the cities of manaus and iranduba spans the rio negro  a tributary of the amazon  

while debate as to whether the amazon or the nile is the world s longest river has gone on for many years  the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the amazon as the second longest river in the world  with the nile being the longest  however  the amazon has been reported as being anywhere between long  it is often said to be  at least  long  the nile is reported to be anywhere from   often it is said to be  about  long  there are many factors that can affect these measurements  such as the the position of the geographical source and the mouth  the scale of measurement  and the length measuring techniques  for details see also list of rivers by length  

a study by brazilian scientists concluded that the amazon is actually longer than the nile  using nevado mismi  which in      was labelled by the national geographic society as the amazon s source  these scientists made new calculations of the amazon s length  they calculated the amazon s length as   using the same techniques  they calculated the length of the nile as   which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the amazon  they made it possible by measuring the amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of  canal do sul  and then  after a sharp turn back  following tidal canals surrounding the isle of maraj   and finally including the marine waters of the  r  o par    bay in its entire length  guido gelli  director of science at the brazilian institute of geography and statistics  ibge   told the brazilian tv network globo in june      that it could be considered as a fact that the amazon was the longest river in the world  however  other geographers have had access to the same data since       and a consensus has yet to emerge to support the claims of these brazilian scientists  a peer reviewed article  published in       concluded that the nile is longer than the amazon by stating a length of for the nile and for the amazon  measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions 
therefore  as of      the length of both amazon and nile remains open to interpretation and continued debate 

the amazon basin  the largest in the world  covers about     of south america  an area of approximately   it drains from west to east  from iquitos in peru  across brazil to the atlantic  it gathers its waters from   degrees north latitude to    degrees south latitude  its most remote sources are found on the inter andean plateau  just a short distance from the pacific ocean 

the amazon river and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season  every year  the river rises more than   flooding the surrounding forests  known as  v  rzea    flooded forests    the amazon s flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world  in an average dry season  of land are water covered  while in the wet season  the flooded area of the amazon basin rises to  

the quantity of water released by the amazon to the atlantic ocean is enormous  up to in the rainy season  with an average of from      to       the amazon is responsible for about     of the earth s fresh water entering the ocean  the river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean  the plume is about long and between wide  the fresh water  being lighter  flows on top of the seawater  diluting the salinity and altering the colour of the ocean surface over an area up to in extent  for centuries ships have reported fresh water near the amazon s mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean 

the atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the amazon s sediments out to sea  thus the amazon does not form a true delta  the great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water  while the amazon empties directly into the turbulent atlantic 

there is a natural water union between the amazon and the orinoco basins  the so called casiquiare canal  the casiquiare is a river distributary of the upper orinoco  which flows southward into the rio negro  which in turn flows into the amazon  the casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems  a so called bifurcation 

not all of the amazon s tributaries flood at the same time of the year  many branches begin flooding in november and might continue to rise until june  the rise of the rio negro starts in february or march and begins to recede in june  the madeira river rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the amazon river 

the depth of the amazon between manacapuru and   bidos has been calculated as between   at manacapuru  the amazon s water level is only about above mean sea level  more than half of the water in the amazon downstream of manacapuru is below sea level  in its lowermost section  the amazon s depth averages   in some places as much as  

the main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to manaus  upriver from the mouth  smaller ocean vessels of and draft can reach as far as iquitos  peru  from the sea  smaller riverboats can reach higher  as far as achual point  beyond that  small boats frequently ascend to the pongo de manseriche  just above achual point in peru 

annual flooding occurs in late northern latitude winter at high tide when the incoming waters of the atlantic are funnelled into the amazon delta  the resulting undular tidal bore is called the  pororoca   with a leading wave that can be up to high and travel up to inland 

the amazon river originated as a transcontinental river in the miocene epoch between      million and      million years ago and took its present shape approximately     million years ago in the early pleistocene 

the proto amazon during the cretaceous flowed west  as part of a proto amazon congo river system  from the interior of present day africa when the continents were connected  forming western gondwana  fifteen million years ago  the main tectonic uplift phase of the andean chain started  this tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the nazca plate underneath the south american plate  the rise of the andes and the linkage of the brazilian and guyana bedrock shields  blocked the river and caused the amazon basin to become a vast inland sea  gradually  this inland sea became a massive swampy  freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater  for example  over    species of stingray  most closely related to those found in the pacific ocean  can be found today in the freshwaters of the amazon 

eleven to ten million years ago  waters worked through the sandstone from the west and the amazon began to flow eastward  leading to the emergence of the amazon rainforest  during glacial periods  sea levels dropped and the great amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river  which would eventually become the world s largest  draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet 

paralleling the amazon river is a large aquifer  dubbed the hamza river  the discovery of which was made public in august      

more than one third of all known species in the world live in the amazon rainforest  a giant tropical forest and river basin with an area that stretches more than   it is the richest tropical forest in the world in terms of biodiversity  there are over       species of fish currently recognised in the amazon basin  with more being discovered every year  in addition to the thousands of species of fish  the river supports crabs  algae  and turtles 

along with the orinoco  the amazon is one of the main habitats of the  boto   also known as the amazon river dolphin   inia geoffrensis    it is the largest species of river dolphin  and it can grow to lengths of up to   the colour of its skin changes with age  young animals are gray  but become pink and then white as they mature  the dolphins use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the river s tricky depths  the  boto  is the subject of a legend in brazil about a dolphin that turns into a man and seduces maidens by the riverside 

the tucuxi   sotalia fluviatilis    also a dolphin species  is found both in the rivers of the amazon basin and in the coastal waters of south america  the amazonian manatee   trichechus inunguis    also known as  seacow   is found in the northern amazon river basin and its tributaries  it is a mammal and a herbivore  its population is limited to freshwater habitats  and  unlike other manatees  it does not venture into salt water  it is classified as vulnerable by the international union for conservation of nature 

the amazon and its tributaries are the main habitat of the giant otter   pteronura brasiliensis    sometimes known as the  river wolf   it is one of south america s top carnivores  because of habitat destruction and hunting  its population has dramatically decreased  it is now listed on appendix i of the convention on international trade in endangered species  cites   which effectively bans international trade 

the anaconda is found in shallow waters in the amazon basin  one of the world s largest species of snake  the anaconda spends most of its time in the water with just its nostrils above the surface  species of caimans  that are related to alligators and other crocodilians  also inhabit the amazon as do varieties of turtles 

the amazonian fish fauna is the centre of diversity for neotropical fishes        species are currently known  and approximately fifty new species are discovered each year  the arapaima  known in brazil as the  pirarucu   is a south american tropical freshwater fish  one of the largest freshwater fish in the world  with a length of up to   another amazonian freshwater fish is the arowana  or  aruan    in portuguese   such as the silver arowana   osteoglossum bicirrhosum    which is a predator and very similar to the arapaima  but only reaches a length of   also present in large numbers is the notorious piranha  an omnivorous fish that congregates in large schools and may attack livestock and even humans  there are approximately    to    species of piranha  however  only a few of its species are known to attack humans  most notably  pygocentrus nattereri   the red bellied piranha  the candir    native to the amazon river  is a species of parasitic fresh water catfish in the family trichomycteridae  just one of more than      species of catfish in the amazon basin  other catfish  walk  overland on their ventral fins  while the kumakuma   brachyplatystoma filamentosum    aka  piraiba  or  goliath catfish   can reach in length and in weight  the electric eel   electrophorus electricus   and more than     species of electric fishes  gymnotiformes  inhabit the amazon basin  river stingrays  potamotrygonidae  are also known  the bull shark   carcharhinus leucas   has been reported up the amazon river at iquitos in peru 

freshwater microbes are generally not very well known  even less so for a pristine ecosystem like the amazon  recently  metagenomics has provided answers to what kind of microbes inhabit the river  the most important microbes in the amazon river are actinobacteria  alphaproteobacteria  betaproteobacteria  gammaproteobacteria and crenarchaeota 

the amazon has over       tributaries     of which are over long  some of the more notable ones are 







alfred of beverley

alredus  or alfred of beverley   fl         english chronicler  was sacristan of the church of beverley in the first half of the twelfth century 

he wrote  apparently about the year       a chronicle entitled  annales sive historia de gestis regum britanniae   which begins with brutus and carries the history of england down to       geoffrey of monmouth and simeon of durham are alfred s chief sources 

alfred of beverley  was a priest of beverley  and is described in the preface to his book as  treasurer of the church of beverley  and  master alfred  sacrist of the church of beverley  

alfred of beverley speaks of himself as contemporary with the removal of the flemings from the north of england to ross in herefordshire in       and writes that he compiled his chronicle  when the church was silent  owing to the number of persons excommunicated under the decree of the council of london   an apparent reference to the council held at mid lent        his attention  by his own account  was first drawn to history by the publication  before       of geoffrey of monmouth s historia regum britanniae  and he looked forward to following up the chronicle which bears his name  and which largely depends on geoffrey s work  with a collection of excerpts from the credible portions of the historia regum britanniae  but no trace of such a work is extant 

alfred of beverley s chronicle is entitled  aluredi beverlacensis annales sive historia de gestis regum britanni   libris ix  ad annum        it is largely devoted to the fabulous history of britain  and is mainly borrowed from bede  henry of huntingdon  and symeon of durham  when geoffrey of monmouth is not laid under contribution  alfred quotes occasionally from suetonius  orosius  and nennius  and names many roman authors whom he had consulted in vain for references to britain  the chronicle is of no real use to the historical student  since it adds no new fact to the information to be found in well known earlier authorities 

according to sidney lee        the best manuscript of alfred s  annales  was among the hengwrt mss  belonging to w  w  e  wynne  esq   of peniarth  merionethshire  and had not been printed  hearne printed the    annales    in      from an inferior bodleian ms   rawl  b

autpert ambrose

autpert ambrose  ambroise      ca               was a frankish benedictine monk 

he became abbot of san vincenzo al volturno in south italy in the time of desiderius  king of the lombards  autpert s election as abbot caused internal dissent at st  vicenzo  and both pope stephen iii and charlemagne intervened  the disagreement was based both on objections to autpert s personality and to his frankish origin 

he wrote a considerable number of works on the bible and religious subjects generally  among these are commentaries on the apocalypse  on the psalms  and on the song of solomon   lives of saints paldo  tuto and vaso    assumption of the virgin   and a  combat between the virtues and the vices  

in       pope benedict xvi gave a homily about him in saint peter s square  in this homily  autpert s death date is given as      older scholarship had given a date between     and      




abu bakr

ab   bakr a       idd  q    abdall  h bin ab   qu     fah        ce   august     ce   popularly known as abu bakr  was a companion and   through his daughter aisha   a father in law of the islamic prophet muhammad 

abu bakr was born in mecca in     ce to uthman abu quhafa and salma umm al khair  he is commonly regarded as the fourth person to have accepted islam  after khadija bint khuwaylid  ali ibn abi talib  and zayd ibn harith  abu bakr was present at a number of battles of islam  such as the battle of badr and the battle of uhud  he was  however  among the muslims who ran away from the battle of uhud when they were not supposed to  which contributed to the muslims  defeat in the battle 

abu bakr was present at the farewell pilgrimage in     ce  after the pilgrimage  and shortly before muhammad s death  abu bakr was one of many who pledged allegiance to ali at the event of ghadir khumm  however  shortly after muhammad passed away  abu bakr and some others left the still unburied body of muhammad and gathered at a place known as saqifa  after lengthy debates that included violence  umar ibn al khattab pledged allegiance to abu bakr at saqifa  he was followed in this by two others at saqifa  as well as a group of bedouin tribesmen who had arrived at the scene  saqifa was later described as  a scene from the period of jahiliya  the pre islamic era   

abu bakr thus assumed power  ruling over the rashidun caliphate from     to     ce  once in power  abu bakr launched the ridda wars to quell an outbreak of  apostasy  in various lands outside medina  the ridda wars  however  were expanded to include the use of force against muslims who did not recognize abu bakr s government  instead of solely focusing on those who had left islam  after the conclusion of the ridda wars  abu bakr launched campaigns into syria and persia  but died before their conclusion  other significant events during abu bakr s reign include an attack on muhammad s family and the seizure of the land of fadak from fatimah  muhammad s daughter 

in     ce  abu bakr fell ill from a sickness and died shortly thereafter  he was succeeded by umar 

abu bakr s full name was ab   bakr a       idd  q abd allah ibn  uthman ibn aamir ibn amr ibn ka ab ibn sa ad ibn taym  from whom the at taymi al quraishi  ibn murrah ibn ka ab ibn lu ai ibn ghalib ibn fihr al quraishi 

the lineage of abu bakr joined that of muhammad in the eighth degree in their common ancestor murrah ibn ka b  the patrilineal lineage of abu bakr was  abu bakr  the son of uthman abu quhafa  the son of amar  the son of umru  the son of saad  the son of taym  the son of murrah  the son of kaab  the lineage of muhammad was  muhammad  the son of abd allah ibn abd al muttalib  the son of abdul muttalib  the son of hashim ibn  abd manaf  the son of abd manaf ibn qusai  the son of qusai ibn kilab  the son of kilab ibn murrah  the son of murrah 

in arabic  the name  abd allah  means  servant of allah   one of his early titles  preceding his conversion to islam  was  atiqe    the saved one   muhammad later reaffirmed this title when he said that abu bakr is the  atiqe   the one saved from hell fire by god   he was called  al siddiq   the truthful  by muhammad after he believed him in the event of isra and mi raj when other people didn t  and ali confirmed that title several times 

there is a dispute over his name being abdullah  ibn hajar in  al isaabah   vol     p       and many other narrations  narrates from qasim ibn muhammad ibn abi bakr   i asked ayesha the name of abu bakr  she said abdullah  i said people are saying ateeq  she said abu quhafa had three children  one was ateeq  second mu   taq and third  otaiq  all three names are similar and derived from the same root  

he was mentioned in the quran as the  second of the two who lay in the cave  in reference to the event of hijra  where with muhammad he hid in the cave in jabal thawr from the meccan search party that was sent after them  thus being one of few who were given direct mention in the quran 

imam jafar al sadiq famously narrated how the title  siddiq  was given to abu bakr from muhammad  jafar was a direct descendant of abu bakr from his maternal side  as well as being a descendant of ali from his father s side  jafar al sadiq was also the successor of the naqshbandi sufi order believed to be originating from abu bakr himself  imam muhammad al baqir  the father of imam jafar sadiq  also called abu bakr with the title siddiq 

much of the available knowledge about muhammad comes through abu bakr s daughter  aisha  after the death of abu bakr  her brother muhammad ibn abi bakr was raised by ali  after muhammad ibn abi bakr was killed by the umayyads  aisha raised and taught her nephew al qasim ibn muhammad ibn abi bakr  aisha also taught another nephew urwah ibn zubayr  he then taught his son hisham ibn urwah  who was the main teacher of malik ibn anas whose views many sunni follow 

qasim s mother was of    ali s family and his daughter farwah bint al qasim  who married muhammad al baqir  was the mother of jafar al sadiq  therefore al qasim was the grandson of the first caliph abu bakr and the grandfather of ja far al sadiq 

another of abu bakr s grandsons  abd allah ibn al zubayr  was very close to husayn bin ali  after hussein ibn ali was betrayed by the people of kufa and killed by the army of yazid i  the umayyad ruler  abd allah ibn al zubayr confronted yazid and expelled him from iraq  southern arabia and the greater part of syria  and parts of egypt  following a lengthy campaign  on his last hour abd allah ibn al zubayr asked his mother asma  bint abu bakr  the daughter of the first caliph  for advice  asma  bint abu bakr replied to her son   you know better in your own self  that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth  for people more honourable than you have been killed and if you are not upon the truth  then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you  if you say  that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others  then you will not truly be free   abd allah ibn al zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the syrian army now under the control of the umayyads 

abu bakr was born in mecca some time in     ce  to a rich family in the banu taym clan of the quraysh tribe  abu bakr s father s name was uthman abu quhafa  nicknamed  abu quhafa   and his mother was salma bint sakhar  nicknamed  umm ul khair   

he spent his early childhood like other arab children of the time  among the bedouins who called themselves  ahl i ba eer   the people of the camel  and developed a particular fondness for camels  in his early years he played with the camel calves and goats  and his love for camels earned him the nickname   abu bakr    the father of the camel s calf 

when abu bakr was    years old  he went to syria along with his father with the merchants  caravan  muhammad  who was    years old at the time  was also with the caravan  in     at the age of     abu bakr went into trade and adopted the profession of cloth merchant  which was the family s business  in the coming years abu bakr traveled extensively with caravans  business trips took him to yemen  syria  and elsewhere  these travels brought him wealth and added to his experience  his business flourished and he rose in the scale of social importance  though his father  uthman abu quhafa  was still alive  he came to be recognized as chief of his tribe 

like other children of the rich meccan merchant families  abu bakr was literate and developed a fondness for poetry  he used to attend the annual fair at ukaz  and participate in poetical symposia  he had a very good memory and had a good knowledge of the genealogy of the arab tribes  their stories and their politics 

a story is preserved that once when he was a child  his father took him to the kaaba  and asked him to pray before the idols  his father went away to attend to some other business  and abu bakr was left alone with the idols  addressing an idol  abu bakr said  o my god  i am in need of beautiful clothes  bestow them on me   the idol remained indifferent  then he addressed another idol saying  o god  give me some delicious food  see that i am so hungry   the idol remained cold  that exhausted the patience of young abu bakr  he lifted a stone  and addressing an idol said  here i am aiming a stone  if you are a god protect yourself   abu bakr hurled the stone at the idol and left the kaaba  thereafter  he never went to the kaaba to pray to the idols 

abu bakr was a thin man with white skin  tabari relates  suyuti also relates the same through ibn sa d al baghdadi s report  from aisha her description of abu bakr 
he was a man with fair skin  thin  emaciated  with a sparse beard  a slightly hunched frame  sunken eyes and protruding forehead  and the bases of his fingers were hairless he remained a  hanif  until converting to islam and never worshipped idols 

on his return from a business trip from yemen  friends informed him that in his absence muhammad had declared himself the messenger of god and proclaimed a new religion  tabari  the most famous muslim historian  in his ta rikh quotes from muhammad bin sa ad bin abi waqqas  who said  
other sunni and all shi a muslims maintain that the second person to publicly accept muhammed as the messenger of god was ali ibn abi talib  the first being muhammad s wife khadija 

ibn kathir in his al bidaya wal nihayah disregards the above  he stated that the first woman to embrace islam was khadijah  zaid bin haarithah was the first freed slave to embrace islam  and ali ibn abi talib was the first child to embrace islam for he has not even reached the age of puberty at that time  and abu bakr was the first free man to embrace islam 

his wife qutaylah bint abd al uzza did not accept islam and he divorced her  his other wife  um ruman  became a muslim  all his children except abdu l rahman ibn abu bakr accepted islam  and abu bakr separated himself from his son abdu l rahman 

his conversion brought many people to islam  he persuaded his intimate friends to convert to islam  and presented islam to others in such a way that many of his friends accepted islam 

those who converted to islam at the insistence of abu bakr were 

abu bakr s acceptance proved to be a milestone in muhammad s mission  slavery was common in mecca  and many slaves accepted islam  when an ordinary free man accepted islam  despite opposition  he would enjoy the protection of his tribe  for slaves however  there was no such protection and they commonly experienced persecution  abu bakr felt compassion for slaves  so he purchased eight slaves  four men and four women  and then freed them  paying        dinar for their freedom 

the men were
the women were 

most of the slaves liberated by abu bakr were either women or old and frail men  the father of abu bakr asked him why he doesn t liberate strong and young slaves who could be a source of strength for him  abu bakr replied that he was freeing the slaves for the sake of allah  and not for his own sake 

for three years after the birth of islam  muslims kept secret their faith  and prayed in secret  in     muhammad was commanded by god to call people to islam openly  the first public address inviting people to offer allegiance to muhammad was delivered by abu bakr  in a fit of fury the young men of the quraysh tribe rushed at abu bakr  and beat him mercilessly till he lost consciousness  following this incident abu bakr s mother converted to islam  abu bakr was persecuted many times by the quraysh  abu bakr s beliefs would have been defended by his own clan  but not by the entire quraysh tribe 

in      the quraysh enforced a boycott against the banu hashim  muhammad along with his supporters from banu hashim  were cut off in a pass away from mecca  all social relations with the banu hashim were cut off and their state was that of imprisonment  before it many muslims migrated to abyssinia  now ethiopia   abu bakr  feeling distressed  set out for yemen and then to abyssinia from there  he met a friend of his named ad dughna  chief of the qarah tribe  outside mecca  who invited abu bakr to seek his protection against the quraysh  abu bakr went back to mecca  it was a relief for him  but soon due to the pressure of quraysh  ad dughna was forced to renounce his protection  once again the quraysh were free to persecute abu bakr 

in      muhammad s uncle and protector  abu talib ibn abd al muttalib  and muhammad s wife khadija died  abu bakr s daughter aisha was engaged to muhammad  however it was decided that the actual marriage ceremony would be held later  in     abu bakr was the first person to testify to muhammad s isra and mi raj  night journey  

in      on the invitation of the muslims of medina  muhammad ordered muslims to migrate to medina  the migration began in batches  ali was the last to remain in mecca  entrusted with responsibility for settling any loans the muslims had taken  and famously slept in the bed of muhammad when the quraysh led by ikrima attempted to murder muhammad as he slept  meanwhile  abu bakr accompanied muhammad in his migration for medina  due to the danger of the quraysh  they did not take the road to medina  they moved in the opposite direction  and took refuge in a cave in jabal thawr some five miles south of mecca   abdullah ibn abi bakr  the son of abu bakr  would listen to the plans and talks of the quraysh  and at night he would carry the news to the fugitives in the cave  asma bint abi bakr  the daughter of abu bakr  brought them meals every day  aamir  a servant of abu bakr  would bring a flock of goats to the mouth of the cave every night where they were milked  the quraysh sent search parties in all directions  one party came close to the entrance to the cave  but was unable to sight them  due to this  qur an verse was revealed  aisha  abu sa   id al khudri and abdullah ibn abbas in interpreting this verse said that abu bakr was the companion who stayed with muhammad in the cave 

after staying at the cave for three days and three nights  abu bakr and muhammad proceed to medina  staying for some time at quba  a suburb of medina 

in medina  muhammad decided to construct a mosque  a piece of land was chosen and the price of the land was paid for by abu bakr  muslims constructed a mosque named al masjid al nabawi at the site and abu bakr also took part in construction  abu bakr was paired with khaarij ah bin zaid ansari  who was from medina  as a brother in faith  abu bakr s relationship with khaarjah was most cordial  which was further strengthened when abu bakr married habiba  a daughter of khaarijah 

khaarij ah bin zaid ansari used to live at sunh  a suburb of medina  and abu bakr also settled there  after abu bakr s family arrived in medina he bought another house near muhammad s 

the climate of mecca was dry  but the climate of medina was damp and this adversely affected the health of the immigrants  so that on arrival most of them fell sick  abu bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by khaarijah and his family  at mecca  abu bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in medina  he was a wholesaler  and had his store at sunh  and from there cloth was supplied to the market at medina  soon his business flourished at medina  early in      abu bakr s daughter aisha  who was already engaged to muhammad  was handed over to muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony  and this further strengthened the relation between abu bakr and muhammad 

in     abu bakr was involved in the first battle between the muslims and the quraysh of mecca  known as the battle of badr  but did not fight  instead acting as one of the guards of muhammad s tent  in     he participated in the battle of uhud that ended resultless but the muslims suffered heavy loss of lives  before the battle begun  abu bakr s son abdu l rahman ibn abu bakr  who was still non muslim and fighting from the side of the quraysh  came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel  abu bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by muhammad  his son later converted to islam and gained fame during the muslim conquest of syria as a fierce warrior  in the second phase of the battle  khalid ibn al walid   s cavalry attacked the muslims from behind  causing dozens of casualties to the muslim that changed the course of the war  many muslim warriors fled from the battlefield due to fear or to plunder the spoils of war  ali ibn abi talib  and a few other muslims remained guarding muhammad from the attacks of the quraysh soldiers  majority of shia and many sunni hadith agree to this 

in     he participated in the battle of the trench and also in the invasion of banu qurayza  in this battle  muhammad divided the ditch into a number of sectors and a contingent was posted to guard each sector  one of such contingents was under the command of abu bakr  the enemy made frequent assaults in the attempt to cross the ditch  all such assaults were repulsed  abu bakr showed great courage in guarding the belt of the trench in his sector  to commemorate this event a mosque was later constructed at the site where abu bakr had heroically repulsed the charges of the enemy  the mosque was later known as  masjid i siddiq  

in     he participated in treaty of hudaybiyyah and was made one of the witnesses over the pact 

abu bakr took part in the battle of khaybar  khaybar had eight fortresses  the strongest and most well guarded fortress was called al qamus  muhammad sent abu bakr with a group of warriors to attempt to conquer the fortress  however  abu bakr was unsuccessful in capturing the fortress  muhammad also sent umar with a group of warriors  but umar could not conquer al qamus either  some other muslims also attempted to capture the fort  but they were unsuccessful as well  finally  muhammad sent ali  who was victorious  ali defeated the marhab  the leader of the opponents of islam  thus giving the muslims a victory 

in     muhammad sent  amr ibn al  as to zaat ul sallasal from where he called for reinforcements and muhammad sent abu ubaidah ibn al jarrah  commanding an army under him were abu bakr and umar and they attacked and defeated the enemy 

in     when muslim armies rushed for the conquest of mecca  abu bakr was a part of the army  before the conquest of mecca his father uthman abu quhafa converted to islam 

in     he was part of battle of hunayn and siege of ta if  in the battle of hunayn as the muslim army passed through the valley of hunayn some eleven miles north east of mecca a rain of arrows fell on it let loose by a group of archers of the hostile tribes that lay hid in the mountain pass  taken unaware the advance guard of the muslim army fled in panic  there was considerable confusion  and the camels  horses and men ran into one another in the attempt to seek cover  muhammad stood firm  there were only nine companions around him including abu bakr  all the rest had fled  under the instructions of muhammad  abbas shouted at the top of his voice  o muslims come to the prophet of allah   the call was heard by the muslim soldiers and they gathered beside muhammad  when the muslim had gathered in sufficient number  muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy  in the hand to hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to autas 

muhammad posted a contingent to guard the hunayn pass and led the main army to autas  in the confrontation at autas the tribes could not withstand the muslim onslaught  finding the resistance useless the tribes broke the camp and retired to ta if 

abu bakr was commissioned by muhammad to lead the attack against ta if  from autas the muslim forces set out for ta if  the tribes shut themselves in the fort and refused to come out in the open  the muslim employed catapults to throw stones in the town  but this did not lead to any tangible results  the muslim tried the testudo device whereunder a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate  the enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo which made it ineffective 

the siege dragged on for two weeks  and still there was no sign of the fall of the fort  muhammad held a council of war  abu bakr advised that the siege might be raised and that god would himself make arrangements for the fall of the fort  the advice was accepted  and in february      the siege of ta if was raised and the muslim army returned to mecca  a few days later malik bin auf the commander  came to mecca and became a muslim  thus the forecast of abu bakr came to be fulfilled  and the god himself arranged for the surrender of ta if 

in     ad  muhammad sent from medina a delegation of three hundred muslims to perform the hajj according to the new islamic way  abu bakr was appointed as the leader of the delegates  the day after abu bakr and his party had left for hajj  muhammad received a new revelation  surah tawbah  the ninth chapter of the qur an  it is related that when this revelation came  someone suggested to muhammad that he should send news of it to abu bakr  muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation 

muhammad summoned ali  and asked him to proclaim a portion of surah tawbah to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at mina  ali went forth on muhammad s slit eared camel  and overtook abu bakr  when ali joined the party  abu bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them  ali said that he had not come to replace abu bakr as amir ul hajj  and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of muhammad 

at mecca  abu bakr presided at the hajj ceremony  and ali read the proclamation on behalf of muhammad  the main points of the proclamation were 


from the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned in arabia  henceforward islam alone was to be supreme in arabia 

abu bakr also led one military campaign as commander  known as expedition of abu bakr as siddiq  which took place in nejd  in july     ad   rd month  ah in the islamic calendar   abu bakr led a large platoon in nejd on the order of muhammad  many were killed and taken as prisoner  the sunni hadith collection  sunan abu dawud  mentions the event

abu bakr attended the event of ghadir khumm  which took place a few months before muhammad passed away  according to both shia and sunni sources  he was among the many who pledged allegiance to ali at the event 

in medina  after the farewell pilgrimage and the event of ghadir khumm and shortly before his death  muhammad ordered an army under the command of usama bin zayd  he commanded all the companions  except for his family  to go with usama to syria to avenge the muslims    defeat at the battle of mu tah  muhammad gave usama the banner of islam on the   th day of the islamic month of safar in the year    a h  abu bakr and umar were among those that muhammad commanded to join usama   s army 

however  abu bakr and umar resisted going under the command of usama because they thought that he  who was    or    at the time  was too young to lead an army  despite muhammad   s teachings that age and standing in society did not necessarily correspond to being a good general 

in response to these worries  the prophet said   o arabs  you are miserable because i have appointed usama as your general  and you are raising questions if he is qualified to lead you in war  i know you are the same people who had raised the same question about his father  by god  usama is qualified to be your general just as his father was qualified to be a general  now obey his orders and go   whenever muhammad felt any relief from his fatal sickness  he would inquire as to whether usama   s army had left for syria yet  and would continue urging his companions to leave for syria  muhammad even reportedly said   usama s army must leave at once  may allah curse those men who do not go with him   however  while a few companions were ready to join usama   s army  many other companions  including abu bakr and umar  disobeyed muhammad   s orders  it is also noted that this was the only battle expedition where muhammad urged his companions to go the battle no matter what  for other battles  if someone was unable to go to the fight  muhammad would let them stay at home 

during muhammad s lifetime  the muslims in medina were divided into two groups  the ansar  who were originally from medina  and the muhajirun  who had converted to islam in mecca and migrated to medina with muhammad  during muhammad s rule in medina  they were satisfied  and they were glad when muhammad announced that ali would be his successor at the event of ghadir khumm  as they knew that ali would continue muhammad s fair policies towards them 

however  when some of the muhajirun refused to obey muhammad s orders to follow usama bin zayd to syria or to give him pen and paper to make a will  the ansar knew that some of the muhajirun were trying to take power upon muhammad s death  they were worried that the rule of a muhajirun  a foreigner  in their eyes   other than muhammad or ali  ruling over them would lead to their eventual oppression  thus  when they saw some of the muhajirun planning on taking power upon muhammad s death  they thought they would be just as good candidates for power as the muhajirun  thus  when muhammad died  some of the ansar went to a place known as saqifa  where they nominated sa d ibn ubadah to be the leader 

some spies among the ansar informed umar  who had been in medina at the time  about what was happening in saqifa  umar looked for abu bakr  but he was not in medina at the time  he was in suk with his new wife  umar  desperate to prevent the ansar declaring saad ibn ubada to be the caliph  offered to pledge allegiance to abu ubaidah ibn al jarrah  despite the previous pledges of allegiance of the muslims  including umar  to ali   abu ubaidah refused  however  as he believed that abu bakr was more worthy than he was for leadership  desperate to buy time  umar proclaimed that muhammad was not actually dead  he threatened to kill anyone who said otherwise  abu bakr then arrived in medina and calmed umar down  giving a convincing argument that muhammad was dead  abu bakr  umar  and abu ubaidah  leaving the still unburied body of muhammad  then went to saqifa  the meeting in saqifa  which is said to have been attended by fourteen people  took place while ali was performing muhammad s funeral rites 

the ansar and the three muhajirun at saqifa  abu bakr  umar  and abu ubaidah  entered into a length debate about who was more qualified to have leadership  the ansar suggested having two leaders  one from the muhajirun and one from the ansar  while abu bakr stated that the muhajirun should be the leaders and the ansar their ministers  which did not come to fruition   debate continued until it reached a turn when bashir ibn sa ad  an ansar who was jealous of saad ibn ubada  gave a speech supporting abu bakr  umar  and abu ubaidah  abu bakr then told the ansar to pledge allegiance to either umar or abu ubaidah  umar refused and instead pledged allegiance to abu bakr  abu ubaidah and bashir followed umar in doing so 

hubab ibn al mandhir then gave a short speech in which he called bashir  a traitor to  his  own people   after that  a group of bedouin tribesmen arrived  they were opponents of the ansar  and when they saw the three pledges of allegiance to abu bakr  they pledged allegiance to abu bakr as well  the debates between the ansar and the three muhajirun at saqifa was not peaceful  but rather contained violence and even bloodshed  al tabari reported that it was  truly a scene from the period of jahiliya  the pre islamic era   

after assuming the office of caliphate  abu bakr s first address was as follows 

abu bakr s reign lasted for    months  during which he crushed the rebellion of the arab tribes throughout the arabian peninsula in the successful ridda wars  in the last months of his rule  he sent khalid ibn al walid on conquests against the sassanid empire in mesopotamia and against the byzantine empire in syria  this would set in motion a historical trajectory  continued later on by umar and uthman ibn affan  that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history  he had little time to pay attention to the administration of state  though state affairs remained stable during his caliphate  on the advice of umar and abu ubaidah ibn al jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade 

after muhammad s death  apostasy arose in many areas outside medina through the rise of several false prophets  abu bakr sent troops against the claimants and their forces and successfully defeated them  however  the wars against apostasy were expanded to include the use of force against tribes who opposed the rule of abu bakr  one such infamous incident was the massacre of the tribe of banu yerbo  during muhammad s life  malik ibn nuweira was the revenue officer for banu yerbo  he collected tax money from banu yerbo and sent it to medina  upon muhammad s death  however  he stopped collecting taxes and waited to hear how the new government had formed before sending any more money to medina  abu bakr sent a force led by khalid ibn al walid to banu yerbo  khalid killed malik  despite the fact that malik still followed islam and not the false prophets  khalid then  married  malik s widow  less than    hours after malik s death  a practice unacceptable in islam  khalid also killed and captured many  if not all  the other members of banu yerbo  umar demanded that abu bakr dismiss khalid and put him on trial for murder and adultery  but abu bakr reportedly said that khalid had made  an error of judgement  and let him go  another version of the response to khalid s actions claims that khalid did not order malik s execution but that his orders to the guards had been misunderstood  and that abu bakr accepted khalid s excuse 

the ridda wars were over in approximately one year 

after the conclusion of the ridda wars  abu bakr did not want the troops to remain idle  so he launched expeditions into persia and syria  he reportedly assigned amr ibn al aas to palestine and shurahbil ibn hasana and yazid ibn abu sufyan to damascus  abu bakr  however  died before the expeditions into persia and syria were concluded 

on    august      abu bakr fell sick and did not recover  he developed high fever and was confined to bed  his illness was prolonged  and when his condition worsened  he felt that his end was near  realizing his death was near  he sent for ali and requested him to perform his ghusl since ali had also done it for muhammad 

abu bakr felt that he should nominate his successor so that the issue should not be a cause of dissension among the muslims after his death  though there was already controversy over ali not having been appointed 

he appointed umar as his successor after discussing with some companions  some of them favored the nomination and others disliked it  due to the tough nature of umar 

abu bakr thus dictated his last testament to uthman ibn affan as follows 

abu bakr next asked aisha as to how many pieces of cloth were used for muhammad s shroud  aisha said that three pieces had been used  abu bakr thereupon desired the same number for his own shroud  on monday     august      hijri   th of jamadi ui  akhir of the   th ah   abu bakr died  the funeral prayer was led by umar  he was buried the same night by the side of muhammad s grave in aisha s house near al masjid al nabawi

today there are many families which are the descendants of abu bakr  most of them are known by the name siddiqui and al bakri or al sideeqi  al bakri    in arabic    but they are also known by some other names in different localities  for example  in east ethiopia  siddiqis are usually called qallu  which means  people of the religion   as they were the first to bring islam to this area  in somalia  they are commonly known as sheekhaal and they are well respected by other somali clans  in bangladesh  they are known by the name of qureshi  there are also al sedeki or sedeki families in saudi arabia  egypt  syria  yemen  iraq and other places in the arabia peninsula  all the descendants of abu bakr  their ancestors are  abdurahman ibn abu bakr and muhammad ibn abu bakr  the al bakri family in egypt are the descendants of muhammad ibn abu bakr while the sheekhaal or fiqi umar family found in somalia  ethiopia and kenya and the aala bakeri families found in the arabia peninsula are the descendants of abdurahman ibn abu bakr 

though the period of his caliphate covers only two years  two months and fifteen days  it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time  the sassanid empire and byzantine empire 

abu bakr had the distinction of being the first caliph in the history of islam and also the first caliph to nominate a successor  he was the only caliph in the history of islam who refunded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his caliphate 

he is revered for being the first muslim ruler to establish 

he has the distinction of purchasing the land for al masjid al nabawi 

sunni muslims believe that abu bakr is the best man of all the human beings after the prophets  they also consider abu bakr as one of the ten promised paradise   al    ashara al mubashshara   whom muhammad had testified were destined for paradise  he is regarded as the  successor of allah s messenger    khalifa rasulullah    and first of the rightly guided caliphs     i e  rashidun and being the rightful successor to muhammad  abu bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of muhammad throughout his life  he was always there beside muhammad at every major event  it was abu bakr s wisdom that muhammad always honored  abu bakr is regarded to be among best persons from the followers of muhammad  as umar ibn khattab stated that  if the faith of abu bakr was weighed against the faith of the people of the earth  the faith of abu bakr would outweigh the others  

the twelver shia  as the main branch of shia islam  with     of all shias  believe that ali ibn abi talib was supposed to assume the caliphate  and that he had been publicly and unambiguously appointed by muhammad as his successor at ghadir khumm  it is also believed that abu bakr and umar conspired to take over power in the muslim nation after muhammad s death  in a coup d   tat against ali  the twelver shi a do not view abu bakr s being with muhammad in the cave when the two fled mecca as a meritorious act and indeed find significant criticism of abu bakr in the qur anic verse of the cave 

most of twelver shia criticize abu bakr because  after muhammad s death  abu bakr refused to grant muhammad s daughter  fatimah  the lands of the village of fadak which she claimed her father had given to her as a gift before his death  he refused to accept the testimony of her witnesses  so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father  however  abu bakr replied by saying that muhammad had told him that the prophets of god do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of fadak  however  as sayed ali asgher razwy notes in his book  a restatement of the history of islam   muslims   muhammad inherited a maid servant  five camels  and ten sheep  this proves that prophets can receive inheritance  and can pass on inheritance to others as well 

the twelver shia accuse him of participating in the burning of the house of ali and fatima 

the twelver shia believe that abu bakr sent khalid ibn walid to crush those who were in favour of ali s caliphate   see ridda wars    the twelver shia strongly refute the idea that abu bakr or umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the  qur an   claiming that they should have accepted the copy of the book in the possession of ali 

after the death of abu bakr  ali raised muhammad ibn abi bakr  the twelver shia view muhammad ibn abi bakr as one of the companions of ali  when muhammad ibn abi bakr was killed by the ummayads  aisha  the wife of muhammad and also a renowned scholar of her time  raised and taught her nephew qasim ibn muhammad ibn abu bakr  qasim ibn muhammad ibn abu bakr s mother was from ali s family and qasim s daughter farwah bint al qasim was married to muhammad al baqir and was the mother of jafar al sadiq  therefore  qasim ibn muhammad ibn abu bakr was the grand son of abu bakr the first caliph and the grand father of jafar al sadiq  zaydis  the largest group amongst the shia before the safavid dynasty and currently the second largest group  although its population is only about    of all shia muslims   believe that on the last hour of zayd ibn ali  the uncle of jafar al sadiq   he was betrayed by the people in kufa who said to him   may god have mercy on you  what do you have to say on the matter of abu bakr and umar ibn al khattab   zayd ibn ali said   i have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them   when they were entrusted with government they behaved justly with the people and acted according to the qur an and the sunnah

ambrosians

ambrosians are members of one of the religious brotherhoods which at various times since the   th century have sprung up in and around milan and also a   th century sect of anabaptist ambrosians 

only the oldest of the catholic ambrosians  the fratres s  ambrosii ad nemus  had anything more than a very local significance  this order is known from a bull of pope gregory xi addressed to the monks of the church of st ambrose outside milan 

saint ambrose  bishop of milan  certainly did not found religious orders  though he took an interest in the monastic life and watched over its beginnings in his diocese  providing for the needs of a monastery outside the walls of milan  as saint augustine recounts in his  confessions   ambrose also made successful efforts to improve the moral life of women in the milan of his time by promoting the permanent institution of virgins  as also of widows  his exhortations and other interventions have survived in various writings   de virginibus    de viduis    de virginitate    de institutione virginis    de exhortatione virginitatis   and  de lapsu virginis consecratae   ambrose was the only father of the church to leave behind so many writings on the subject and his attentions naturally enough led to the formation of communities which later became formal monasteries of women 

it is against this background that two religious orders or congregations   one of men and one of women  when founded in the milan area during the   th and   th centuries   took saint ambrose as their patron and hence adopted his name 

the first of these groups was formed in a wood outside milan by three noble milanese  alexander grivelli  antonio petrasancta  and albert besuzzi  who were joined by others  including some priests  in      pope gregory xi gave them the rule of st augustine  with set of constitutions  as a canonically recognized order they took the name  fratres sancti ambrosii ad nemus  and adopted a habit consisting of a brown tunic  scapular  and hood  the brethren elected a superior with the title of prior who was then instituted by the archbishop of milan  the priests of the congregation undertook preaching and other tasks of the ministry but were not allowed to accept charge parishes  in the liturgy they followed the ambrosian rite  various monasteries were founded on these lines  but without any formal bond between them  in      pope eugene iv merged them into one congregation called  congregatio sancti ambrosii ad nemus   made the original house the main seat  and laid down a system of government whereby a general chapter met every three years  elected the priors who stayed in office till the next chapter  there was a rector  or superior general  who was assisted by two  visitors  

saint charles borromeo  archbishop of milan  successfully reformed their discipline  grown lax  in       in      pope sixtus v united to the congregation of st ambrose the monasteries of a group known as the  brothers of the apostles of the poor life   or  apostolini  or  brothers of st  barnabas    whose houses were in the province of genoa and in the march of ancona  this was an order that had been founded by giovanni scarpa at the end of the   th century  the union was confirmed by pope paul v in       at which time the congregation added the name of st  barnabas to its title  adopted new constitutions  divided its houses into four provinces  two of them  st clement s and st pancras s  being in rome  published works have survived from the pen of ascanio tasca and michele mulozzani  each of whom was superior general  and of zaccaria visconti  francesco maria guazzi and paolo fabulotti  although various ambrosians were given the title of blessed in recognition of their holiness  antonio gonzaga of mantua  filippo of fermo  and gerardo of monza  the order was eventually dissolved by pope innocent x in      

the nuns of st ambrose  ambrosian sisters  wore a habit of the same colour as the brothers of st ambrose  conformed to their constitutions  and followed the ambrosian rite  but were independent in government  pope sixtus iv gave the nuns canonical status in       their one monastery was on the top of monte varese  near lago maggiore  on the spot where their foundress  the blessed catarina morigia  or catherine of palanza   had first led a solitary life  other early nuns were the blessed juliana of puriselli  benedetta bimia  and lucia alciata  the nuns were esteemed by st charles borromeo 

another group of cloistered  nuns of st ambrose   also called the annunciatae  italian   annunziate   of lombardy or  sisters of st marcellina   were founded in      by three young women of pavia  dorothea morosini  eleonora contarini  and veronica duodi  their houses  scattered throughout lombardy and venetia  were united into a congregation by st pius v  under the rule of st augustine with a mother house  residence of the prioress general  at pavia  one of the nuns in this group was saint catharine fieschi adorno  who died on september          

in some sense also  ambrosians  are the members of a diocesan religious society founded by st charles borromeo  archbishop of milan  all priests or destined to become priests  they took a simple vow of obedience to their bishop  the model for this was a society that already existed at brescia  under the name of  priests of peace   in august      the new society was inaugurated  being entrusted with the church of the holy sepulchre and given the name of  oblates of st  ambrose   they later received the approbation of gregory xiii  st charles died in       these oblates were dispersed by napoleon i in       while another group called the oblates of our lady of rho escaped this fate  in      they were reorganized and given the name of  oblates of st  charles  and reassigned the house of the holy sepulchre  in the course of the   th century similar groups were founded in a number of countries  including the  oblates of st charles   established in london by cardinal nicholas wiseman 





ambrosiaster

ambrosiaster is the name given to the writer of a commentary on st paul s epistles   brief in words but weighty in matter   and valuable for the criticism of the latin text of the new testament  the commentary itself was written during the papacy of pope damasus i  that is  between     and      and is considered an important document of the latin text of paul before the vulgate of jerome  and of the interpretation of paul prior to augustine of hippo 

this commentary was erroneously attributed for a long time to st ambrose  in       though  erasmus threw doubt on the accuracy of ascribing the authorship of this document to ambrose  erasmus is generally falsely credited for having coined the name  ambrosiaster   literally in latin   would be ambrose   to describe its author  the credit for this nickname should go to the maurists  as ren   hoven has shown  the name has remained with the unknown author  attempts to identify this ambrosiaster with known authors has continued  but with no success  because augustine cites ambrosiaster s commentary on romans      under the name of  hilary   many critics have attempted to identify ambroasiaster with one of the many writers named  hilary  active in the period  in       germain morin suggested that the writer was isaac  a converted jew and writer of a tract on the trinity and incarnation  who was exiled to spain in         and then relapsed to judaism  but he afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of decimus hilarianus hilarius  proconsul of africa in      alternatively  paolo angelo ballerini attempted to sustain the traditional attribution of the work to ambrose  in his complete edition of that father s work  this is extremely problematic  though  since it would require ambrose to have written the book before he became a bishop  and then added to it in later years  incorporating later remarks of hilary of poitiers on romans  no identifications  therefore  have acquired lasting popularity with scholars  and his identity remains a mystery 

several other minor works have been attributed to this same author  along with a lengthy collection of exegetical and polemical tractates  the  quaestiones veteris et novi testamenti   which manuscripts have traditionally ascribed to augustine  in       alexander souter established that this work should also be attributed to ambrosiaster  fragments of several other works have been ascribed with some certainty to ambrosiaster  a commentary on matthew     a discussion of the parable of the three measures of flour into which a woman placed yeast  and a treatment of peter s denial and the arrest of jesus in gethsemane  the attribution of other fragments to ambrosiaster  though  is more tentative 

despite the elusive identity of ambrosiaster  several facts about him can be established  internal evidence suggests he was active at rome during the reign of pope damasus              and almost certainly a member of the roman clergy  there are strong indications he objected to jerome s efforts to revise the old latin versions of the gospels  and that he was critical of jerome s activity among ascetic women at rome  ambrosiaster shows a deep interest in judaism and often notes that christian practices derive from jewish tradition 







ambrosius aurelianus

ambrosius aurelianus    anglicised as ambrose aurelian and called aurelius ambrosius in the  historia regum britanniae  and elsewhere  was a war leader of the romano british who won an important battle against the anglo saxons in the  th century  according to gildas  he also appeared independently in the legends of the britons  beginning with the  th century  historia brittonum   eventually he was transformed into the uncle of king arthur  the brother of arthur s father uther pendragon  and predeceases them both 

due to gildas  description of him  ambrosius is one of the figures called the last of the romans 

ambrosius aurelianus is one of the few people that gildas identifies by name in his sermon  de excidio et conquestu britanniae   and the only one named from the  th century   de excidio  is considered the oldest extant british document about the so called arthurian period of sub roman britain  following the destructive assault of the saxons  the survivors gather together under the leadership of ambrosius  who is described as 

some basic information on ambrosius can be deduced from the brief passage  ambrosius was possibly of high birth and very likely a christian  gildas says that he won his battles  with god s help    ambrosius  parents were slain by the saxons and he was among the few survivors of their initial invasion 

according to gildas  ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the saxon invaders  however  this victory was not decisive   sometimes the saxons and sometimes the citizens  meaning the romano british inhabitants  were victorious  

two points in gildas  description have attracted much scholarly commentary  the first is what gildas meant by saying ambrosius  family  had worn the purple   roman emperors and male patricians wore clothes with a purple band to denote their class so the reference to purple may be to an aristocratic heritage  roman military tribunes   tribuni militum    senior officers in roman legions  wore a similar purple band so the reference may be to a family background of military leadership  the tradition was old as the togas and pallia of already ancient senators and tribunes were trimmed with the purple band  in the church  the purple  is a euphemism for blood and therefore  wearing the purple  may be a reference to martyrdom or a bishop s robe  in addition  in the later roman empire both roman consuls and governors of consular rank also wore clothes with a purple fringe  the  notitia dignitatum   a roman catalogue of official posts  lists four or five provincial governors in roman britain and two of them were of consular rank  one was the governor of maxima caesariensis and the other that of valentia  the parent who wore the purple may well have been one of these governors  whose names were not recorded 

it has been suggested by historian alex woolf that ambrosius may have been related to the  th century romano british usurpers marcus or gratian     woolf expresses a preference based on nomenclature for marcus  frank d  reno  an arthurian scholar  has instead argued that the name  aurelianus  indicates the possible descent of ambrosius from the roman emperor lucius domitius aurelianus  aurelian  reigned             aurelian s military campaigns included the conquest of the gallic empire  n  j  higham suggests that ambrosius may have been distantly related to imperial families of the late roman empire  such as the theodosian dynasty  branches of this particular dynasty were known to be active in western roman provinces like hispania 

mike ashley instead focuses on the name  ambrosius   in his view  it seems to suggest connection to saint ambrosius  a fourth century bishop of milan  who also served as consular governor in areas of roman italy  the father of the bishop is sometimes claimed to be a fourth century praetorian prefect of gaul named aurelius ambrosius  whose areas included britain  though some modern scholars doubt that saint ambrosius was related to this man  instead identifying his father with an official named uranius mentioned in an extract from the theodosian code   ashley suggests that ambrosius aurelianus was related to the two aurelii ambrosii  tim venning points out that the name  aurelianus  could be the result of a roman adoption  when a boy was adopted into a new gens  clan   he received the family names of his new family  plus an additional cognomen indicating his descent from his original gens family  the additional cognomen often had the form   anus   when gaius octavius from gens octavia was adopted into the julii caesares family  his new name became gaius julius caesar octavianus  in this case  ambrosius may have been a member of gens aurelia who was adopted by another gens family  his original name aurelius became aurelianus 

the second question is the meaning of the word  avita   gildas could have meant  ancestors   or intended it to mean more specifically  grandfather      thus indicating ambrosius lived about a generation before the battle of badon  lack of information prevents sure answers to these questions 

n  j  higham wrote a book on gildas and the literary tropes that he used  he has suggested that gildas may have had considerable motive for drawing attention to ambrosius  he was not attempting to write a historical biography of the man  according to higham  but setting him as an example to his contemporaries  it was essential to the philosophy of gildas that briton leaders who achieved victory over the barbarians were only able to do so because of divine aid  and only those who had superior christian virtues were deserving of this aid  ambrosius aurelianus was apparently known for at least one such victory over the barbarians  in order to fit him in his worldview  gildas was almost required to feature the former warrior as a man of exceptional virtues and obedience to god  he was made to fit gildas  version of a model leader 

higham also suggests that the roman lineage of ambrosius was highlighted for a reason  gildas was apparently intentionally connecting him with the legitimate authority and military virtues of the romans  he was also contrasting him with the subsequent briton rulers whose reigns lacked in such legitimacy 

gildas is a primary source for the battle of badon  yet he never mentions the names of the combatants  therefore  we cannot know if ambrosius aurelianus or his successors took part in the battle  the names of the saxon leaders in the battle are also not recorded 

the identities of ambrosius  descendants are unknown  since gildas never identifies them by name  it is safe to assume that they were gildas  contemporaries and known to the author  higham suggests that they were prominent figures of the time  their lineage and identities were probably sufficiently familiar to his intended audience that they did not have to be named  the work portrays ambrosius  descendants as inferior to their ancestor as part of his criticism on rulers of his time  according to higham  those criticized were likely aware that the vitriol was intended for them  but probably would not challenge a work offering such a glowing report of their illustrious ancestor 

mike ashley suggests that the descendants of ambrosius could include other people named by gildas  he favors the inclusion in this category of one aurelius caninus   aurelius the little dog  or  aurelius the whelp    whom gildas accuses of parricide  fornication  adultery  and warmongering  his name  aurelius  suggests romano british descent  the insulting nickname  caninus  was probably invented by gildas himself  who similarly insults other contemporary rulers  due to the name used by gildas  there are theories that this ruler was actually named conan cynan kenan  some identify him with cynan garwyn  a  th century king of powys  though it is uncertain if he was a contemporary of gildas or lived one or two generations following him  another theory is that this ruler did not reign in britain but in brittany  caninus  in this view  might be conomor   great dog    conomor is considered a likelier contemporary of gildas  conomor was likely from domnon  e  an area of brittany controlled by british immigrants from dumnonia  he might be remembered in british legend as mark of cornwall 

gildas primarily features the saxons as barbarian raiders  their invasions involved a slow and difficult process of military conquest  by ad      possibly the time described by gildas  anglo saxons controlled the isle of wight  kent  lincolnshire  norfolk  suffolk  and coastal areas of northumberland and yorkshire  the rest of the former roman britain was still under the control of the local britons  gildas also mentions depopulation of cities and this probably reflects historical facts  londinium  once a major city  was completely abandoned during the  th century 

bede follows gildas  account of ambrosius in his  ecclesiastical history of the english people   but in his  chronica majora  he dates ambrosius  victory to the reign of the emperor zeno             

bede s treatment of the  th century history of great britain is not particularly valuable as a source  until about the year      bede could choose between several historical sources and often followed the writings of orosius  following the end of orosius  history  bede apparently lacked other available sources and relied extensively on gildas  entries from this period tend to be close paraphrases of gildas  account with mostly stylistic changes  bede s account of ambrosius aurelianus has been translated as following 

bede does not mention the descendants of ambrosius aurelianus  nor their supposed degeneracy 

the  historia brittonum   attributed to nennius  preserves several snippets of lore about ambrosius  despite the traditional attribution  the authorship of the work and the period of its writing are open questions for modern historians  there are several extant manuscript versions of the work  varying in details  the most important ones have been dated to between the  th and the   th century  some modern scholars think it unlikely that the work was composed by a single writer or compiler  suggesting that it may have taken centuries to reach its final form  though this theory is not conclusive 

in chapter     we are told that vortigern ruled in fear of ambrosius  this is the first mention of ambrosius in the work  according to frank d  reno  this would indicate that ambrosius  influence was formidable  since vortigern considered him more of a threat than northern invaders and attempts to restore roman rule in britain  the chapter relates events following the end of roman rule in britain and preceding vortigern s alliance with the saxons 

the most significant appearance of ambrosius is the story about ambrosius  vortigern  and the two dragons beneath dinas emrys   fortress of ambrosius  in chapters          in this account  ambrosius is still an adolescent but has supernatural powers  he intimidates vortigern and the royal magicians  when it is revealed that ambrosius is the son of a roman consul  vortigern is convinced to cede to the younger man the castle of dinas emrys and all the kingdoms in the western part of britain  vortigern then retreats to the north  in an area called gwynessi  this story was later retold with more detail by geoffrey of monmouth in his fictionalized  historia regum britanniae   conflating the personage of ambrosius with the welsh tradition of myrddin the visionary  known for oracular utterances that foretold the coming victories of the native celtic inhabitants of britain over the saxons and the normans  geoffrey also introduces him into the  historia  under the name aurelius ambrosius as one of three sons of constantine iii  along with constans ii and uther pendragon 

in chapter     ambrosius aurelianus is described as  king among all the kings of the british nation   the chapter records that pascent  the son of vortigern  was granted rule over the regions of buellt and gwrtheyrnion by ambrosius  finally  in chapter     various events are dated from a battle of guoloph  often identified with wallop  ese of amesbury near salisbury   which is said to have been between ambrosius and vitolinus  the author dates this battle as taking place    years from the reign of vortigern 

it is not clear how these various traditions about ambrosius relate to each other  or whether they come from the same tradition  it is very possible that these references are to different men with the same name  frank d  reno points out that the works call all these men  ambrosius   emrys   the cognomen  aurelianus  is never used  the  historia brittonum  dates the battle of guoloph to  the twelfth year of vortigern   by which the year     seems to be meant  this is perhaps a generation before the battle that gildas says was commanded by ambrosius aurelianus 

the text never identifies who ambrosius s father is  just gives his title as a roman consul  when an adolescent ambrosius speaks of his father  there is no suggestion that this father is deceased  the boy is not identified as an orphan  the exact age of ambrosius is not given in his one encounter with vortigern  frank d  reno suggests that he might be as young as    years old  barely a teenager 

it is impossible to know to what degree ambrosius actually wielded political power  and over what area  ambrosius and vortigern are shown as being in conflict in the  historia brittonum   and some historians have suspected that this preserves a historical core of the existence of two parties in opposition to one another  one headed by ambrosius and the other by vortigern  j  n  l  myres built upon this suspicion and speculated that belief in pelagianism reflected an actively provincial outlook in britain and that vortigern represented the pelagian party  while ambrosius led the catholic one  subsequent historians accepted myers  speculation as fact  creating a narrative of events in  th century britain with various degrees of elaborate detail  yet a simpler alternative interpretation of the conflict between these two figures is that the  historia brittonum  is preserving traditions hostile to the purported descendants of vortigern  who at this time were a ruling house in powys  this interpretation is supported by the negative character of all of the stories retold about vortigern in the  historia brittonum   which include his alleged practice of incest 

the identity is somewhat obscure of ambrosius  last mentioned enemy vitalinus  various manuscripts of the  historia  and translations render his name  guitolin    guitolini    guitholini   and  vitalinus   he is mentioned in chapter    as one of four sons of gloiu and co founder of the city of gloucester  no other background information is given  there are theories that gloiu is also the father of vortigern  but the genealogy is obscure and no supporting primary text can be found  there have been further attempts to identify vitalinus with a pro vortigern or anti roman faction in britain  opposed to the rise of the romano british ambrosius  however  this is rendered problematic since vitalinus seems to also have a romano british name  the traditional view of pro roman and pro briton factions active in this period might oversimplify a more complex situation 

ambrosius appears briefly in the  gesta regum anglorum    deeds of the kings of the english   by william of malmesbury  despite its name  the work attempted to reconstruct british history in general by drawing together the varying accounts of gildas  bede  nennius  and various chroniclers  the work features ambrosius as the apparent employer of arthur  the relative passage has been translated as following 

william swiftly shifts attention from ambrosius to arthur  and proceeds to narrate arthur s supposed victory in the battle of badon  the narrative is probably the first to connect ambrosius and arthur  william had to reconcile the accounts of gildas and bede who implied that ambrosius was connected to the battle  and that of nennius which clearly stated that it was arthur who was connected to the battle  he solved the apparent discrepancy by connecting both of them to it  ambrosius as the king of the britons and arthur as his most prominent general and true victor of the battle 

ambrosius aurelianus appears in later pseudo chronicle tradition beginning with geoffrey of monmouth s  historia regum britanniae  with the slightly garbled name  aurelius ambrosius   now presented as son of a king constantine  king constantine s eldest son constans is murdered at vortigern s instigation  and the two remaining sons  ambrosius and uther  still very young  are quickly hustled into exile in brittany   this does not fit with gildas  account  in which ambrosius  family perished in the turmoil of the saxon uprisings   later  the two brothers return from exile with a large army when vortigern s power has faded  they destroy vortigern and become friends with merlin  they go on to defeat the saxon leader hengist in two battles at maisbeli  probably ballifield  near sheffield  and cunengeburg  hengist is executed and ambrosius becomes king of britain  however  he is poisoned by his enemies  and uther succeeds him  the text identifies the poisoner as eopa 

judgements tend to vary wildly of the value of geoffrey as both a historian and a literary storyteller  he has been praised for giving us detailed information about an otherwise obscure period and possibly preserving information from lost sources  and condemned for an excessive use of artistic license and possibly inventing stories wholecloth  

geoffrey changed the word  aurelianus  to  aurelius   which is the name of a roman gens  geoffrey retains the story of emrys and the dragons from nennius  but identifies the figure with merlin  merlin is geoffrey s version of a historical figure known as myrddin wyllt  myrddin is only mentioned once in the  annales cambriae   at an entry dated to      the name of merlin is given in latin as ambrosius merlinus   merlinus  may have been intended as the agnomen of a roman or romano british individual like ambrosius 

elements of ambrosius aurelianus  the traditional warrior king  are used by geoffrey for other characters  ambrosius  supposed supernatural powers are passed to merlin  geoffrey s aurelius ambrosius rises to the throne but dies early  passing the throne to a previously unknown brother called uther pendragon  the role of warrior king is shared by uther and his son arthur 

geoffrey also uses the character gloiu  father of vitalinus vitolinus  derived from nennius  he names this character as a son of claudius and appointed by his father as duke of the welsh  his predecessor as duke is called arvirargus  assuming that claudius and arvirargus are supposed to be contemporaries  then this claudius is the roman emperor claudius i  reigned           it seems unlikely that claudius would have living grandsons in the  th century  four centuries following his death  reno suggests that claudius ii  reigned            would be a more likely  claudius  to have living descendants in the  th century 

geoffrey for the first time gives a genealogy of ambrosius  he is supposedly a paternal nephew of aldroenus  king of brittany  son of constantine and an unnamed briton noblewoman  adoptive grandson  on his mother s side  of guthelinus vitalinus  bishop of london  younger brother of constans and older brother of uther pendragon  ambrosius and uther are supposedly raised by their adoptive maternal grandfather guthelinus vitalinus  it is not explicitly covered in geoffrey s narrative  but this genealogy makes constantine and his children descendants of conan meriadoc  legendary founder of the line of kings of brittany  conan is also featured in the  historia regum britanniae   where he is appointed king by roman emperor magnus maximus  reigned            

constantine s reign is placed by geoffrey as following the groans of the britons mentioned by gildas  constantine is reported killed by a pict and his reign is followed by a brief succession crisis  candidates for the throne included all three sons of constantine  but there were problems for their eventual rise to the throne  constans was a monk  and ambrosius and uther were underage and still in their cradle  the crisis is resolved when vortigern places constans on the throne  and then serves as his chief adviser and power behind the throne  when constans is killed by the picts serving as bodyguards of vortigern  vortigern feigns anguish and has the killers executed  ambrosius is still underage and vortigern rises to the throne 

the chronology offered by geoffrey for the early life of ambrosius contradicts gildas and nennius  and is also internally inconsistent  the groans of the britons involves an appeal by the britons to roman consul  agitius   this person has been identified with flavius aetius  d        magister militum   master of soldiers   of the western roman empire and consul of the year      the groans are generally dated to the    s and    s  preceding the death of aetius  if geoffrey s constantine rose to the throne immediately following the groans  this would place his reign in this period  geoffrey gives a    year reign for constantine and his marriage lasts just as long  however the eldest son constans is clearly older than    years by the time his father dies  he is already an adult candidate of the throne and has had time to follow a monastic career  even assuming there is a time gap between the death of constantine and the adulthood of constans  his younger brothers 
have not aged at all in the narrative 
geoffrey s narrative has an underage ambrosius  if not a literal infant  in the    s  accounts deriving from gildas and nennius place ambrosius in the prime of his life in the same decade  most telling is that geoffrey has vortigern rising to the throne in the    s  nennius places the rise of vortigern in the year      and vortigern is entirely absent in chronologies of the    s  suggesting that he was deceased by that time 

geoffrey s narrative includes as a major character hengist  as leader of the saxons  he is featured as the father of queen rowena and father in law of vortigern  other saxon characters in the narrative tend to receive less attention by the writer  but their names tend to correspond to anglo saxons known from other sources  henginst s supposed son octa is apparently octa of kent  a  th century ruler variously connected to hengist as a son or descendant  the other son  ebissa  is more difficult to identify  he might correspond to kinsmen of hengist variously identified as  ossa    oisc   and  aesc   a minor saxon character called  cherdic  is probably cerdic of wessex  though elsewhere geoffrey calls the same king  cheldric   he actually may appear under three different names in the narrative  since geoffrey elsewhere calls the interpreter of hengist  ceretic   a variant of the same name 

geoffrey  in the last chapters featuring vortigern  has the king served by magicians  this detail derives from nennius  though nennius was talking about vortigern s  wise men   they may not have been magic users but advisers  vortigern s encounter with emrys merlin takes place in this part of the narrative  merlin warns vortigern that ambrosius and uther have already sailed for britain and are soon to arrive  apparently to claim his throne  ambrosius soon arrives at the head of the army and is crowned king  he besieges vortigern at the castle of  genoreu   which is identified with nennius   cair guorthigirn    fort vortigern   and the hillfort at little doward  ambrosius burns the castle down and vortigern dies with it 

having killed vortigern  ambrosius next turns his attention to hengist  despite the fact that no earlier military actions of ambrosius are recorded  the saxons have already heard of his bravery and battle prowess  they immediately retreat beyond the humber  hengist soon amasses a massive army to face ambrosius  his army counts         men and ambrosius  only        men  he marches south and the first battle between the two armies takes place in maisbeli  where ambrosius emerges the victor  it is unclear what location geoffrey had in mind  maisbeli translates to  the field of beli   and could be related to the beli mawr of welsh legend and or the celtic god belenus  alternatively it could be a field where the beltane festival was celebrated  geoffrey could derive the name from a similar sounding toponym  for example  meicen of the hen ogledd   old north    traditionally identified with hatfield 

following his defeat  hengist retreats towards cunungeburg  geoffrey probably had in mind conisbrough  not far from hatfield  ambrosius leads his army against the new position of the saxons  the second battle is more evenly fought  and hengist has a chance to achieve victory  however  ambrosius receives reinforcements from brittany and the tide of the battle turns in favor of the britons  hengist himself is captured by his old enemy eldol  consul of gloucester and decapitated  soon after the battle  the surviving saxon leaders octa and eosa submit themselves to ambrosius  rule  he pardons them and grants them an area near scotland  the area is not named  but geoffrey could be basing this on bernicia  a real ango saxon kingdom covering areas in the modern borders of scotland and england 

geoffrey closely connects the deaths of vortigern and hengist  which are elsewhere poorly recorded  vortigern historically died in the    s  and various dates for the death of hengist have been proposed  between the    s and the    s  octa of kent  the supposed son and heir of hengist  was still alive in the  th century and seems to belong to a later historical era than his father  the ruling family of the kingdom of kent were called the oiscingas  a term identifying them as descendants of oisc of kent  not of hengist  in effect  none of them was likely a literal son of hengist and their relation to hengist may have been a later invention  geoffrey did not invent the connection  but his sources here were likely legendary in nature 

following his victories and the end of the wars  ambrosius organizes the burial of killed nobles at kaercaradduc  geoffrey identifies this otherwise unknown location with caer caradog  salisbury   ambrosius wants a permanent memorial for the slain and assigns the task to merlin  the result is the so called giants  ring  its location in the vicinity of salisbury has led to its identification with stonehenge  though geoffrey never uses that term  stonehenge is closer to amesbury than salisbury  the ring formation of the monument could equally apply to avebury  the largest stone circle in europe 

in welsh legend and texts  ambrosius appears as  emrys wledig   emperor ambrose   the term  wledig  is a title used by senior royal and military commanders who have achieved notable success  the term is mostly used for famous figures such as cunedda  though a few obscure figures have been given the title 

in robert de boron s  merlin  he is called simply  pendragon  and his younger brother is named  uter   which he changes to  uterpendragon  after the death of the elder sibling  this is probably a confusion that entered oral tradition from wace s  roman de brut   wace usually only refers to  li roi    the king   without naming him  and someone has taken an early mention of uther s epithet  pendragon  as the name of his brother 

l  on fleuriot has suggested ambrosius is identical to riothamus  a brythonic leader who fought a major battle against the goths in france around the year      fleuriot argues that ambrosius led the britons in the battle  in which he was defeated and forced to retreat to burgundy  fleuriot proposed that he then returned to britain to continue the war against the saxons 

it has been suggested that the place name amesbury in wiltshire might preserve the name of ambrosius  and that perhaps amesbury was the seat of his power base in the later fifth century  scholars such as shimon applebaum have found a number of place names through the midland dialect regions of britain that incorporate the  ambre   element  examples include ombersley in worcestershire  ambrosden in oxfordshire  amberley in herefordshire  amberley in gloucestershire  and amberley in west sussex  these scholars have claimed that this element represents an old english word  amor   the name of a woodland bird  however  amesbury in wiltshire is in a different dialect region and does not easily fit into the pattern of the midland dialect place names 

the novel  coalescent  by stephen baxter depicts aurelianus as a general to artorius  briton and basis for the legend of king arthur  in baxter s novel  aurelianus is a minor character who interacts with the book s main roman era protagonist  regina  founder of a  literally  underground matriarchal society  in the text  he is credited with winning the battle of mount badon 

in marion zimmer bradley s  the mists of avalon   aurelianus is depicted as the aging high king of britain  a  too ambitious  son of a western roman emperor  his sister s son is uther pendragon  but uther is described as not having any roman blood  aurelianus is unable to gather the leadership of the native celts  who refuse to follow any but their own race

mary stewart s  the crystal cave  follows geoffrey of monmouth in calling him aurelius ambrosius and portrays him as the father of merlin  the elder brother of uther  hence uncle of arthur   an initiate of mithras  and generally admired by everyone except the saxons  much of the book is set at his court in brittany or during the campaign to retake his throne from vortigern  later books in the series show that merlin s attitude toward arthur is influenced by his belief that arthur is a reincarnation of ambrosius  who is seen through merlin s eyes as a model of good kingship

ammon

ammon      was an ancient semitic speaking nation occupying the east of the jordan river  between the torrent valleys of arnon and jabbok  in present day jordan  the chief city of the country was  rabbah  or  rabbath ammon   site of the modern city of amman  jordan s capital  milcom and molech  who may be one and the same  are named in the hebrew bible as the gods of ammon  the people of this kingdom are called  children of ammon  or  ammonites  

the ammonites occupied the northern central trans jordanian plateau from the latter part of the second millennium bc to at least the second century ce 

ammon maintained its independence from the assyrian empire through tribute to the assyrian king  at a time when nearby kingdoms were being raided or conquered  inscriptions describe the ammonite king baasha ben ruhubi s army fighting alongside ahab of israel and syrian allies against shalmaneser iii at the battle of qarqar in     bc  possibly as vassals of hadadezer  the aramaean king of damascus  in     bc the ammonite king sanipu was a vassal of tiglath pileser iii  and sanipu s successor pudu ilu held the same position under sennacherib and esarhaddon  an assyrian tribute list exists from this period  showing that ammon paid one fifth as much tribute as judah did 

somewhat later  the ammonite king amminadab i was among the tributaries who suffered in the course of the great arabian campaign of assurbanipal  other kings attested to in contemporary sources are barachel  attested to in several contemporary seals  and hissalel  the latter of whom reigned about     bce  hissalel is mentioned in an inscription on a bottle found at tel siran  jordan along with his son  king amminadab ii  who reigned around     bce 

archaeology and history indicate that ammon flourished during the neo babylonian empire period  this contradicts the view  dominant for decades  that transjordan was either destroyed by nebuchadnezzar ii  or suffered a rapid decline following judah s destruction by that king  newer evidence suggests that ammon enjoyed continuity from the neo babylonian to the persian period 

little mention is made of the ammonites through the persian and early hellenistic periods  their name appears  however  during the time of the maccabees  the ammonites  with some of the neighboring tribes  did their utmost to resist and check the revival of the jewish power under judas maccabaeus  the hasmonean dynast hyrcanus founded qasr al abd  and was a descendant of the seleucid tobiad dynasty of tobiah  who is mentioned by nehemiah as an ammonite  ii      from the east jordanian district 

the last notice of the ammonites is in justin martyr s  dialogue with trypho            in the second century  where it is affirmed that they were still a numerous people 

the first mention of the ammonites in the bible is in   it is stated there that they descended from ben ammi  a son of lot through with his younger daughter who plotted with her sister to intoxicate lot and in his inebriated state  have relations to become pregnant  ben ammi literally means   son of my people    after the destruction of sodom and gomorrah  the daughters of lot wanted to have a child and carried out a plot to intoxicate him and had relations  resulting in ammon and his half brother  moab  being conceived and born  this narrative has traditionally been considered literal fact  but is now generally interpreted as recording a gross popular irony by which the israelites expressed their loathing of the morality of the moabites and ammonites  although it is doubtful that the israelites would have directed such irony to lot himself 

the ammonites settled to the east of the jordan  invading the rephaim lands east of jordan  between the jabbok and arnon  dispossessing them and dwelling in their place  their territory originally comprising all from the jordan to the wilderness  and from the river jabbok south to the river arnon  it was accounted a land of giants  and that giants formerly dwelt in it  whom the ammonites called zamzummim 

shortly before the israelite exodus  the amorites west of jordan  under king sihon  invaded and occupied a large portion of the territory of moab and ammon  the ammonites were driven from the rich lands near the jordan and retreated to the mountains and valleys to the east  the invasion of the amorites created a wedge and separated the two kingdoms of ammon and moab 

throughout the bible  the ammonites and israelites are portrayed as mutual antagonists  during the exodus  the israelites were prohibited by the ammonites from passing through their lands  the ammonites soon allied themselves with eglon of moab in attacking israel 

the ammonites maintained their claim to part of transjordan  after it was occupied by the israelites who obtained it from sihon  during the days of jephthah  the ammonites occupied the lands east of the river jordan and started to invade israelite lands west of the river  jephthah became the leader in resisting these incursions 

the constant harassment of the israelite communities east of the jordan by the ammonites was the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under saul  king nahash of ammon      bc  lay siege to jabesh gilead  eventually this led to an alliance with saul and the israelites  led by saul relieved the siege and defeated the ammonite king  eventually resulting in the formation of the israelite kingdom 

during the reign of king david  the ammonites humiliated david s messengers  and hired the aramean armies to attack israel  this eventually ended in a war and a year long siege of rabbah  the capital of ammon  the war ended with all the ammonite cities being conquered and plundered  and the inhabitants being killed or put to forced labor at david s command 

when the arameans of damascus city state deprived the kingdom of israel of their possessions east of the jordan  the ammonites became allies of ben hadad  and a contingent of       of them served as allies of syria in the great battle of the arameans and assyrians at qarqar in     bc in the reign of shalmaneser iii 

the ammonites  moabites and meunim formed a coalition against jehoshaphat of judah  the coalition later was thrown to confusion  with the armies slaughtering one another  they were subdued and paid tribute to jotham 

after submitting to tiglath pileser they were generally tributary to assyria  but have joined in the general uprising that took place under sennacherib  but they submitted and they became tributary in the reign of esar haddon  their hostility to judah is shown in their joining the chaldeans to destroy it    kings        their cruelty is denounced by the prophet amos
 amos        and their destruction  with their return in the future  by jeremiah  jeremiah            ezekiel  ezekiel              and zechariah  zechariah          their murder of gedaliah    kings             jeremiah        was a dastardly act  they may have regained their old territory when tiglath pileser carried off the israelites east of the jordan into captivity    kings          chronicles       

tobiah the ammonite united with sanballat to oppose nehemiah  nehemiah     and their opposition to the jews did not cease with the establishment of the latter in judea 

they also joined the syrians in their wars with the maccabees and were defeated by judas 

according to both and   naamah was an ammonite  she was the only wife of king solomon to be mentioned by name in the tanakh as having borne a child  she was the mother of solomon s successor  rehoboam 

the ammonites presented a serious problem to the pharisees because many marriages between israelite men and ammonite  and moabite  women had taken place in the days of nehemiah  the men had married women of the various nations without conversion  which made the children not jewish  the legitimacy of david s claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from ruth  the moabite 

the few ammonite names that have been preserved also include nahash and hanun  both from the bible  the ammonites  language is believed to be in the canaanite family  closely related to hebrew and moabite  ammonite may have incorporated certain aramaic influences  including the use of     bd   instead of commoner biblical hebrew       h   for  work   the only other notable difference with biblical hebrew is the sporadic retention of feminine singular   t   e g           t   cistern   but     lyh   high  fem     

the economy  for the most part  was based on agriculture and herding  most people lived in small villages surrounded by farms and pastures  like its sister kingdom of moab  ammon was the source of numerous natural resources  including sandstone and limestone  it had a productive agricultural sector and occupied a vital place along the king s highway  the ancient trade route connecting egypt with mesopotamia  syria  and asia minor  as with the edomites and moabites  trade along this route gave them considerable revenue  circa     bce ammon showed rising prosperity  due to agriculture and trade  and built a series of fortresses  its capital was located in what is now the citadel of amman 

in       during the excavations of a site called tell siran in north west amman  an inscription on a bronze bottle of about     cm tall was found  scientific investigation has showed that the inscription dates back to     bc  and later concluded that it was a lyric poem written in ammonite language  the poem talks about a drinking song  roughly translated to

ammonius hermiae

ammonius hermiae     amm  nios ho hermeiou     was a greek philosopher  and the son of the neoplatonist philosophers hermias and aedesia  he was a pupil of proclus in athens  and taught at alexandria for most of his life  writing commentaries on plato  aristotle  and other philosophers 

ammonius  father  hermias  died when he was a child  and his mother  aedesia  raised him and his brother  heliodorus  in alexandria  when they reached adulthood  aedesia accompanied her sons to athens where they studied under proclus  eventually  they returned to alexandria  where ammonius  as head of the neoplatonist school in alexandria  lectured on plato and aristotle for the rest of his life  according to damascius  during the persecution of the pagans at alexandria in the late    s  ammonius made concessions to the christian authorities so that he could continue his lectures  damascius  who scolds ammonius for the agreement that he made  does not say what the concessions were  but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote  he was still teaching in      olympiodorus heard him lecture on plato s  gorgias  in that year  he also taught asclepius of tralles  john philoponus  damascius and simplicius 
he was also an accomplished astronomer  he lectured on ptolemy and is known to have written a treatise on the astrolabe 

of his reputedly numerous writings  only his commentary on aristotle s  de interpretatione  survives intact  a commentary on porphyry s  isagoge  may also be his  but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations 

in  de interpretatione   ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent  like
bo  thius in his second  commentary  and  the consolation of philosophy   this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer  ammonius cites iamblichus who said  knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known  since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known  

in addition  there are some notes of ammonius  lectures written by various students which also survive 


there is greek language work called  life of aristotle   which is usually ascribed to ammonius  but  is more probable that it is the work of joannes philoponus  the pupil of ammonius  to whom it is ascribed in some mss  







ammonius saccas

ammonius saccas      fl   rd century ad  was a greek philosopher from alexandria who was often referred to as one of the founders of neoplatonism  he is mainly known as the teacher of plotinus  whom he taught for eleven years from     to      he was undoubtedly the biggest influence on plotinus in his development of neoplatonism  although little is known about his own philosophical views  later christian writers stated that ammonius was a christian  but it is now generally assumed that there was a different ammonius of alexandria who wrote biblical texts 

his father hermeias came from alexandria  and ammonius inherited the chair of philosophy at alexandria from him  damascius   history  is considered the source containing most details about ammonius  life  his cognomen  sakkas  has been interpreted to indicate that he was a porter in his youth 

most details of his life come from the fragments left from porphyry s writings  the most famous pupil of ammonius saccas was plotinus who studied under ammonius for eleven years  according to porphyry  in      at the age of     plotinus went to alexandria to study philosophy 
in his twenty eighth year he  plotinus  felt the impulse to study philosophy and was recommended to the teachers in alexandria who then had the highest reputation  but he came away from their lectures so depressed and full of sadness that he told his trouble to one of his friends  the friend  understanding the desire of his heart  sent him to ammonius  whom he had not so far tried  he went and heard him  and said to his friend   this is the man i was looking for   from that day he stayed continually with ammonius and acquired so complete a training in philosophy that he became eager to make acquaintance with the persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the indians 

according to porphyry  the parents of ammonius were christians  but upon learning greek philosophy  ammonius rejected his parents  religion for paganism  this conversion is contested by the christian writers jerome and eusebius  who state that ammonius remained a christian throughout his lifetime 

 porphyry  plainly utters a falsehood  for what will not an opposer of christians do   when he says that     ammonius fell from a life of piety into heathen customs      ammonius held the divine philosophy unshaken and unadulterated to the end of his life  his works yet extant show this  as he is celebrated among many for the writings which he has left 

however  we are told by longinus that ammonius wrote nothing  and if ammonius was the principal influence on plotinus  then it is unlikely that ammonius would have been a christian  one way to explain much of the confusion concerning ammonius is to assume that there were two people called ammonius  ammonius saccas who taught plotinus  and an ammonius the christian who wrote biblical texts  another explanation might be that there was only one ammonius but that origen  who found the neo platonist views of his teacher essential to his own beliefs about the essential nature of christianity  chose to suppress ammonius  choice of paganism over christianity  the insistence of eusebius  origen s pupil  and jerome  all of whom were recognized fathers of the christian church  that ammonius saccas had not rejected his christian roots would be easier for christians to accept than the assertion of prophyry  who was a pagan  that ammonius had chosen paganism over christianity 

to add to the confusion  it seems that ammonius had two pupils called origen  origen the christian  and origen the pagan  it is quite possible that ammonius saccas taught both origens  and since there were two origens who were accepted as contemporaries it was easy for later christians to accept that there were two individuals named ammonius  one a christian and one a pagan  among ammonius  other pupils there were herennius and cassius longinus 

hierocles  writing in the  th century  states that ammonius  fundamental doctrine was that plato and aristotle were in full agreement with each other 
he was the first who had a godly zeal for the truth in philosophy and despised the views of the majority  which were a disgrace to philosophy  he apprehended well the views of each of the two philosophers  plato and aristotle  and brought them under one and the same  nous  and transmitted philosophy without conflicts to all of his disciples  and especially to the best of those acquainted with him  plotinus  origen  and their successors 

according to nemesius  a bishop and neoplatonist c       ammonius held that the soul was immaterial 

little is known about ammonius s role in the development of neoplatonism  porphyry seems to suggest that ammonius was instrumental in helping plotinus think about philosophy in new ways 
but he  plotinus  did not just speak straight out of these books but took a distinctive personal line in his consideration  and brought the mind of ammonius  to bear on the investigation in hand 
two of ammonius s students   origen the pagan  and longinus   seem to have held philosophical positions which were closer to middle platonism than neoplatonism  which perhaps suggests that ammonius s doctrines were also closer to those of middle platonism than the neoplatonism developed by plotinus  see the enneads   but plotinus does not seem to have thought that he was departing in any significant way from that of his master 







book of amos

the book of amos is the third of the twelve minor prophets in the tanakh old testament and the second in the greek septuagint tradition  amos  an older contemporary of hosea and isaiah  was active c      bc during the reign of jeroboam ii            bc   making the book of amos the first biblical book in the section of the prophets written  amos lived in the kingdom of judah but preached in the northern kingdom of israel  his major themes of social justice  god s omnipotence  and divine judgment became staples of prophecy 


the book opens with a historical note about the prophet  then a short oracle announcing yahweh s judgment  repeated in the book of joel   the prophet denounces the crimes against humanity committed by the gentile nations  tells israel that even they have sinned and are guilty of the same crimes  and report five symbolic visions prophesying the destruction of israel  included in this  with no apparent order  are an oracle on the nature of prophecy  snippets of hymns  oracles of woe  a third person prose narrative concerning the prophet  and an oracle promising restoration of the house of david  which had not yet fallen in amos s lifetime 

amos prophesied during the reign of jeroboam ii  king of israel  and of uzziah of judah  which places him in the first half of the  th century bc  according to the book s superscription  amos      he was from tekoa  a town in judah south of jerusalem  but his prophetic mission was in the northern kingdom  he is called a  shepherd  and a  dresser of sycamore trees   but the book s literary qualities suggest a man of education rather than a poor farmer 

scholars have long recognized that amos utilized an ancient hymn within his prophecy  verses of which are found at                              this hymn is best understood as praising yhwh for his judgment  demonstrated in his destructive power  rather than praise for creation  scholarship has also identified  sumerian city lament   scl  motifs within amos and particularly the hymn  offering the possibility that amos used scl as a literary template for his prophecy of jerusalem s destruction  the amos hymn has also been discussed in terms of a  covenant curse  which was used to warn israel of the consequences of breaking the covenant  and in particular a  flood covenant curse  motif  first identified by d r  hillers  recent scholarship has shown amos s hymn is an ancient narrative text  has identified a new verse at      and has compared the hymn to the genesis flood account and job          

the central idea of the book of amos is that god puts his people on the same level as the surrounding nations     god expects the same purity of them all  as it is with all nations that rise up against the kingdom of god  even israel and judah will not be exempt from the judgment of god because of their idolatry and unjust ways  the nation that represents yhwh must be made pure of anything or anyone that profanes the name of god  god s name must be exalted 

amos is the first prophet to use the term  the day of the lord  this phrase becomes important within future prophetic and apocalyptic literature  for the people of israel  the day of the   is the day when god will fight against his and their enemies  and it will be a day of victory for israel  however  amos and other prophets include israel as an enemy of god  as israel is guilty of injustice toward the innocent  poor  and young women  to amos  the day of the lord  will be a day of doom 

other major ideas in the book of amos include  social justice and concern for the disadvantaged  the idea that israel s covenant with god did not exempt them from accountability for sin  god is god of all nations  god is judge of all nations  god is god of moral righteousness  god made all people  god elected israel and then liberated israel so that he would be known throughout the world  election by god means that those elected are responsible to live according to the purposes clearly outlined to them in the covenant  if god destroys the unjust  a remnant will remain  and god is free to judge whether to redeem israel

amphipolis

amphipolis      is a municipality in the serres regional unit of greece  the seat of the municipality is rodolivos  it was an ancient greek polis  city   and later a roman city  whose large remains can still be seen 

amphipolis  an athenian colony  was the seat of the battle between the spartans and athenians in      bc  and also the place where alexander the great prepared for campaigns leading to his invasion of asia  alexander s three finest admirals  nearchus  androsthenes and laomedon  resided in amphipolis  which is also the place where  after alexander s death  his wife roxana and their small son alexander iv were exiled and later murdered 

excavations in and around the city have revealed important buildings  ancient walls and tombs  the finds are displayed at the archaeological museum of amphipolis  at the nearby vast kasta burial mound  an ancient macedonian tomb has recently been revealed  the lion of amphipolis monument nearby is a popular destination for visitors 

it was located within the region of edonis 

throughout the  th century bc  athens sought to consolidate its control over thrace  which was strategically important because of its primary materials  the gold and silver of the pangaion hills and the dense forests essential for naval construction   and the sea routes vital for athens  supply of grain from scythia  after a first unsuccessful attempt at colonisation in      bc by the milesian tyrant histiaeus  the athenians founded a first colony at ennea hodoi     nine ways     in      bc  but these first ten thousand colonists were massacred by the thracians  a second attempt took place in      bc on the same site under the guidance of hagnon  son of nicias  which was successful  the city and its first walls date from this time 

the new settlement took the name of amphipolis  literally   around the city    a name which is the subject of much debate about its etymology  thucydides claims the name comes from the fact that the strymon river flows  around the city  on two sides  however a note in the  suda   also given in the lexicon of photius  offers a different explanation apparently given by marsyas  son of periander  that a large proportion of the population lived  around the city   however  a more probable explanation is the one given by julius pollux  that the name indicates the vicinity of an isthmus 

amphipolis became the main power base of the athenians in thrace and  consequently  a target of choice for their spartan adversaries  the athenian population remained very much in the minority in the city  for this reason amphipolis remained an independent city and an ally of the athenians  rather than a colony or member of the athens led delian league  however  in      bc the spartan general brasidas easily took control of the city 

a rescue expedition led by the athenian general  and later historian  thucydides had to settle for securing eion and could not retake amphipolis  a failure for which thucydides was sentenced to exile  a new athenian force under the command of cleon failed once more in      bc during the battle of amphipolis at which both cleon and brasidas lost their lives  brasidas survived long enough to hear of the defeat of the athenians and was buried at amphipolis with impressive pomp  from then on he was regarded as the founder of the city
and honoured with yearly games and sacrifices 

the city itself kept its independence until the reign of king philip ii    despite several athenian attacks  notably because of the government of callistratus of aphidnae  in      bc  philip succeeded where the athenians had failed and conquered the city  thereby removing the obstacle which amphipolis presented to macedonian control over thrace  according to the historian theopompus  this conquest came to be the object of a secret accord between athens and philip ii  who would return the city in exchange for the fortified town of pydna  but the macedonian king betrayed the accord  refusing to cede amphipolis and laying siege to pydna as well 

the city was not immediately incorporated into the macedonian kingdom  and for some time preserved its institutions and a certain degree of autonomy  the border of macedonia was not moved further east  however  philip sent a number of macedonian governors to amphipolis  and in many respects the city was effectively  macedonianized   nomenclature  the calendar and the currency  the gold stater  created by philip to capitalise on the gold reserves of the pangaion hills  replaced the amphipolitan drachma  were all replaced by macedonian equivalents  in the reign of alexander the great  amphipolis was an important naval base  and the birthplace of three of the most famous macedonian admirals  nearchus  androsthenes and laomedon  whose burial place is most likely marked by the famous lion of amphipolis 

the importance of the city in this period is shown by alexander the great s decision that it was one of the six cities at which large luxurious temples costing       talents were built  alexander prepared for campaigns here against thrace in      bc and his army and fleet assembled near the port before the invasion of asia  the port was also used as naval base during his campaigns in asia  after alexander s death  his wife roxana and their young son alexander  iv were exiled by cassander and later murdered here 

throughout macedonian sovereignty amphipolis was a strong fortress of great strategic and economic importance  as shown by inscriptions  amphipolis became one of the main stops on the macedonian royal road  as testified by a border stone found between philippi and amphipolis giving the distance to the latter   and later on the  via egnatia   the principal roman road which crossed the southern balkans  apart from the ramparts of the lower town  the gymnasium and a set of well preserved frescoes from a wealthy villa are the only artifacts from this period that remain visible  though little is known of the layout of the town  modern knowledge of its institutions is in considerably better shape thanks to a rich epigraphic documentation  including a military ordinance of philip v and an ephebarchic law from the gymnasium 

after the final victory of rome over macedonia in the battle of pydna in      bc  amphipolis became the capital of one of the four mini republics  or  merides   which were created by the romans out of the kingdom of the antigonids which succeeded alexander s empire in macedon  these  merides  were gradually incorporated into the roman client state  and later province  of thracia  according to the  acts of the apostles   the apostles paul and silas passed through amphipolis in the early ad    s  on their journey between philippi and thessalonica  where hence they proselytized to the greeks  including epicurean and stoic philosophers 

during the period of late antiquity  amphipolis benefited from the increasing economic prosperity of macedonia  as is evidenced by the large number of christian churches that were built  significantly however  these churches were built within a restricted area of the town  sheltered by the walls of the acropolis  this has been taken as evidence that the large fortified perimeter of the ancient town was no longer defendable  and that the population of the city had considerably diminished 

nevertheless  the number  size and quality of the churches constructed between the  th and  th centuries are impressive  four basilicas adorned with rich mosaic floors and elaborate architectural sculptures  such as the ram headed column capitals     see picture  have been excavated  as well as a church with a hexagonal central plan which evokes that of the basilica of st vitalis in ravenna  it is difficult to find reasons for such municipal extravagance in such a small town  one possible explanation provided by the historian andr   boulanger is that an increasing    willingness    on the part of the wealthy upper classes in the late roman period to spend money on local gentrification projects  which he terms  euergetism   from the greek verb   meaning  i do good   was exploited by the local church to its advantage  which led to a mass gentrification of the urban centre and of the agricultural riches of the city s territory  amphipolis was also a diocese under the metropolitan see of thessalonica     the bishop of amphipolis is first mentioned in      the bishopric is today listed by the catholic church as a titular see 

the slavic invasions of the late  th century gradually encroached on the back country amphipolitan lifestyle and led to the decline of the town  during which period its inhabitants retreated to the area around the acropolis  the ramparts were maintained to a certain extent  thanks to materials plundered from the monuments of the lower city  and the large unused cisterns of the upper city were occupied by small houses and the workshops of artisans  around the middle of the  th century  a further reduction of the inhabited area of the city was followed by an increase in the fortification of the town  with the construction of a new rampart with pentagonal towers cutting through the middle of the remaining monuments  the acropolis  the roman baths  and especially the episcopal basilica were crossed by this wall 

the city was probably abandoned in the eighth century  as the last bishop was attested at the second council of nicaea in      its inhabitants probably moved to the neighbouring site of ancient eion  port of amphipolis  which had been rebuilt and refortified in the byzantine period under the name    chrysopolis     this small port continued to enjoy some prosperity  before being abandoned during the ottoman period  the last recorded sign of activity in the region of amphipolis was the construction of a fortified tower to the north in      by the  megas primikerios  john and the  stratopedarches  alexios to protect the land that they had given to the monastery of pantokrator on mount athos 

the site was discovered and described by many travellers and archaeologists during the   th century  including e  cousin  ry         engraver   leon heuzey         and p  perdrizet                however  excavations did not truly begin until after the second world war  the greek archaeological society under d  lazaridis excavated in      and       uncovering a necropolis  the city wall  see photograph   the basilicas  and the acropolis  further excavations have since uncovered the river bridge  the gymnasium  greek and roman villas and numerous tombs etc 

parts of the lion monument and tombs were discovered during world war i by bulgarian and british troops whilst digging trenches in the area  in       m  feyel  of the   cole fran  aise d ath  nes  efa   led an epigraphical mission to the site and uncovered further remains of the lion monument  a reconstruction was given in the  bulletin de correspondance hell  nique   a publication of the efa which is available on line  

the silver ossuary containing the cremated remains of brasidas and a gold crown  see image  was found in a tomb in pride of place under the agora 

in      greek archaeologists unearthed a large tomb within the kasta hill  the biggest burial mound in greece  northeast of amphipolis  the large size of the tumulus indicates the prominence of the burials made there  the perimeter wall of the tumulus is long  and is made of limestone covered with marble 

the tomb comprises three chambers separated by walls  there are two sphinxes just outside the entrance to the tomb  two of the columns supporting the roof in the first section are in the form of caryatids  in the  th century bc style  the excavation revealed a pebble mosaic showing the abduction of persephone by hades directly behind the caryatids and in front of the macedonian marble door leading to the  third  chamber  hades  chariot is drawn by two white horses and led to the underworld by hermes  the mosaic verifies the macedonian character of the tomb  as the head of one of the sphinxes was found inside the tomb behind the broken door  it is clear that there were intruders  probably in antiquity 

the identity of the burial remains unknown and the excavation is continuing  dr  katerina peristeri  the archaeologist heading the excavation of the tomb  dates the tomb to the late  th century bc  the period after the death of alexander the great       bc  

in november       the greek minister of culture  lydia koniordou  announced that the grave should be accessible to the public in about three years  the financing for the necessary construction project should amount to around         million euros          million is to be spent by the region of central macedonia          million is to be taken from the interreg fund of the european union  in the course of this measure  building materials of the grave site  which were later used by the romans elsewhere  will be rebuilt in their original location  the work should begin in      or      and last for around one year

amram

in the book of exodus  amram    is the husband of jochebed and father of aaron  moses and miriam  

alternative spellings of the name include  

in addition to being married to jochebed  amram is also described in the bible as having been related to jochebed prior to the marriage  although the exact relationship is uncertain  some greek and latin manuscripts of the septuagint state that jochebed was amram s father s cousin  and others state that amram was jochebed s cousin  but the masoretic text states that she was his father s sister  he is praised for his faith in the epistle to the hebrews 

textual scholars attribute the biblical genealogy to the book of generations  a hypothetically reconstructed document theorized to originate from a similar religiopolitical group and date to the priestly source  according to critical scholars  the torah s genealogy for levi s descendants  is actually an aetiological myth reflecting the fact that there were four different groups among the levites     the gershonites  kohathites  merarites  and aaronids  aaron     the eponymous ancestor of the aaronids     could not be portrayed as a brother to gershon  kohath  and merari  as the narrative about the birth of moses  brother of aaron   which textual scholars attribute to the earlier elohist source  mentions only that  both  his parents were levites  without identifying their names   critical scholars suspect that the elohist account offers both matrilineal and patrilineal descent from levites in order to magnify the religious credentials of moses 

 amram  is arabicized to     imr  n        commentators of the quran have linked two individuals to the arabic name  they are unanimous in asserting that imran in verse is clearly the father of mary  mother of jesus  whose genealogy  according to al tabari  traces back to david  however  they disagreed whether the imran mentioned in verse was the father of moses and aaron  or mary  according to islam  imran was a noble man 

according to the septuagint  amram s family tree would be as follows 

according to the masoretic text  amram s family tree would be 

according to the book of jasher  amram s family tree would be 

in the apocryphal  testament of levi   it is stated that amram was born  as a grandson of levi  when levi was    years old  the exodus rabbah argues that when the pharaoh instructed midwives to throw male children into the nile  amram divorced jochebed  who was three months pregnant with moses at the time  arguing that there was no justification for the israelite men to father children if they were just to be killed  however  the text goes on to state that miriam  his daughter  chided him for his lack of care for his wife s feelings  persuading him to recant and marry jochebed again  according to the talmud  amram promulgated the laws of marriage and divorce amongst the jews in egypt  the talmud also argues that amram had extreme longevity  which he used to ensure that doctrines were preserved through several generations 

despite the legend of his divorce and remarriage  amram was also held to have been entirely sinless throughout his life  and was rewarded for this by his corpse remaining without any signs of decay  the other three ancient israelites who died without sin  being benjamin  jesse and chileab 

according to the book of jubilees  amram was among the israelites who took the bones of jacob s sons  excluding those of joseph  to canaan for burial in the cave of machpelah  most of the israelites then returned to egypt but some remained in canaan  including amram who only returned somewhere up to forty years later 

one of the dead sea scrolls   q     manuscript b  is written from amram s point of view  and hence has been dubbed the  visions of amram   the document is dated to the  nd century bc and  in the form of a vision  briefly discusses dualism and the watchers 




amyntas i of macedon

amyntas i  greek                  a        bc  was king of the ancient greek kingdom of macedon                    bc  and then a vassal of darius i from         to his death     bc  at the time of achaemenid macedonia  he was a son of alcetas i of macedon  he married eurydice and they had a son alexander 

amyntas was a vassal of darius i  king of the persian achaemenid empire  since         bc  amyntas gave the present of  earth and water  to megabazus  which symbolized submission to the achaemenid emperor  one of the daughters of amyntas  named gygaea  was married to the persian general  called bubares  possibly as a way of reinforcing the alliance  

the history of macedonia may be said to begin with amyntas  reign  he was the first of its rulers to have diplomatic relations with other states  
in particular  he entered into an alliance with hippias of athens  and when hippias was driven out of athens he offered him the territory of anthemus on the thermaic gulf with the object of taking advantage of the feuds between the greeks  
hippias refused the offer and also rejected the offer of iolcos  as amyntas probably did not control anthemous at that time  but was merely suggesting a plan of joint occupation to hippias 


 




amyntas iii of macedon

amyntas iii  ancient macedonia  makedonia  died     bc  was king of the ancient macedonian kingdom of macedon in     bc  and again from     to     bc  he was the son of arrhidaeus and grandson of amyntas  one of the sons of alexander i  his most famous son is philip ii  father of alexander the great  he is historically considered the founder of the unified macedonian state 

he came to the throne after the ten years of confusion which followed the death of archelaus i  but he had many enemies at home  in     he was driven out by the illyrians  but in the following year  with the aid of the thessalians  he recovered his kingdom  medius  head of the house of the aleuadae of larissa  is believed to have provided aid to amyntas in recovering his throne  the mutual relationship between the argeadae and the aleuadae dates to the time of archelaus 

to shore up his country against the threat of the illyrians  amyntas established an alliance with the chalkidian league led by olynthus  in exchange for this support  amyntas granted them rights to macedonian timber  which was sent back to athens to help fortify their fleet  with money flowing into olynthus from these exports  their power grew  in response  amyntas sought additional allies  he established connections with kotys  chief of the odrysians  kotys had already married his daughter to the athenian general iphicrates  prevented from marrying into kotys  family  amyntas soon adopted iphicrates as his son 

after the king s peace     bc  sparta was anxious to re establish its presence in northern greece  in     bc  bardylis and his illyrians attacked epirus instigated and aided by dionysius i of syracuse  in an attempt to restore the molossian king alcetas i of epirus to the throne  when amyntas sought spartan aid against the growing threat of olynthus  the spartans eagerly responded  that olynthus was backed by athens and thebes  rivals to sparta for the control of greece  provided them with an additional incentive to break up this growing power in the north  amyntas thus concluded a treaty with the spartans  who assisted him to reduce olynthus        he also entered into a league with jason of pherae  and assiduously cultivated the friendship of athens  in     bc at a panhellenic congress of the lacedaemonian allies  he voted in support of the athenians  claim and joined other greeks in voting to help athens to recover possession of amphipolis 

with olynthus defeated  amyntas was now able to conclude a treaty with athens and keep the timber revenues for himself  amyntas shipped the timber to the house of the athenian timotheus  in piraeus 

amyntas married eurydice  daughter of sirras of lynkestis  circa      by her  amyntas had three sons  all of whom became kings of macedonia one after the other  and a daughter 

justin also mentions that amyntas had three sons by another wife  gygaea  probably an argead   archelaus  arrhidaeus and menelaus  the fact that they did not try to take the throne before the    s suggests that they were younger than amyntas  children by eurydice  they were ultimately eliminated by their half brother philip ii because they had a claim to the throne 

amyntas died at an advanced age  leaving his throne to his eldest son  alexander ii 







anacharsis

anacharsis      was a scythian philosopher who travelled from his homeland on the northern shores of the black sea to athens in the early  th century bc and made a great impression as a forthright  outspoken  barbarian   reputedly a forerunner of the cynics  none of his works has survived 

anacharsis the son of gnurus  a scythian chief  was half greek and from a mixed hellenic culture  apparently in the region of the cimmerian bosporus  he left his native country to travel in pursuit of knowledge  and came to athens about     bc  at a time when solon was occupied with his legislative measures 

according to the story recounted by hermippus  anacharsis arrived at the house of solon and said   i have traveled here from afar to make you my friend   solon replied   it s better to make friends at home   thereupon the scythian replied   then it is necessary for you  being at home  to make friends with me   solon laughed and accepted him as his friend 

anacharsis cultivated the outsider s knack of seeing the illogic in familiar things  for example  plutarch remarks that he  expressed his wonder at the fact that in greece wise men spoke and fools decided   his conversation was droll and frank  and solon and the athenians took to him as a sage and philosopher  his rough and free discourse became proverbial among athenians as  scythian discourse  

anacharsis was the first foreigner  metic  who received the privileges of athenian citizenship  he was reckoned by some ancient authors as one of the seven sages of greece  and it is said that he was initiated into the eleusinian mysteries of the great goddess  a privilege denied to those who did not speak fluent greek
